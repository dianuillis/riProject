Holding



Respondents' method for converting numerical information from binary-coded decimal numbers into pure binary numbers, for use in programming conventional general-purpose digital computers is merely a series of mathematical calculations or mental steps and does not constitute a patentable  process  within the meaning of the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. 100 (b). Pp. 64-73.

Laws applied

101 of the 
Patent Act of 1952



 Gottschalk v Benson , 
409 U.S.  63 (
1972) was a 

United States Supreme Court
 case that ruled that a process involving a numerical 
algorithm was not 
patentable if  the patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself . The court added  it is said that the decision precludes a patent for any program servicing a computer. We do not so hold.  The case was argued on 
October 16, 
1972 and was decided 
November 20, 1972.


Prior history


The case revolves around an 
application for a patent for method for converting a binary-coded decimal (BCD) numerals into pure binary numerals on a general purpose digital computer. The 
patent examiner at the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the patent application as being directed to a mathematical expression.  Pure mathematical expressions had been held to be unpatentable under earlier patent laws in 
Mackay Co. v. Radio Corp. 
306 U.S.  86 (1939).  The applicant appealed to the 
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.  The Board affirmed the examiner s rejection.  The applicant further appealed to the 
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.  The Court reversed the Board.  Finally, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks filed a petition for a 
writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.




The case


The law which is applicable to this case is section 101 of the 
Patent Act of 1952
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Gottschalk_v._Benson#endnote_1. The question was whether or not the 
claimed 
invention was a  process  under the law.  The court held that because the claim was not limited to any particular type of programmable digital computer and because the method could be carried out mentally, that the claim would effectively preclude use of the method for any currently known or future invention in any field.  Thus the claim was directed to an algorithm alone and therefore was not patentable.




Impact



This decision was widely seen as confirming that software by itself was not directly patentable.  What 
patent attorneys/agents had been doing in the meantime, however, was to get patent protection on software inventions by claiming both the algorithm in combination with the computer carrying out the algorithm.  Thus they were technically claiming a new machine and this was held to be patentable.  1 


The boundary between when a computer implemented process is purely an abstract idea (and thus not patentable) and when it is a practical process (and thus is patentable) is still a matter of debate within the US patent office. ( The Supreme Court has not been clear . . . . . . as to whether such subject matter is excluded from the scope of 101 because it represents laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.  )2




Notes





 
^ Section 101 says,  Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.  Section 100(b) gives the definition for process,  The term  process  means process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.

French
 
mathematician and 
computer scientist. She is Directrice de Recherche
at the French 
CNRS, at 
Universite de Caen

number theory
http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/number_theorists.html and 
analysis of algorithms. Amongst the algorithms she had studied, are the celebrated 
LLL algorithm 
used for basis reductions in 

Euclidean lattice
 and the different 







Euclidean algorithm






s to determine 
GCD. The main tool used to achieve her results is the so called dynamical analysis. Loosely speaking, it is a mix between analysis of algorithms and dynamical systems. Brigitte Vallee greatly contributed to develop 
this method. 

In the early 90s, Brigitte Vallee's work on small modular squares allowed her to hold the fastest 
factorisation algorithm with a proved probabilistic complexity bound. Nowadays, other factorisation algorithms are faster.
