 History </st>
<p>

RIT Ambulance receives its right to function from the New York State Department of Health, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and the RIT Student Health Center. It originated from the Student Safety which in 1981 became a certified ambulance corps known as RIT Emergency Medical Unit.  It has since been renamed to RIT Ambulance.  </p>
<p>

For many years the RIT Ambulance Corps was only dispatched to emergencies by <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://finweb.rit.edu/publicsafety">
RIT Public Safety</weblink>, but in 1993 became a <county wordnetid="108546183" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Organizational Structure</st>
<p>

RIT Ambulance is governed by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../253/5253.xml">
constitution</link> which defines two different organizational divisions.  The Executive Board is the primary body for organizational oversight and personnel management.  The Operations Staff is in charge of handling the day to day issues of the ambulance corps.  The structure of these groups are listed below.</p>
<p>

The Executive Board is elected by the membership.  Positions are filled every year at the annual meeting, and as vacancies occur.  The only member of the Operations Staff that is elected by the membership is the Chief of Operations.  The Chief is then responsible for appointing well qualified personnel to the Operations Staff for the positions of Deputy Chief, Lieutenants and Training Director.  The membership then votes to ratify these appointments at the next monthly membership meeting.</p>
<p>

Meetings are held for both bodies on a regular basis.  Generally, the Executive Board meets on a weekly basis while the Operations Staff holds meetings on a bi-weekly basis.  The meetings are open to all that choose to attend except for small portions of closed discussion on private and sensitive issues.</p>
