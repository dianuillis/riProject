<b>Cielo Nature Sanctuary</b> pronounced  <it>chay-low</it>) is a 100-acre (0.40&nbsp;km2) privately managed wildlife sanctuary located in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../066/95066.xml">
Mecosta County</link>, <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/18859.xml">
Michigan</link></country>
 near the City of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../102/118102.xml">
Big Rapids</link>.  The objective of the sanctuary is to enhance the habitat of the sanctuary for the benefit of the fish and wildlife which live within or migrate through the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/73213.xml">
sanctuary</link>.

 The Land</st>
<p>

The terrain at <b>Cielo</b> is incredibly diverse. From non-tidal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/169208.xml">
marsh</link> to mature northern hardwoods, the land is fertile and nurtures a healthy vibrant <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/9632.xml">
ecosystem</link>. The landscape is rolling in elevation and no less than 13 soil types are found throughout. Rocky deposits are found throughout Cielo, a result of Michigan's last <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../659/4562659.xml">
glacial retreat</link> about 14,000 years ago. It is the sanctuaryâ€™s diversity of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../317/1596317.xml">
habitat</link> that is the foundation upon which Cielo's wildlife management plan has found success.
The mineral and oil composition of Cielo is largely unknown although areas of Mecosta County are know to have abundant reserves of crude oil.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

 The Water </st>

<p>

<b>Cielo's</b> water resources are a key ingredient to its unique <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/9632.xml">
ecosystem</link>.

 Four highly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/6939758.xml">
eutrophic</link> ponds are located on the property. Most are no more than three feet deep, and were formed as a result of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/4399.xml">
beaver</link>s damming flowing water.<image location="right" width="150px" src="huntlake1.jpg" type="thumb">

Hunt Lake

</image>
 The largest body of water is Hunt Lake which is 10 acres in size. It has a very large 11 acre area of flooded timber on the North end of the lake known as Hunt Marsh; a result of this same beaver activity creating the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/1511546.xml">
impoundment</link> blocking Enzo Creek, the only outlet to Hunt lake which runs East and ultimately into Ryan Creek.  Hunt lake has a maximum depth of 30&nbsp;feet (9.1&nbsp;m) and visibility generally exceeds 5&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m) despite a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../196/46196.xml">
marl</link> substrate.</p>
<p>

Nehmer lake is also accessible from <b>Cielo</b>.  It is approximately 8&nbsp;acres (32,000&nbsp;m2) in size, and although shallower than Hunt lake, it has a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../326/581326.xml">
littoral zone</link> of flooded timber along its margins.  The maximum depth is unknown.<image location="right" width="150px" src="spiderwebs.jpg" type="thumb">

<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/778246.xml">
flora</link> found at <b>Cielo</b> has yet to be comprehensively inventoried, as the project would be a colossal undertaking.  Tree types of obvious notation include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/66722.xml">

Selective harvest of aspen was done in 2003 to improve habitat for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/327559.xml">
Ruffed Grouse</link> and other upland birds such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../071/297071.xml">
Wild Turkey</link>.  Low impact selective harvest proved to be a successful project.</p>
<p>

In 2006, several stands of conifers were planted for future economic timber value and also to provide dense cover for several wildlife species.  Approximately 750 Red Pines were planted in a two acre stand primarily for future economic timber value and 500 Jack Pine were planted in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../470/46470.xml">
fallow</link> area with poor soil types suitable for Jack Pine but not conducive to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/246828.xml">
forage</link> plants to serve as a future area of dense cover for wildlife.</p>

Elaeagnus umbellata</link> (Autumn Olive) was planted in the 1950s under the recommendation of the then Michigan Department of Conservation (now known as the Michigan Department of Natural Resources) as the shrub was believed to be very beneficial to wildlife. It is now know to be invasive and an 8-acre (32,000&nbsp;m2) area was cut back in 2006 and converted to a hayland. <image location="right" width="150px" src="Cieloautumn.jpg" type="thumb">

<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/722672.xml">
fauna</link> found at <b>Cielo</b> is as diverse as its flora.  It is the abundance of appropriate habitat which makes it possible to view wildlife within the sanctuary.  On any given day, one may see Whitetail <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/38428.xml">

<p>

The abundance of wildlife is spectacular at <b>Cielo</b>.  It is the waterfowl habitat that makes Cielo so unique.  In autumn, when waterfowl are migrating, <b>Cielo</b> is home to many species of waterfowl.  Most abundant are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../112/252112.xml">
Wood Duck</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../456/230456.xml">
Mallards</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../972/218972.xml">
Canada Geese</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/230937.xml">
Teal</link>.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/68005.xml">
Loons</link> also take up residence on Hunt Lake and their presence is known by their unique 'cry' at twilight, although the birds prefer <lake wordnetid="109328904" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../050/10154050.xml">
Townline Lake</link></lake>
 (located 600&nbsp;ft (180&nbsp;m) to the East of <b>Cielo</b>) due to its size.  </p>
<p>

In 2006 one Wood Duck nesting box was installed at Cielo and a resident hen successfully hatched two ducklings while taking up residence.  In 2007, two additional nesting boxes were installed to help provide optimal nesting habitat.  In October 2007 a check was made on one of the nexting boxes installed in the spring and there was no sign of nesting activity.  It is speculated that the abundance of other natural nesting habitat precluded it from use.    </p>
<p>

Hunt Marsh is also home to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/198509.xml">
Great Blue Heron</link>, the largest in the heron family with a wing span of seven feet. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../100/17100.xml">
Kingfisher</link> are observed on a frequent basis as they ambush fish, a staple in their diet.</p>
<p>

Hunt Marsh would not exist without the activity of the world's second largest rodent: the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/4399.xml">
Beaver</link>.  Beaver remain very active in the marsh and any novice can identify their trademark 'stump' left behind.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../662/571662.xml">
Muskrat</link> are also abundant and seen traveling throughout the lakes, ponds, marsh and even Enzo Creek.</p>
<p>

 is also prevalent on Hunt Lake and Hunt Marsh.  Able to swim for nearly a mile underwater when disturbed, they often seem to disappear without a trace.  When observed, they are without question one of the most amazing creatures to observe as they are often socially playful with one another.  Of special note is the River Otter's acute sensitivity to any form of environmental pollution, as it generally vacates any area with tainted water quality very quickly.  Their existence at Cielo is a testament to the water quality within the Nature Sanctuary.</p>
<p>

<b>Cielo</b> is home to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../800/642800.xml">
Blanding's Turtle</link>, which is threatened and even endangered within its range.  These turtles do not reach sexual maturity until they are 18-20 years old and may live to be as old as 70 years old!

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../872/440872.xml">
Common Snapping Turtle</link> can be found in the spring nesting in sandy areas of the preserve.  Rarely do they pose a threat if encountered in water, but on land they can be very aggressive if disturbed.<image location="right" width="150px" src="cieloturtle.jpg" type="thumb">

Hunt Lake harbors a vibrant fishery.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/86777.xml">
Northern Pike</link> is at the top of the food chain, and considering it is such a small body of water, Hunt's pike are in balance with the forage available in the lake.  Most are in the 3â€“5 year class, but much older fish are also found.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../843/48843.xml">
Largemouth Bass</link> are also part of the food pyramid, but to a much lesser extent.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../319/554319.xml">
Bluegill</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../166/1217166.xml">
Yellow Perch</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/5526974.xml">
Emerald shiner</link> make up the bulk of the forage base.  A complete fishery survey had not yet been completed as of 2007.  Strangely, a four year old Muskellunge was identified in Hunt Lake in 2006 and it unclear if this fish was the sole representative of its species or if a small reproductive population exists.</p>
<p>

Nehmer Lake is similar in resources as Hunt Lake.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../244/41244.xml">
Hybrid</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../343/47343.xml">
Sunfish</link> have been stocked on several occasions, however, their survival in abundance has been curtailed due to predation by Northern Pike.</p>
<p>

In an April 2007 spring waterfowl survey, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/4401.xml">
American Bald Eagle</link> was observed soaring low over Hunt Lake. Bald Eagles often hunt over the <stream wordnetid="109448361" confidence="0.8">

</body_of_water>
</stream>
 which is located approximately 1-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) West of Cielo.  Evidence of nesting activity at Cielo has not been confirmed.  </p>
<p>

In this same survey, several migratory <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/264547.xml">
Bufflehead</link> were viewed waddling in a pool below one of Hunt Marsh's several beaver dams.  Bufflehead are arguably one of the most colorful species of waterfowl which pass through Cielo each spring and fall.  In route from the bird's Southern winter range to Canadian's Boreal Forest or <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">
