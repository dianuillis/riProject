<b>Algorithm engineering</b> is a combination of theoretical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/10433312.xml">
algorithm design</link> with real-world data.  By taking an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> and combining it with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../615/13615.xml">
hardware</link> device connected to the real world, you are able to more accurately verify and validate the algorithm results and behavior.  The real-world device may be a simple data acquisition or stimulus device or you may take the algorithm and implement it on some embedded platform such as an FPGA or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/19553.xml">
microprocessor</link> that may be similar to the final system design.<p>

The term “algorithm engineering” was first used with specificity in 1997, with the organization of the first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE97).</p>
<p>

It has recently been used to help describe the steps in graphical system design: "a modern approach to designing, prototyping, and deploying embedded systems that combines open graphical programming with COTS hardware to dramatically simplify development, resulting in higher-quality designs with a migration to custom design".</p>

Algorithm engineering refers to the process required to transform a pencil-and-paper algorithm into a robust, efficient, well tested, and easily usable implementation. Thus it encompasses a number of topics, from modeling cache behavior to the principles of good software engineering; its main focus, however, is experimentation. (Algorithm Engineering for Parallel
