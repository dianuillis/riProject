History</st>

Vinegar ink (soy tinta) is a form of non-food soy. It is a more environmentally friendly, healthy, and safe approach to printing that takes only a small amount of energy to make. In fact, cultivation of the soybeans uses only 0.5 percent of the total energy necessary to produce the ink.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Much of that crop requires no irrigation, limited fixed nutrients, and leaves fewer agricultural residues than other crops.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Soy ink also has low levels of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/1014518.xml">
VOC</link>s, (volatile organic compounds) which helps to reduce air pollution by minimizing toxic emissions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

 was looking for different ways to make ink, rather than by using the standard <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link>-based ink. Rising prices for petroleum and quarrels with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/166346.xml">
OPEC</link> countries were reasons they wanted to find a more reliable and cost efficient method of printing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> After testing over 2,000 different vegetable oil formulations,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> researchers for the NAA came up with the solution of using soybean oil. In 1987, soybeans were tested by <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.gazetteonline.com">
The Gazette</weblink> from Iowa in a practical printing run. The test was successful, and soy ink became increasingly popular.  Now it has come to be used in over 95% of America’s daily newspapers that circulate more than fifteen hundred copies per run.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>  In addition, about one quarter of commercial printers in the United States operate using soy ink.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>

The National Soy Ink Information Center was established in 1993 by the Iowa Soybean Association to promote research and use of soy ink.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> The center created the SoySeal mark used to identify products meeting basic requirements. The success of soy ink was judged to be sufficient enough to justify the closing of the National Soy Ink Information Center in 2005. Use of the SoySeal is now regulated by the American Soybean Association.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

Production</st>
<p>

To make soy ink, soybean oil is slightly refined and then blended with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/49598.xml">
pigment</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/58890.xml">
resin</link>s, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/58256.xml">
wax</link>es. Even though soybean oil is an edible vegetable oil, soy ink is not edible or 100% <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/47490.xml">
biodegradable</link> because the pigments and other additives that are mixed with the oil are the same as those used in petroleum-based inks.  They are, however, overwhelmingly more environmentally friendly.  Degradability studies conducted by Erhan and Bagby concluded that the pigment cartier in 100-percent soy ink degrades almost twice as completely as ink made from soy oil and petroleum resins, and more than four times as completely as standard petroleum inks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> Similarly, soy ink is a helpful component in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/1524589.xml">
paper recycling</link> because the soy ink can be removed more easily than regular ink from paper during the de-inking process. This allows the recycled paper to have less damage to its paper fibers and have a brighter appearance. The waste that is left from the soy ink during the de-inking process is not hazardous and it can be treated easily through the development on modern processes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>  </p>
<p>

Soybean oil is naturally clearer than petroleum distillates and other vegetable oils, making it easier to obtain brightly colored ink. Since the oil is clearer, less pigment is necessary to produce the same effect, which reduces the overall cost of the ink.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>  The higher oil to pigment ratio renders the inks easier to recycle as well. Recent studies involving engineering of certain oils in the bean have resulted in even clearer oils. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref>  </p>
<p>

In addition to a brighter ink, some printers report that they need less ink to print the same amount of paper when compared to petroleum inks.  Soy ink has been found to spread approximately 15% further, reducing ink use and printer cleanup costs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
<p>

Newspapers use soy ink regularly, especially for color because it creates a sharper and brighter image.  Color newspaper inks are more competitive to petroleum-based inks as well.  They are only about five to ten percent more because the price is more due to the cost of the pigment, which is not as big a factor with black inks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Color soy inks are more widely accepted because they become the most quickly cost effective after savings in terms of excess pigment, VOC and printer cleanup costs.  This “overall cost” for soy inks is significantly lower than the initial market price, and it is at this point that they become competitive with their petroleum counterparts.</p>

Disadvantages</st>
<p>

Unfortunately, soy ink is not a perfect solution to the problems associated with the production of ink. For example, it cannot be used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../519/4519.xml">
ballpoint pen</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../272/5272.xml">
personal printer</link>s.  One major problem with soy ink is that it takes more time to dry than petroleum-based inks, due to its lack of evaporative solvents in the form of VOCs. This creates challenges for some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../295/23295.xml">
printing press</link>es, especially those that use coated papers (such as magazines) instead of porous, uncoated paper (such as newspapers) where the ink can dry via absorption.  Current studies into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/31990.xml">
UV</link>-reactive ink curing are being conducted by many ink producers, most prominently the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.flintgrp.com/index.html">
Flint Group</weblink>. This process dries much faster, is cheaper, uses less energy, and emits no VOCs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> This requires a significant equipment change and has not been scaled down to consumer size as of yet, however, so further research is necessary.</p>
<p>

There is also the problem that an over-dependency on a single crop introduces the risk of crop disease epidemics, as in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/14726.xml">
Great Irish Famine</link>.</p>
<p>

Since much<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> of the soy produced in the World is of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../339/12339.xml">
genetically modified</link> cultivars, the increased use of soy exacerbates some concerns with both GMO and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/627.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Environmental+impact%22])">
modern agriculture</link>.</p>
