In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/21506.xml">
numerical analysis</link> the <b>minimum degree algorithm</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> used to permute the rows and columns of  a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/126474.xml">
symmetric</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/341015.xml">
sparse matrix</link> before applying the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../433/134433.xml">
Cholesky decomposition</link>, to reduce the number of non-zeros in the Cholesky factor.
This results in reduced storage requirements and means that the Cholesky factor, or sometimes an incomplete Cholesky factor used as a preconditioner (for example in the preconditioned <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/1448821.xml">
conjugate gradient</link> algorithm) can be applied with fewer arithmetic operations.<p>

Minimum degree algorithms are often used in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/18233581.xml">
finite element method</link> where the reordering of nodes can be carried out depending only on the topology of the mesh, rather than the coefficients in the partial differential equation, resulting in efficiency savings when the same mesh is used for a variety of coefficient values.</p>

Given a linear system
<indent level="1">

<math> \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}</math>
</indent>
where <b>A</b> is an <math>n \times n</math> real symmetric sparse square matrix the Cholesky factor <b>L</b> will typically suffer 'fill in', that is have more non-zeros than the upper triangle of <b>A</b>. We seek a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../849/238849.xml">
permutation matrix</link> <b>P</b> , so that the matrix
<math>\mathbf{P}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{P}</math>, which is also symmetric, has the least possible fill in its Cholesky factor. We solve the  reordered system
<indent level="1">

<math> \left(\mathbf{P}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{P}\right) \left(\mathbf{P}^T\mathbf{x}\right) = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{b}.</math>

linear programming</link> problems, which is loosely described as follows. At each step in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/13035.xml">
Gaussian elimination</link> row and column permutations are performed so as to minimize the number of off diagonal non-zeros in the pivot row and column. A symmetric version
of Markowitz method was described by Tinney and Walker in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/34749.xml">
1967</link> and Rose later derived a graph theoretic version of the algorithm where the factorization is only simulated, and this was named the minimum degree algorithm. The graph referred to is the graph with <it>n</it> vertices, with vertices <it>i</it> and <it>j</it> connected by an edge when <math>a_{ij} \ne 0</math>, and the <it>degree</it> is the degree of the vertices. A crucial aspect of such algorithms is a tie breaking strategy when there is a  choice of renumbering resulting in the same degree.</p>
