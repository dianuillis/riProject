</b> over environmental and health and safety related issues as well as in respect of its businesses practices and priorities. In recent times Shell’s management has acknowledged some of these problems and has promised to take steps to repair damage done both to the affected parties and to its own reputation, which has involved tightening internal controls between its different subsidiaries, an ostensible commitment to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/398356.xml">

 which led to the imposition of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/26785.xml">
sanctions</link> by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../769/31769.xml">
United Nations</link>. These sanctions included strict controls on oil and petroleum product sales to the rebel colony. In 1978 the "<link>

British government</link> which had been written by Shell's Chairman Sir <link>
Frank McFadzean</link> in June 1976 which said that "... no company in which we [Shell] have an interest is supplying to Rhodesia". The Bingham report revealed that shipments to Rhodesia had arrived at the old petroleum port of Lourenco Marques (now <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/57044.xml">

Corruption in Italy</st>

<p>

In the early 1970s, Shell decided to dispose of the heavily loss making business of Shell Italiana - its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/1977933.xml">
downstream</link> operation in Italy. Assets were sold to the Italian state company <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../612/2708612.xml">
Eni</link></company>
 in 1973. Subsequent to the sale, Shell’s accountants and outside auditors discovered that in the five years prior to the sale to <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../612/2708612.xml">
Eni</link></company>
 Italian politicians had received “political contributions” totalling around £2.5 million from Shell Italiana’s local management.   These had been recorded in the company’s books as “advertising and publicity” expenses. Shell’s General Manager in Italy, who had operated without authority and who had misrecorded the payments, was dismissed ["A Century in Oil", page 324].</p>

Retirement fund deficiencies in Malaysia</st>

In September 2004, 399 ex-employees of Shell  won a lawsuit at the Miri High Court in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/3607937.xml">

 concerning the administration by the defendant Shell Group companies of Shell employee retirement funds. The Shell companies in question - <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/28258.xml">
Sarawak</link> Shell Bhd and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/28678.xml">
Sabah</link> Shell Petroleum Co Ltd - were ordered to pay nearly RM100 million to the plaintiffs, 399 former employees known as Project Team A, who filed their suit on 29 November 2002 alleging  an unlawful deduction from their retirement funds. According to a <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://shell2004.com/2004%20Documents/rsodds/sarawak_news26sept04.htm">
report</weblink> of the hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs objected to an application by Shell for a stay on the grounds that <it>“a majority of the plaintiffs are well over the age of 60 and in weak and declining health”.</it> A <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://shell2004.com/2004%20Documents/newassorted/new_straits_times7oct04.htm">

 published on 7 October 2004 reported in relation to the  former Shell employees, that <it>“Some have died. Others are losing their memory and many are ailing.”</it> According to another news report, the suit was said to be the first <it>"in the legal history of Malaysia involving the largest number of ex-employees suing their former employers and involving such a big claim".</it> The defendants filed an appeal against the decision. </p>
<p>

The Malaysian Court of Appeal <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://shell2004.com/week42/new_straits_times18october2005.htm">
decided</weblink> in October 2005 that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and in a <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.shellnews.net/sarawak/399_teama-2007.pdf">
judgment</weblink> dated 30 March 2007, overturned the judgment. According to one <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2007/09/25/corruption-crisis-in-malaysian-judiciary-impacts-on-shell-litigation/">
report</weblink>, when announcing the decision in court, one of the three Appeal Court judges stated as grounds for the decision: <it>“we don’t believe a company like Shell would do anything like this to employees”</it>. In paragraph 26 on page 24 of the judgment it was stated in reference to Shell: <it>“…to deduct employer’s EPF contributions from the lump sum would not only expose them to accusations of illegal action and fraud on employees but would result in no employee getting any benefit from the RBF and in the RBF becoming a futile exercise, and it is inconceivable that those companies would embark on such an absurd, pointless and perilous undertaking.”</it> </p>

This corresponds to roughly 13% of the previous proven reserves base.

In March 2004 <it>The Economist</it> reported that US law firm Berger &amp; Montague had claimed that Shell “recklessly violated accounting rules and guidelines, which resulted in an enormous and shocking overstatement of oil and gas reserves" (the law firm was then suing Shell on behalf of shareholders claiming that the overstatement had harmed shareholders as they had “severely overstated” the firm's market value). The Economist further reported that Berger was only one of several law firms launching cases. The article went on to imply that the reserves recategorisation was the result of active, long term problems, calling it "a scam of Enron proportions." <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NVDNRVP">

24 August</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link>, the UK financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (the FSA) <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/final/shell_24aug04.pdf">
announced</weblink> that it had imposed a penalty of £17 million pounds (UK) on The “Shell” Transport and Trading Company p.l.c. and The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company NV. The FSA considered that: <it>"Shell announced false or misleading proved reserves and reserves replacement ratios to the market throughout the period 1998 to 2003 inclusive."</it> The FSA also considered that Shell’s misconduct amounted to <it>“market abuse”</it> on the basis that the market <it>“was likely to have been, given a false or misleading impression as to the price or value of UK listed Shell shares…”</it>(p11: para60) The FSA further considered that Shell’s actions were particularly serious, meriting a substantial penalty. However, the level of penalty reflected the high degree of cooperation which Shell had shown during the FSA investigation. On the same date, the SEC <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article474064.ece">

 that involves the piping of oil and gas to an oil terminal and the construction of Russia's first liquefied natural gas <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/832128.xml">
LNG</link> plant. The project was controversial from the start for cost, environmental and community relations reasons. In the summer of 2005 Sakhalin Energy, the project operator, doubled its estimated capital costs to around $20 billion and LNG production was delayed until 2008. Shell expressed surprise at this huge increase. Environmental reasons accounted for part of the budgetary errors. </p>
<p>

The originally negotiated contract was a “production sharing agreement” which gave the Russian state revenues only after Shell and the other partner companies had recouped their costs and made a substantial return on their investments. Thus Shell was substantially protected from cost overruns which would lead to lower and later income for Russia (and for Shell). This was the main reason for the Russians to insist on a new deal, involving <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../489/320489.xml">

 said that it would have a "negative impact on Sakhalin's people and environment". The timing of this attack was difficult for Shell and the other consortium partners as they were seeking financing for the project from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../963/37963.xml">
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</link> (EBRD) at that time. </p>
<p>

The spiraling project costs and other difficulties have continued to undermine confidence in Shell's reputation for good project management. On 22 October 2006 an article in The Observer <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1928280,00.html">
reported</weblink> that a leaked internal report by the Russian government estimated that the final cost would now reach $28 billion. </p>
<p>

In late 2006, Shell and its partners in Sakhalin Energy reached an agreement with Gazprom for the Kremlin controlled company to become the majority shareholder in the venture. This was described as a "Capitulation" by <newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

It was reported that some 5 per cent of the performance <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/522230.xml">
score-card</link> of about 200 executives in Shell’s exploration and production unit was tied to the company’s reserves replacement ratio. Shell's remuneration policy changed significantly between 1990 and 2005 with senior executives in all functions being substantially rewarded for achieving short-term performance related targets. When Shell's Sakhalin deal unravelled in 2006 there was comment that many of the senior managers who negotiated the deal in the first place had received bonuses based on the earnings expectations of that deal as they then applied. Although much less favourable terms were forced on Shell in the 2006 renegotiations it is not believed that any return of personal bonuses from these executives were requested.</p>

Fictitious trades</st>

<p>

In January 2006, Royal Dutch Shell Plc agreed to a $300,000 <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.cftc.gov/newsroom/enforcementpressreleases/2006/pr5150-06.html">
settlement</weblink> in respect of allegations that “two of its subsidiaries engaged in “fictitious” crude oil futures trades on the New York Mercantile Exchange.” Shell Trading U.S., located in Houston and London-based Shell International Trading and Shipping, agreed to pay $200,000 to settle a Commodity Futures Trading Commission case. Nigel Catterall, then head of the futures desk for Shell Trading U.S. agreed to pay $100,000. Bloomberg <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2006/01/05/bloomberg-news-shell-pays-300000-to-settle-case-houston-unit-one-of-two-accused-of-fictitious-deals/">
reported</weblink> that Catterall and Shell engaged in prearranged trades for oil futures at least five times between November 2003 and March 2004. The CFTC acknowledged that Shell had cooperated in the investigation. According to the Bloomberg story (one on many news reports on the case), a commission spokesman, Dennis Holden, would not comment on how the trading violations came to light.</p>

Bloomberg quoted a Shell spokeswoman Rebecca Elliott as stating in an e-mail <it>"In settling this civil case, the individuals neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the complaint"</it>, and <it>``Since this matter was between the CFTC and the individuals, it is not appropriate for us to comment further on the matter. </it></p>

Shell said it had wanted to protect its employees against possible attack. One of Schlickenrieder’s spying missions was to gather information about the movements of the motor vessel “Greenpeace” then operating in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/698.xml">

It was set up with the blessing of Sir David Spedding, the then chief of MI6”.</it> The article stated that Christopher James, the managing director of Hakluyt, had been head of the MI6 section that liaised with British firms. The Sunday Times article also revealed <it>“MPs believe the affair poses serious questions about the blurring of the divisions between the secret service, a private intelligence company and the interests of big companies. Hakluyt refutes claims by some in the intelligence community that it was started by MI6 officers to carry out “deniable” operations”</it>. Sir William Purves, a Shell director was Chairman of Hakluyt &amp; Company. A former Group Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, Sir Peter Holmes, was President of The Hakluyt Foundation, an associated organisation. </p>

Change of early retirement scheme in Ethiopia</st>

<p>

On November 20, 2007 <link>
Shell Ethiopia</link> <link>
Workers Union</link>, which claims to represent around 90% of the total Shell Ethiopia workforce, filed a law suit at the Federal First Instance Court in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/187749.xml">
Ethiopia</link></country>
 alleging that Shell has illegally changed its early <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../495/26495.xml">
retirement</link> policies in order to save money on lay-offs ahead of a possible closure of its operations in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>

The complain states that Shell scrapped its “Special Early Retirement Scheme”, which pays up to 55 months salary to employees who leave company service earlier than their retirement date and replaced it with a ‘Voluntary Severance Package’. The new package is alleged to reduce the amount of money to be paid to departing employees by up to 70pc while management members will get an additional payment ranging from 40pc to 100 pc.</p>
<p>

The <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2007/12/03/shell-employees-statement-of-claim-against-shell-ethiopia/">
Statement of Claim</weblink> points out that a few years ago Shell took over <name wordnetid="106333653" confidence="0.8">

 Ethiopia and accepted 34 employees, 13 of whom opted to avail themselves of the special early retirement scheme, thereby receiving 55 months of salary. </p>
<p>

On 2 December 2007, the Addis Fortune Newspaper in Ethiopia published an <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2007/12/03/shell-employees-statement-of-claim-against-shell-ethiopia/">

<p>

The case is scheduled for hearing on December 28, 2007.</p>
