<b>Acoustic homing</b> is a system which utilizes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../087/18994087.xml">
sound</link> to guide a moving object, such as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/31424.xml">
torpedo</link>. Acoustic homing can be either Passive or Active in nature. 
Using Passive, the system is designed to move either toward or away from a sound, and may also be designed to move only toward certain types of sounds to the exclusion of others.
While Active is a true <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/29438.xml">
Sonar</link>. The system emits a sound pulse, that reflects off objects and then back to the system. Where the system processes the echos to determine the proper response.

 Method </st>
<p>
 
An object can be equipped with two or more acoustic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../666/242666.xml">
transducers</link>, which function as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/45871.xml">
speakers</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/65886.xml">
microphones</link>.  If a transducer receives a sound louder than that received by the other transducer, the object turns in the transducer's direction. If the object is to manoeuvre in three-dimensional space, more than two transducers are needed. Typically, more than three transducers are used, and arrays of over 100 are not unknown. A large number of transducers allows for more accurate steering. </p>

Acoustic homing is useful in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/33496.xml">
weapons</link>, specifically <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/31424.xml">
torpedo</link>es.  Torpedoes can be made to move toward ships using acoustic homing.
