<b>BRS/Search</b> is a full-text database and information retrieval system. BRS/Search uses a fully-inverted indexing system to store, locate, and retrieve unstructured data. It was the search engine that in 1977 powered Bibliographic Retrieval Services (BRS) commercial operations with 20 databases (including the first national commercial availability of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/240749.xml">
MEDLINE</link>); it has changed ownership several times during its development and is currently sold as Livelink ECM Discovery Server by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Early development</st>
<p>

Development on what was to become BRS began as Biomedical Communications Network (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../905/4020905.xml">
BCN</link>) at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/97024.xml">
State University of New York</link></university>
, Albany (SUNY). BCN, which went online in 1968, provided on-line access to nine databases, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/240749.xml">
MEDLINE</link> and BIOSIS PREVIEWS, to large universities and medical schools primarily in the Northeast of the USA. State funding for the project was withdrawn in 1975, and Bibliographic Retrieval Services (BRS) was formed as a non-profit concern the following year. It was incorporated in May 1976 as a for-profit corporation with Ron Quake as president, Jan Egeland as vice president in charge of marketing and training, and Lloyd Palmer as vice president of systems. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

BRS commercial operations</st>
<p>

In December 1976, the First BRS User Meeting was held in Syracuse, N.Y. and by January 1977 BRS started commercial operations with 20 databases (including the first national commercial availability of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/240749.xml">
MEDLINE</link>) and 9 million records, using modified IBM STAIRS (STorage And Information Retrieval System) software, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../588/4618588.xml">
Telenet</link> for telecommunications, and timesharing mainframe computers of Carrier Corporation. In October 1980 BRS was sold by Egeland and Quake to Indian Head, Inc., a subsidiary of the Dutch company Thyssen-Bornemisza Corporation. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>

</celebrity>
 acquired BRS and the BRS/Search software, he announced the planned incorporation of the ORBIT Search Service and BRS Information Technologies and renamed the whole group Maxwell Online, Inc. At that time BRS Information Technologies were serving the medical and academic library marketplace with over 150 databases. Maxwell later bought the publishing company <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../012/1048012.xml">

</company>
 and put Maxwell Online under Macmillan. In the same year BRS/LINK (hypertext connection of databases; first application delivering full text) was announced.</p>
<p>

At the time of Robert Maxwell’s death in 1991, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">

</company>
 brought in Andrew Gregory to represent the company during the 2 years that Maxwell’s affairs were being settled and to prepare Maxwell Online to be able to sell the components. Maxwell Online shortly thereafter underwent yet another name change, this time to InfoPro Technologies.</p>

Dataware Technologies ownership of BRS/SEARCH</st>
<p>

Early in 1994, InfoPro Technologies, a subsidiary of MHC Inc. (holding company for Macmillan Inc.), the former Maxwell Online service, sold off all its subsidiaries. ORBIT Search Services went to the French-owned Questel, the dial-up BRS Search Services to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/7145951.xml">
CD Plus Technologies</link> (later to become OVID), and BRS Software Products (including BRS/SEARCH) to Dataware Technologies. Almost up to the end of InfoPro Technologies, BRS Software had been the fastest growing segment of the company. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>


<p>

At the 14th BRS North American Users Group Conference in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/34553.xml">
1999</link>, Dave Schubmehl of Dataware Technologies presented a paper in which he stated "The purpose of this presentation is to update BRS users on upcoming releases of BRS/Search, NetAnswer, and other Dataware products. BRS/Search 7.0 will include features specifically requested by customers, as well as other enhancements. Earlier this year, Dataware acquired Sovereign Hill Software, makers of InQuery. In light of that acquisition, and Dataware's other development projects, we'll look at Dataware's plans for all products, including BRS/Search and NetAnswer." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

Open Text acquisition of BRS/Search</st>
<p>

In 2001 BRS/Search was acquired by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/797262.xml">
Open Text</link> and became <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.opentext.com/2/sol-products/sol-pro-knowledge-management/pro-ll-discovery-server.htm">
LiveLink ECM Discovery Server</weblink> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

Open Text still supports both BRS/Search and NetAnswer. Active BRS/Search and NetAnswer installations include the public Web patent full-text database operated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office at <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/">
USPTO Web Patent Databases</weblink>.  BRS/Search and NetAnswer are also used in-house for searches performed by patent examiners and public patent searchers at the USPTO. </p>
<p>

The core BRS/Search technology in the Open Text portfolio was augmented with other capabilities through various acquisitions.  For example, Dataware's acquisition of Soveriegn-Hill brought InQuery, “a probabilistic information retrieval system using an inference network” <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/csinfo/newsletter/images/sigbits_spring97.pdf">
, which was developed by the University of Massachusetts Amherst Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval</weblink> out of the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/">
UMass CIIR</weblink> and into the marketplace.  A <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.opentext.com/2/sol-products/pro-allproducts/pro-rebranded-products-table.htm">
product re-branding table</weblink> shows the range of products, their old names and their new names.</p>
<p>

InQuery is a concept search engine that uses noun phrases, parts of speech and other co-occurrence relationships in overlapping passages of text rather than single term inverted indexes of single words in documents.</p>
<p>

Open Text's portfolio has grown to include Hummingbird Content Management and has always included BASIS</p>
