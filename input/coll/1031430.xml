<b>Tachypsychia</b> is a neurological condition that distorts the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/296639.xml">
perception of time</link>, usually induced by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/189037.xml">
physical exertion</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../887/87887.xml">
drug use</link>, or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../091/788091.xml">
traumatic event</link>. It is sometimes referred to by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/19501.xml">
martial arts</link> instructors and self defense experts as the <b>Tachy Psyche</b> effect. For someone affected by tachypsychia, time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts, objects appearing as moving in a speeding blur. It is believed that tachypsychia is induced by a combination of high levels of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/48548.xml">
dopamine</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../342/9903342.xml">
norepinephrine</link>, usually during periods of great physical stress and/or in violent confrontation.

 Physical Responses </st>
<p>

Also called the "fight or flight" response of the body to an event our mind considers life threatening, tachypsychia is believed to include numerous physical changes.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Adrenaline Response </st>
<p>

Upon being stimulated by fear or anger, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/471415.xml">
Adrenal medulla</link> may automatically produce the hormone epinephrine (aka <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/15548640.xml">
adrenaline</link>) directly into the blood stream. This can have various effects on various bodily systems, including:</p>
<p>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Increased heart rate and blood pressure. It is average for a person's pulse to raise to between 200 and 300 beats per minute (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../083/99083.xml">
bpm</link>). Increased <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/304942.xml">
heart rate</link> (above 250 bpm) can cause <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../319/168319.xml">

coma</link>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Dilation of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/308449.xml">
bronchial passages</link>, permitting higher absorption of oxygen.  </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Dilated pupils to allow more light to enter, and visual exclusion--tunnel vision--occurs, allowing greater focus but resulting in the loss of peripheral vision.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Release of glucose into the bloodstream, generating extra energy by raising the <link>

</list>
</p>

It is common for an individual to experience auditory exclusion or enhancement. It is also common for individuals to experience an increased pain tolerance, loss of color vision, short term memory loss, decreased fine motor skills, decreased communication skills, decreased coordination.</p>

 Psychological Response </st>
<p>

The most common experience during tachypsychia is the feeling that time has either increased or slowed down, brought on by the increased brain activity cause by epinephrine, or the severe decrease in brain activity caused by the "catecholamine washout" occurring after the event.</p>
<p>

It is common for an individual experiencing tachypsychia to have serious misinterpretations of their surrounding during the events, through a combination of their altered perception of time, as well as transient partial color blindness and tunnel vision. After the irregularly high levels of adrenaline consumed during sympathetic nervous system activation, an individual may display signs and symptoms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/82974.xml">
post-traumatic stress disorder</link>, and it is common for the person to display extreme emotional  lability and fatigue, regardless of their actual physical exertion.</p>
<p>

It is possible to manage the "adrenaline dump" still occurring after the event, and it is common for soldiers and martial artists to use tachypsychia in order to increase their performance during stressful situations. The ability to presage and then successfully exploit these natural phenomena is a distinguishing characteristic between the master and the skilled amateur in all inherently stressful professions.</p>
