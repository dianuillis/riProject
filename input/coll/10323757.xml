<b>Peace Oil</b> is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>, a UK-based registered charity, lead by Hilary Blume <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> which supports fund-raising by other charitable organisations. The charity describes the oil as "is produced in Israel by Jews, Arabs, Druze and Bedouin working together ...(it) encourages co-operation between communities".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> The project has been running since 2006 when the oil was launched at an <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.doingzionism.org.il/about_us/activity.asp?id=353">
Israel Expo Day</weblink> organised by the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.zionist.org.uk/new/cms/?id=23">
 Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland</weblink>, which promoted it as  a way "to support Israelâ€™s vibrant trade...to make a difference to the actual future of Israel."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><p>

According to the project's own web site, the oil is produced in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 working together. The olives are grown in the foothills of the <link>
Carmel Mountains</link> and pressed within hours of picking to produce a prize winning extra virgin <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>. The charity claims that its activities promote peace, though this has been challenged by campaigners, who <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.palestinecampaign.org/psc_news.asp?d=y&amp;id=202">
accuse it</weblink> of misleadingly attaching a "peace" label to an Israeli product which relies on continuing injustices suffered by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../267/23267.xml">
Palestinians</link>.</p>

Criticism</st>

<p>

Critics argue that Arab workers being employed to work for an Israeli company does no more to promote a peaceful resolution of the Israel/Palestine conflict than Black workers being employed in the production of South African gold, wine or diamonds did to end <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../527/2200527.xml">
Apartheid</link>. Under Israeli military occupation in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../209/33209.xml">
West Bank</link>, Palestinian olive groves are regularly destroyed and uprooted, farmers are denied access to their own land while checkpoints and discriminatory regulations routinely disrupt Palestinian economic life. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
Olive</link> trees and oil have been central to many disputes in the occupied territories with <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.american.edu/ted/ice/olive-tree.htm">
well documented accounts of the destruction of Palestinian olive groves</weblink> by both <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/873850.html">
Israeli settlers</weblink> and <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,473147,00.html">
the Israeli Army</weblink>. </p>
<p>

The Charities Advisory Trust has been asked <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> to explain which disadvantaged communities benefit from this enterprise and to justify their claims about the benefits of Peace Oil. It has been suggested that the oil is a distraction from <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.zaytoun.org/">
fairly traded oil being being produced by Palestinian farmers in the occupied territories</weblink>. </p>
<p>

An unrelated product, marketed in the USA as <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.peaceoil.net/">
Peace Oil</weblink>, is produced from Palestinian olives, and marketed in cooperation with Israeli and Palestinian <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/49147.xml">
Fair Trade</link> groups. According to supporters, "Unlike the London version, it is mostly olive oil from the West Bank where economic assistance is most needed".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
