This, and his well known controversial views on private funding of universities, led to Richard Davis in 2002 dubbing him the "doyen of economically rationalist vice-chancellors".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

 Limited (MUP), a private university established to work alongside with the University of Melbourne, so as to circumvent regulations strictly limiting the money-making educational ventures of Australian universities. The venture was a financial disaster and was widely criticised by academics, politicians and the media. To rescue MUP, the University Council borrowed $150 million from the National Australia Bank and agreed to provide additional money from its investment reserves. The present University of Melbourne VC, Glyn Davis, announced the closure of MUP on 7 May 2005, citing no need for such a venture now that market ventures are permitted in the public university sector, and there plans to integrate most of MUP back into the public university. Gilbert declined to comment on the actions of his successor. Ironically the building originally intended for MUP, and now a part of the public university, has been named the <it>Alan Gilbert Building</it>.</p>
<p>

Over the course of his tenure, Gilbert attracted the ire of both students and staff. For example, a staff strike took place on 22 October 1999 over lack of clarity over pay and conditions; administrative offices were occupied by students protesting introduction of fee-paying places in 1997, and again in April 2001, when there were 70 arrests.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

<it>Off Course: From Public Place to Market Place at Melbourne University</it>, claims that Professor Gilbert left the university a "quasi-privatised institution in the corporate mould".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

<p>

Gilbert's plans for the new university are ambitious:</p>
<p>

Our aim is to make the University of Manchester one of the top 25 research-led universities in the world. It will be an educational and research powerhouse that is at home in England's North-West and committed to regional as well as national and international agendas. Without seeking to emulate the social cachet of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/22490.xml">
Oxbridge</link> or America's <conference wordnetid="108308497" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/14975.xml">
Ivy League</link></conference>
, it will take its place confidently alongside those virtuoso institutions in its research capability and performance, in the quality of the students and staff that it attracts and in the reputation for scholarly excellence that it secures.</p>
<p>

According to the university's strategic plan<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> (akin to his earlier <it>Melbourne Agenda</it> (2002)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>) the University aims to have five <award wordnetid="106696483" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/21201.xml">
Nobel Laureates</link></award>
 on its staff by 2015, at least two of whom will have full-time appointments, and three of which it is intended to secure by 2007. (The University of Melbourne now has four Nobel winners working part-time on campus.)</p>
<p>

Gilbert continues: 
By investing heavily in world class people and offering them state-of-the-art facilities, we aim to make the University of Manchester a destination of preference for many of the best students, teachers, researchers and scholars in the world. More than anything else, the success of the Manchester 2015 Agenda will be driven by the impact of internationally pre-eminent researchers and research clusters on the scholarly culture of the University generally.</p>
<p>

Central to <it>Project Unity</it>, the name given to the plan to merge, was the idea of extending the <it>Golden triangle</it> of <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../797/31797.xml">

 and the London universities <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 to a <it>Golden Quadrilateral</it>.</p>
<p>

Gilbert's address to the university during the inauguration ceremony in Whitworth Hall on 22 October 2004 made it very clear that he believed the plan was achievable and listed five key elements in the transition from <it><book wordnetid="106410904" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../396/1553396.xml">
Good to Great</link></book>
</it>, quoting the book of that title by Jim Collins.</p>
<p>

One of the intentions of Gilbert's 2015 agenda was an improvement in Manchester's position in international league tables. In 2004 the University ranked 78th in the Shanghai Jiao Tong <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/959184.xml">
Academic Ranking of World Universities</link>, this has improved steadily 2005 53rd, 2006 50th, 2007 48th, 2008 40th. This ranking measures indicators such as Nobel Prize winners and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/12688251.xml">
highly cited authors</link> 154 are listed on ISI HighlyCited.com, for Manchester,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> and has improved partly as a result of the appointment of such people. Glbert has been quoted in an interview<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> as saying that "there is only one ranking that matters – the world ranking of global universities produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University".</p>
<p>

Up to 2007 £388.5m had been spent on new buildings,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> funded in part by government grants and sale of other assets. However, Gilbert announced that due to increases in salary costs, energy bills and lower than expected revenue the University was about £30m (5% of its annual turnover) in deficit. Gilbert announced plans for 400 redundancies<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> and he and the university management was criticised by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../408/3304408.xml">
University and College Union</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> However Gilbert has as of 2007 honoured his pledge to achieve the staff reductions without compulsory redundancies, and in October 2007 announced that the university's budget had been brought in to "a modest surplus" as a result mainly of a voluntary redundancy scheme.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>
<p>

In 2008 Gilbert announced a "root-and-branch review" of Manchester's teaching quality that the University's 'strategy to join the world's elite universities will be worthless unless staff can be 're-invented' to interact more with students".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
