Thomas Ryan</link>, CVS Caremark's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/52234.xml">

The "pharmacy" part of the CVS store name comes from the chain's days as a regional Northeastern U.S. chain.  CVS operated many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/47419.xml">

CVS had previously operated stores in southern California and completely withdrew from the market in 1993. CVS sold virtually all of the locations to Sav-on Drugs then owner American Stores Company which operated the drug store division as American Drug Stores. Many of the stores in Southern California that CVS has acquired were formerly operated by CVS and most recently have operated as Sav-on Express stores. The Express name was used by Sav-on to help customers identify those stores that did not carry all lines of merchandise as compared to the larger traditional Sav-on Drugs location, hence the name Sav-on Express. As a result of the acquisition, the chain now operates over 6,200 stores in 43 states and the District of Columbia.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>

-based marketing company, <link>
Elensys</link>. According to the Post, Elensys received information on specific prescription drugs that individual CVS customers had purchased and used this information to send targeted direct mailings urging customers to renew prescriptions and promoting other products in which they might be interested. CVS and Elensys argued that there were no privacy issues because Elensys was acting solely as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/789973.xml">
contractor</link> to CVS, and because the purpose of the mailings was to educate consumers. CVS claimed that it never shared customers' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/1616002.xml">
medical histories</link> with Elensys (despite the Washington Post's indirect evidence that they had). George D. Lundberg, editor of the <it><periodical wordnetid="106593296" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Deceptive Business Practices</st>

In February 2008, CVS Caremark settled a large civil lawsuit for deceptive business practices. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../394/4423394.xml">
Kaiser Family Foundation</link> reported:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>
<p>

CVS Caremark has agreed to a a $38.5 million settlement in a multi-state civil deceptive-practices lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager Caremark filed by 28 attorneys general, the <it><newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/60961.xml">

</it> reports.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> The attorneys general, led by Lisa Madigan (D) of Illinois and Douglas Ganslar (D) of Maryland, allege that Caremark "engaged in deceptive business practices" by informing physicians that patients or health plans could save money if patients were switched to certain brand-name prescription drugs (Miller, <it>Chicago Tribune</it>, 2/14).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

However, the switch often saved patients and health plans only small amounts or increased their costs, while increasing Caremark's profits, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal (D) said (Levick, <it><link>
Hartford Courant</link></it>, 2/15).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett (R) said the PBM kept discounts and rebates that should have been passed on to employers and patients (Levy, <it><commercial_enterprise wordnetid="108065093" confidence="0.8">

</it>, 2/14).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> In addition, Caremark did not "adequately inform doctors" of the full financial effect of the switch and did not disclose that the switch would increase Caremark's profits, the lawsuit alleges (<it>Chicago Tribune</it>, 2/14).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

...The settlement prohibits Caremark from requesting prescription drug switches in certain cases, such as when the cost to the patient would be higher with the new prescription drug; when the original prescription drug's patent will expire within six months; and when patients were switched from a similar prescription drug within the previous two years (<it>Hartford Courant</it>, 2/15).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Patients also have the ability to decline a switch from the prescribed treatment to the prescription offered by the pharmacy under the settlement, Madigan said (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/1974777.xml">
