<p>

The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) aims to bring standards of some of the programmes offered in technical institute on par with programmes offered in instituitions offered across USA and Europe, by introducing a quality auditing system and establishing datum for measuring the quality and excellence in engineering education. The NBA will periodically conduct evaluation of technical institutions and Programs on the basis of guidelines, norms and standards.</p>
<p>

The accreditation exercise is designed to be rigorous with several inputs such as quality of teaching, level of research, faculty expertise, evaluation of teachers, standard of infrastructure available in the campus, such as hostel facility, library, medical facility etc. These are taken into consideration in order to help the visiting accreditation team of txperts to have holistic approach and arrive at a rational evaluation.</p>
<p>

Realising the value of accreditation, several institutions have volunteered to go through the rigorous process of audit, the uniqueness of the process is that the duration for which any program oe institutions will have to maintain the quality and standard, if they wish to retain the accredited standard.</p>
