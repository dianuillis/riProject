By comparison, the record of other operators is good. Shell has faced campaigning activity on its safety record and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/361308.xml">
Health and Safety</link> working practices, particularly in relation to its North Sea platforms, following the tragic death of only two offshore workers after a gas leak on its Brent Bravo platform on 11 September 2003. Representations made by offshore unions and by Bill Campbell, the retired HSE Group Auditor of Shell International, have attracted the attention of the news media resulting in numerous articles being published on the subject. Shell has consistently maintained following the Brent Bravo accident, that it gives first priority to the safety of offshore workers and all Shell employees.</p>

 had complained that the Brent Bravo platform still had <it>“leaks, dangerous stairs, and lifts left broken for six months”.</it> The article went on to say that in the summer of 2006, Shell had said that it was in the middle of a $1bn (£515m) programme to upgrade the platforms, claiming: <it>"Safety is and will remain our first priority."</it> The Guardian report drew attention to the HSE website which said that Shell was <it>“issued with 10 improvement notices during 2006”</it> and also pointed out that <it>“Notices are served where the HSE considers a company is operating unlawfully with unacceptable risks”.</it> The article also revealed that <it>“Last year, Shell was embarrassed when Bill Campbell, one of its senior safety consultants, claimed the company was operating a weak safety regime and said some employees had been falsifying documents.

 explosion in 2005. The Wall Street Journal highlighted the fact that “<it>Royal Dutch Shell was a far more dangerous company to work for in the past two years”</it> and also pointed out that according to an annual report filed by Shell with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../097/55097.xml">
United States Securities and Exchange Commission</link> on 14 March 2007, 37 Shell employees and contractors died in 2006, compared with just 7 BP employees. In the same filing, Shell CEO <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../007/3934007.xml">
Jeroen van der Veer</link></person>
 was quoted as stating: <it>“Our safety performance in 2006 was mixed”</it> and “<it>We have responded by reinforcing our safety focus through a dedicated global safety function that will improve compliance with standards and procedures worldwide.”</it></p>
<p>

On 20 March 2007, The Wall Street Journal published an “Energy Blog” article on its website under the headline <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://blogs.wsj.com/energy/2007/03/20/ft-compares-deaths-at-oil-majors/">
<it>“Shell’s Record Worse Than BP’s”.</it></weblink> <it> The article cited a comment in a Wall Street Journal “Energy Roundup” report which said </it>“...though BP has been chastised for its safety record in the past two years, it has not lost as many employees and contractors to death as rival Royal Dutch Shell, which employs roughly the same number of people”.<it> The article also referred to a <newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/136566.xml">
Financial Times</link></newspaper>
 story published on 20 March 2007 under the headline “Safety record is put in the spotlight” which had expanded the Shell/BP comparison to include several oil majors over more years. It quoted from the FT story: “</it>Since 2003, the first year of the Times’s study, Shell has had more global employee and contractor deaths than the other four”.<it> Shell has appointed a global vice-president for health, safety and environment to tackle safety problems and has pointed out that it operates in the dangerous Niger Delta, where militant attacks accounted for 9 of its fatalities in 2006. An update has subsequently been added to the Wall Street Journal article explaining why the headline has changed to “</it>FT Data: Is Shell’s Record Worse Than BP’s?<it> It explains </it>“While it may be true Shell has had more deaths than BP in at least the past couple of years (which we’ve confirmed in their annual reports), it’s worth noting that these tallies are not necessarily the best measure of a company’s safety record, as they do not account for the number of accidents per worker.”</p>

, who is retiring in 2009. An <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2044985,00.html">
article</weblink> published by The Guardian on 29 March 2007, under the headline “Van der Veer - a safe pair of hands?” stated in reference to Van der Veer, <it>“The one big area where he has fallen down is safety”.</it> It went on to remind readers that the newspaper had revealed a few weeks earlier that Shell had <it>“continued to receive warnings from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/361308.xml">
Health and Safety Executive</link> that it is acting illegally with regard to safety in the North Sea”. </it> The article concluded that <it>“Mr van der Veer needs to bring a halt to this, and so does exploration and production boss Malcolm Brinded if he wants to stand any chance of taking over the top job”.</it> Another article published by the Guardian on the same day, 29 March 2007, under the headline <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2044948,00.html">
“Shell chief to stay an extra year beyond company retirement age”,</weblink> also contained commentary linking the succession with safety issues. It stated: <it>”There will be a struggle to replace Mr van der Veer among the three managing directors: Malcolm Brinded, head of exploration, Linda Cook at gas and power, and finance director Peter Voser. Mr Brinded, 54, has been seen as a frontrunner but might be vulnerable over North Sea safety after revelations an internal audit found violations of safety procedures and the alleged falsification of compliance documents. Shell denied the latter charge".</it></p>

The Brent Bravo accident and aftermath</st>

<p>

The only fatal accident for which there is detailed information available is for the Brent Bravo North Sea platform tragedy. Brent Bravo, located about 180 miles east of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/28916.xml">
Shetland Isles</link>, is one of four oil production and storage platforms in the UK northern sector of the North Sea that make up the Brent field. 
On 11 September 2003, two platform workers, Sean McCue, 22, of Kennoway in Fife, and Keith Moncrieff, 45, of Invergowrie, Tayside, lost their lives after a sudden escape of gas in a platform leg where they were working. Sixty non-essential staff were evacuated from the platform by helicopter after the gas was detected. According to a BBC News <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3102312.stm">
report</weblink> published the following day, Shell Expro Managing Director Tom Botts said that the emergency response system immediately shut down the platform. Jake Molloy, the leader of the offshore union Offshore Industry Liaison Committee -"OILC", was quoted as saying that unions had already complained to the HSE about a backlog of maintenance and staffing issues in the Brent Field, particularly on the Brent Bravo platform. The article revealed that the HSE were investigating the accident. 
On 9 February 2005, a BBC News <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4251673.stm">
report</weblink> revealed that Shell had been charged following the deaths of the two offshore workers.
On 31 March 2005, The Scotsman newspaper <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=339952005">
reported</weblink> that Shell had admitted at Stonehaven Sheriff Court breaching three health and safety charges in connection with the deaths.</p>

 under the headline: <it>“Unions call for manslaughter law after Shell deaths inquiry”</it>. It reported that <it>“The six-month investigation into the deaths on Brent Bravo in September 2003 concluded that the accident could have been avoided if Shell had done a proper repair of a pipe”. </it> It went on to say <it>“The victims, Keith Moncrieff and Sean McCue, died from a huge gas escape from an illegal repair to a corroded pipe when they descended into the concrete leg of the platform to make an inspection”.</it>  Shell was said to have accepted the inquiry findings. 
The Times article pointed out that Bill Campbell, a former Shell engineer, had come forward with details of a platform safety maintenance review carried in 1999 on the Brent Bravo platform. It said that Campbell’s audit team found <it>“widespread violations of safety procedures and alleged falsification of records”.</it> The article revealed that <it>“Mr Campbell, who retired from Shell in 2002, believes that the Brent Bravo deaths could have been prevented had the company responded adequately to his finding that platform maintenance was being delayed to sustain oil and gas output. He tried to put his evidence to the inquiry, but the presiding sheriff declined to admit it on the ground that it was beyond the inquiry’s scope”. </it> Shell was quoted as accepting the 1999 audit’s findings, saying that it responded with improvements. However Shell insisted that there was no verifiable evidence of falsification by platform management as Campbell had alleged.</p>

Allegations made by Bill Campbell, former North Sea OIM &amp; Group Auditor of Shell International</st>

<p>

In June and July 2006, over a dozen articles were published by the news media revealing serious allegations by Bill Campbell, a former Shell International Group Auditor, whose name, as a result, is now inextricably linked with the Brent Bravo story.  </p>
<p>

Campbell’s allegations were the subject of a programme broadcast by BBC Scotland's investigative current affairs BBC 1 TV programme <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2902173.stm">
Frontline Scotland</weblink> in a feature entitled: <it>“The Human Price of Oil”.</it> An article relating to the programme was published by BBC News under the headline <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5077886.stm">
“Shell ignored accident warning”</weblink>, one of a number of BBC news reports on the subject. 
The Guardian newspaper published three articles, the first with the headline <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,1804143,00.html">
“Shell accused over oil rig safety”;</weblink> the second entitled <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1809318,00.html">
“Call for inquiry into oil rig safety regulator</weblink> and the third <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1830949,00.html">
“Shell confesses to poor North Sea safety record and pledges reform”</weblink>
A <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.shellnews.net/2007/upstream-online-brent-bravo-articles.html">
series of articles</weblink> was also published by <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.upstreamonline.com/">
Upstream Online</weblink> a respected weekly petroleum industry publication which also operates a related petroleum news website.</p>
<p>

One of the most astonishing allegations was that <it>"top directors of Shell Expro in Aberdeen, the UK arm of the Anglo-Dutch group, allegedly sanctioned a policy widely known as Touch Fuck All (TFA) whereby offshore installation managers were told to stop any work with the potential to cause unplanned shutdowns"</it>. The following paragraph is also taken from the same article by UpstreamOnline entitled <it>"Shell in the safety firing line".</it></p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

"The allegations levelled by Campbell against Malcolm Brinded, Shell’s group chief executive for global E&amp;P, who was in charge of the UK business at the time, and his oil director Chris Finlayson, who is now country president of Shell Russia, claim the two men ran an operation where production took priority over safety concerns". 
</indent>

Shell was quoted as rejecting Campbell's charges. Shell said <it>"The allegation regarding operating with high-risk levels is untrue and we absolutely refute this. Safety is and will remain our first priority offshore"</it>.</p>

Health and Safety Executive partially uphold claims about Shell safety</st>

On 8 November 2007, BBC News <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/7084534.stm">
reported</weblink> that <it>“The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has partially upheld claims that Shell was not doing enough to ensure safety offshore” and that </it>Shell has taken action to address the matters<it>. </it> The article said that the offshore unions Unite Amicus and OILC had asked the HSE to investigate claims from their members which “focused” on manning levels and the attitude of platform management. The article went on to say: <it>“The investigation concluded that aspects of the complaint were justified”. </it> Graham Tran, an official of the Unite Amicus Union was quoted as saying he believed Shell should leave the North Sea as it has “no credibility”.

The article went on to say: <it>“Shell, which earned £1.5m an hour last year, has been through a torrid time over North Sea safety since one of its own most experienced inspectors, Bill Campbell, blew the whistle on his employer claiming that safety procedures were being repeatedly ignored on some platforms.”</it> Shell said it would not comment <it>“in-depth”</it> on the HSE statement saying that an investigation was continuing.

Jake Molloy, the general secretary of the OILC Union claimed it was an admission by Shell that standards on the platforms were poor. He called on the company to put some of its record profits into improving things. Shell said in response: "<it>Safety is our top priority. Two years ago Shell started a $1.2bn asset integrity programme. It is approximately 70 per cent complete.”</it> Shell is further quoted as saying <it>"A number of allegations have been made by unions and staff regarding safety since an announcement on June 14 2007 of plans to offer these assets to potential purchasers. These allegations have been investigated by the HSE and a number of issues have been worked on.

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/339530.xml">
refinery</link>”</it> and said that Shell had pleaded guilty on 22 February 2008 at Chester Crown Court to charges that for several years in the run up to the incident in May 2003, it had failed to comply with regulations covering control of major accident hazards.  The article stated: <it>“The energy company has admitted blame for allowing a safety pipe to corrode so badly that it split wide open.”</it> Although no-one was injured Judge Roger Dutton was advised that <it>“if it had exploded, there would have been multiple casualties.”</it> Simon Parrington, prosecuting for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/361308.xml">
Health and Safety Executive</link> was quoted as saying: <it>“The escape of gas was caused by Shell’s failure to properly inspect and maintain the pipe. The issue we are concerned with is the toxicity of the gas. It is lethal and could have caused many fatalities.”</it> Mr Parrington stated in court that <it>“if, by chance, the jet of toxic gas leaked from the bottom instead of the top of the pipe, it could have sparked a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of key sections of the plant”.</it> He said that the six-inch pipe in question had been neglected for years. Mr Parrington made the point: <it>“This is a company which has posted £13.7bn in profits and it has huge resources at its disposal.”</it> Graham Wells, acting for the defendant Shell UK, disputed the exact cause of the corrosion inside the pipe but conceded: “<it>The defendant accepts this was a serious matter. The process is one which uses hazardous chemicals and the escape happened because the pipe was corroded. Pipes should not corrode and this is the basis of the guilty plea.”</it> Yuri Sebregts, the General Manager of the Stanlow plant, was quoted as saying: <it>“We responded quickly after the event and since then we have co-operated fully with the HSE in their investigation. Changes have been made to the plant and procedures to ensure the problem will not re-occur.”</it> The Judge adjourned the hearing for sentencing at a later date.

Shell safety critical issues raised in March 2008</st>

UpstreamOnline</link> published an article under the headline: <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.shellnews.net/images/Upstreamonline-pressure-rises-on-shell-14march08.html">
“Pressure rises on Shell”.</weblink> The article by Christopher Hopson said that Shell is still <it>“feeing the heat”</it> from its Brent Bravo safety record and reported <it>“Shell is under mounting pressure to explain its poor North Sea safety record after fresh revelations showed it has been by far the worst performer in the play, receiving six out of a total of 18 legal notices issued by the UK’s Health&amp;Safety Executive (HSE) over a two-and-a-half year period.”</it> The article revealed that Shell had received more notices than any other operator working in the UK North Sea. The disclosures emerged after a Channel 4 TV News report about serious safety failings on Brent Bravo following an inspection of the platform carried out by the HSE in 2005. Shell was quoted as saying: <it>“On our platforms we employ systems under which our people inspect and maintain safety critical equipment. Our goal is 100% compliance on planned corrective safety critical maintenance on all our platforms.”</it></p>

“Lifeboats trouble at Brent field”</weblink> also published on 14 March 2008, UpstreamOnline revealed <it>“SHELL’s safety record on its Brent Bravo platform in the UK Northern North Sea is once again under scrutiny after the discovery of technical problems with two lifeboats on the installation that resulted in both of them being removed from service.”</it> Jake Molloy, general secretary of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee was quoted in the article by Christopher Hopson as claiming <it>“If they had loaded up this particular lifeboat, the chances are it could have been launched into the sea in an uncontrolled fashion which would have caused death or injury as it was held in place by corrosion and not by the designed system”.</it> The article said that problems had been found with a second lifeboat on the Brent Bravo platform. It also reported that a lifeboat had launched itself into the sea from Shell’s Tern platform because the brakes and clutches were “dysfunctional” and had damaged the launch mechanism off the platform. Shell confirmed problems had been discovered with two lifeboats on Brent Bravo during <it>“routine maintenance”.</it> Shell was quoted as stating that it viewed the matter seriously and had <it>“mobilised an investigation team on the platform”.</it></p>
