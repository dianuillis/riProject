In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/12401.xml">
graph theory</link>, the <b>Erdős-Rényi model</b>, named for <link>
Paul Erdős</link> and <link>
Alfréd Rényi</link>, is either of two models for generating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../477/358477.xml">
random graph</link>s, including one that sets an edge between each pair of nodes with equal probability, <link>
 independently</link> of the other edges.   It can be used in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/173525.xml">
probabilistic method</link> to prove the existence of graphs satisfying various properties, or to provide a rigorous definition of what it means for a property to hold for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/1309.xml">
almost all</link> graphs.

<p>

There are two closely related variants of the Erdős-Rényi random graph model.</p>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

In the <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>M</it>) model a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs which have <it>n</it> nodes and <it>M</it> edges.  For example, in the <it>G</it>(<it>3</it>,<it>2</it>) model, each of the three possible graphs on three vertices and two edges are included with probability 1/3.  </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

In the <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) model, a graph is thought to be constructed by connecting nodes randomly. Each edge is included in the graph with probability <it>p</it>, with the presence or absence of any two distinct edges in the graph being independent.  Equivalently, all graphs with <it>n</it> nodes and <it>M</it> edges have equal probability of <math>p^M (1-p)^{{n \choose 2}-M}</math>. The parameter <it>p</it> in this model can be thought of as a weighting function; as <it>p</it> increases from <it>0</it> to <it>1</it>, the model becomes more and more likely to include graphs with more edges and less and less likely to include graphs with fewer edges.  In particular, the case <it>p</it> = 0.5 corresponds to the case where all <math>2^\tbinom{n}{2}</math> graphs on <it>n</it> vertices are chosen with equal probability.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The behavior of random graphs are often studied in the case where <it>n</it>, the number of vertices, tends to infinity.  Although <it>p</it> and <it>M</it> can be fixed in this case, they can also be functions depending on <it>n</it>.  For example, the statement "almost every graph in <math>G(n, \tfrac{2 \ln n}{n})</math> is connected" means "as <it>n</it> tends to infinity, the probability that a graph on <it>n</it> vertices with edge probability <math>\tfrac{2 \ln n}{n}</math> is connected tends to 1".</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Comparison between the two models</st>
<p>

The expected number of edges in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) is <math>\tbinom{n}{2}p</math>, and by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../055/157055.xml">
law of large numbers</link> any graph in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) will almost surely have approximately this many edges (provided the expected number of edges tends to infinity).  Therefore a rough heuristic is that if <math>pn^2</math> tends to infinity, then <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) should behave similarly to <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>M</it>) with <math>M=\tbinom{n}{2} p</math> as <it>n</it> increases.  </p>
<p>

For many graph properties, this is the case.  If <it>P</it> is any graph property which is <link>
 Monotone</link> with respect to the subgraph ordering (meaning that if <it>A</it> is a subgraph of <it>B</it> and <it>A</it> satisfies <it>P</it>, then <it>B</it> will satisfy <it>P</it> as well), then the statements " <it>P</it> holds for almost all graphs in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) " and "<it>P</it> holds for almost all graphs in <math> G(n, \tbinom{n}{2} p) </math> are equivalent (provided <math>np^2</math> tends to infinity).  For example, this holds if <it>P</it> is the property of being <link>
 connected</link>, or if <it>P</it> is the property of containing a <link>
 Hamiltonian cycle</link>.  However, this will not necessarily hold for non-monotone properties (e.g. the property of having an even number of edges).</p>
<p>

In practice, the <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) model is the one more commonly used today, in part due to the ease of analysis allowed by the independence of the edges.</p>

 Properties of <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>)</st>
<p>

As mentioned above, a graph from <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) has on average <math>\tbinom{n}{2} p</math> edges. The distribution of the degree of any particular vertex is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../876/3876.xml">
 binomial</link>: </p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

 <math>P(\operatorname{deg}(v) = k) = {n-1\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-1-k},</math>
</indent>

where <it>n</it> is the total number of vertices in the graph.</p>
<p>

In a 1960 paper, Erdős and Rényi described the behavior of <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) very precisely for various values of <it>p</it>.  Their results included that:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

If <math>np &amp;lt; 1 </math>, then a graph in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) will almost surely have no connected components of size larger than <math>O(\log n)</math></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

If <math>np=1 </math>, then a graph in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>p</it>) will almost surely have largest component whose size is of order <math>n^{2/3}</math></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

If <math>np </math> tends to a constant <it>c</it> &amp;gt; 1, then a graph in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) will almost surely have a unique "giant" component containing a positive fraction of the vertices.  No other component will contain more than <math>O(\log n)</math> vertices.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

If <math>p&amp;lt;\tfrac{(1-\epsilon)\ln n}{n}</math>, then a graph in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) will almost surely not be connected.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

If <math>p&amp;gt;\tfrac{(1+\epsilon) \ln n}{n}</math>, then a graph in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) will almost surely be connected.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Thus <math> \tfrac{\ln n}{n}</math> is a <link>
 sharp threshold</link> for the connectivity of <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>).</p>
<p>

Other properties of the graph can be described almost precisely as <it>n</it> tends to infinity.  For example</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

There is a <it>k</it>(<it>n</it>) (approximately equal to <math>2 \log_2 n</math>) such that the largest <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../466/524466.xml">
 clique</link> in <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, 0.5) is almost surely either <it>k</it>(<it>n</it>) or <it>k</it>(<it>n</it>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.    </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Thus even though finding the size of the largest clique in a graph is <class wordnetid="107997703" confidence="0.8">
<collection wordnetid="107951464" confidence="0.8">
<group wordnetid="100031264" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../466/39466.xml">
NP-complete</link></group>
</collection>
</class>
, the size of the largest clique in a "typical" graph (according to this model) is very well understood.</p>

Weaknesses</st>
<p>

Both of the two major assumptions of the <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) model (that edges are independent and that each edge is equally likely) may be unrealistic in modeling real situations.  In particular, an Erdős-Rényi graph will likely not be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/227155.xml">
scale-free</link> like many real networks.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/8337525.xml">
Watts and Strogatz model</link> attempts to correct this limitation.</p>

 History </st>

<p>

The <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>p</it>) model was first introduced by <link>
Edgar Gilbert</link> in a 1959 paper which studied the connectivity threshold mentioned above.  The <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>, <it>M</it>) model was introduced by Erdős and Rényi in their 1959 paper.  As with Gilbert, their first investigations were as to the connectivity of <it>G</it>(<it>n</it>,<it>M</it>), with the more detailed analysis following in 1960.</p>
