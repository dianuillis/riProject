<b>magnussoft ZETA</b>, previously <b>yellowTAB ZETA</b>, was an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> formerly developed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/1049651.xml">
yellowTAB</link> of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/11867.xml">
Germany</link></country>
 based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../801/4801.xml">
BeOS</link> operating system developed by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/251716.xml">
Be Inc.</link></company>
; because of yellowTAB's insolvency, ZETA was later being developed by an independent team of which little was known, and distributed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/6944847.xml">
magnussoft</link>. As of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/11311.xml">
February 28</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">
2007</link> the current version of ZETA is 1.5. On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/19347.xml">
March 28</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">
2007</link>, magnussoft announced that it has discontinued funding the development of ZETA by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../818/19818.xml">
March 16</link>, because the sales figures had fallen far short of the company's expectations, so that the project was no longer economically viable.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> A few days later, the company also stopped the distribution of ZETA in reaction to allegations that ZETA constituted a pirated copy of BeOS.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

ZETA was an effort to bring BeOS up to date, adding support for newer hardware, and features that had been introduced in other operating systems in the years since Be Incorporated ceased development in 2001. Among the new features were <link>
USB 2.0</link> support, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../151/174151.xml">
SATA</link> support, <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/29198.xml">
samba</link></software>
 support, a new media player, and enhanced localization of system components. Unlike <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../281/554281.xml">
Haiku</link></O>
 and other open source efforts to recreate some or all of BeOS's functionality from scratch, ZETA was based on the actual BeOS code base, and it is closed source.</p>
<p>

ZETA contributed to an increase in activity in the BeOS commercial software market, with a number of new products for both ZETA and the earlier BeOS being released.</p>
<p>

However, some critics point to a list of goals for the first release that do not appear to have been met (including <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">
<request wordnetid="106513366" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../881/15881.xml">
Java</link></request>
</message>
 1.4.2 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/168701.xml">
ODBC</link> support). Other reviewers point to bugs that still exist from BeOS, and question whether yellowTAB has the complete access to the source code they would need to make significant updates.</p>
<p>

The system also came under heavy criticism from BeOS developers for undocumented changes in the system messaging system. These changes could break compilation of code, and in some cases (most notably <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../225/20225.xml">
Mozilla</link>), break the actual application if any code optimizations are applied, resulting in much slower builds.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

Additional controversy has come from their bundling of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/3188361.xml">
Gobe Productive</link> in a licensing deal which <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/3188361.xml">
Gobe</link> had disputed.</p>
<p>

YellowTAB promoted ZETA mainly in the German market, where it used to be sold through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/303043.xml">
infomercial</link>s and on <system wordnetid="108435388" confidence="0.8">

The operating system ZETA was published before the appearance of the final version 1,0 as Release Candidates (RC). The release began with RC1, and the following RC2 showed clear development progress since BeOS R5 was on the market.
Among other things new hardware was supported, as well as USB devices. Starting from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../865/15865.xml">

Based on the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://zeta-os.com/cms/custom/zeta/indexe.php">
product information from magnussoft</weblink>, ZETA 1.21 a minor upgrade to ZETA 1.2. This is also the first version of the product to be labeled "magnussoft ZETA" and to be sold by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/6944847.xml">

According to an <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=15802">
interview with Rene Weinert of magnussoft</weblink>, magnussoft owns only the rights to sell ZETA, and development is being done by an independent developing team which includes Mr. Bernd Korz (the former CEO of the now bankrupt yellowTAB). This confirms that, contrary to the widespread belief, prior to this interview, ZETA is not being developed by magnussoft, but by an independent development team, of which little is known so far.</p>

Criticism</st>

<p>

ZETA and yellowTAB have been surrounded by controversy. Critics of yellowTAB questioned for a long time the legality of ZETA, and whether yellowTAB had legal access to the sources of BeOS;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> it is now known that yellowTAB could not have developed ZETA to the extent that they did without access to the source code, but doubts remain as to whether yellowTAB actually had legal access to the code or not.</p>
<p>

Furthermore, critics did not see ZETA as real advancement of BeOS, but rather as an unfinished and buggy operating system loaded with third party applications that were either obsolete, unsupported, or non-functional. This was particularly true in the initial releases of ZETA, and it was in clear conflict with the attention to detail that BeOS used to stand for, disappointing the BeOS community who at one point had high expectations for ZETA. While yellowTAB did clean up the selection of bundled applications in following versions, ZETA remains somewhat unstable when compared to other modern desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>

But perhaps the most criticized practice by yellowTAB was its tendency to make claims that turned out to be either half truths or vague enough that they could not be confirmed. Not only did yellowTAB announce certain developments that never materialized (such as Java, and ODBC among others), but it would also support certain capabilities beyond what ZETA was actually capable of (e.g., compatibility with MS Office). According to sources close to yellowTAB, this is believed to have lead to a high return rate from customers that bought ZETA from the German <system wordnetid="108435388" confidence="0.8">

 TV shopping channel, and the reason for which RTL eventually stopped selling the product.</p>
<p>

Another issue that has been brought up by the BeOS community is the fact that magnussoft has never released any free-of-charge versions of Zeta. Be Inc. used to offer BeOS Personal Edition free of charge, which was of great help to those who wanted to test BeOS. The lack of a trial version saw Zeta seriously confined to the limits of the older BeOS community. Nevertheless, there is a Students Edition which can be obtained, at the price of 49 Euro, from <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.zeta-os.com">
Zeta-OS.com</weblink>.</p>

 Zeta had no legal rights to distribute the BeOS software, much less open source any of it, as the rumours had it.[...]The main reason that there hasn't been a public statement previously is that dealing with this matter legally, in Germany, is an expensive undertaking and--given the apparently small amount of funding behind Zeta in its various incarnations--we'd only be in a position to spend significant money and legal time to make a point.[...]We have sent "cease and desist" letters to YellowTab on a number of occasions, which have been uniformly ignored. If Herr Korz feels that he holds a legitimate license to the BeOS code he's been using, we're completely unaware of it, and I'd be fascinated to see him produce any substantiation for that claim.</col>
