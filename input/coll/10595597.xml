An <b>identity score</b> is a system for tagging and verifying the legitimacy of an individual’s public <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../843/375843.xml">
identity</link>. Identity scores are increasingly being adopted as a means to prevent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/58790.xml">
fraud</link> in business and as a tool to verify and correct <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../819/2539819.xml">
public records</link>. </p>
<p>

Identity scores incorporate a broad set of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../818/7818.xml">
consumer</link> data that gauges a person’s legitimacy.  Identity score components can include (but are not limited to) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/9518556.xml">

Business and consumer identity scores</st>

<p>

Identity scoring was originally developed for use by financial services firms, to measure the fraud risk for new customers opening accounts. Typical external credit and fraud checks often fail to detect erroneous background information.  </p>
<p>

Identity scoring is also being tested as a means for financial institutions to comply with criminal investigations and antiterrorism measures such as the <transgression wordnetid="100745005" confidence="0.8">

Public records, private records, and credit records in identity scores</st>

<p>

Identity scores are built from collecting information from a variety of sources and analyzing discernible patterns from the total information. These records can generally be broken down into three categories: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../819/2539819.xml">
Public records</link>, private records, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../274/1476274.xml">

 Identity score components </st>

<p>

Each identity scoring system uses individual data components to generate their score, meaning that results can vary wildly even for the same individual. </p>
<p>

Typical identity score components can include (but are not limited to): </p>
<p>

<b>Name components:</b> Personally identifying information such as name, address, etc.  </p>
<p>

<b>Behavioral use pattern components:</b> Analyzed patterns of behavior from information. </p>
<p>

<b>Internet components:</b> Personally identifying information found on the Internet, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/33898.xml">
Web sites</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/33645.xml">
blogs</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/38892.xml">
chat rooms</link>, etc. </p>
<p>

<b>Hacker and fraud components:</b> Personally identifying information that has been stolen in data breaches and may be used in recognizable patterns of fraud, such as unexplained <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/17182301.xml">
credit card</link> purchases </p>
<p>

<b>Synthetic identity components:</b> Personally identifying information that is being used to create a new false (“<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/446403.xml">
synthetic</link>”) identity. </p>
<p>

<b>Predictive analytics in identity scores
</b></p>
<p>

Identity scores are sometimes calculated using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../563/4141563.xml">
predictive analytics</link>, the science of taking behavioral data and comparing it against historical patterns to identify potentially risky or fraudulent activity. </p>
<p>

By compiling publicly available information and using predictive analytics to gauge the patterns of how the information is used, identity scoring systems can measure the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../418/1201418.xml">
authenticity</link> of a particular identity.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
 Usage of identity scores </st>

<p>

Identity scoring can be used in a variety of ways, from identity verification and measuring fraud risk on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/4918223.xml">
enterprise</link> level, to preventing fraudulent use of identities and synthetic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/180609.xml">
identity theft</link> on the consumer level. Identity scoring can theoretically provide much more definitive proof of an identity’s legitimacy, because of the amount of identifying data it utilizes. Virtually all public information about an individual can be used as data in their identity score. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
Identity scores vs. credit scores</st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/3842655.xml">
Credit scores</link> are compiled from information sources relating to credit, such as number of credit accounts held, balances on each account, dates of collection activity, and so on. Credit scores do not measure any financial or personal activity that is not related to credit, and identity fraud that does not involve credit will not appear on your <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../274/1476274.xml">
credit report</link> or affect your credit score. Credit scores and the credit scoring system are also very predictable—there are specific steps you follow to improve your credit score, dispute errors in credit reports, etc. </p>
<p>

Identity scores are compiled from much larger sources of information, including criminal records, property records, and so on. Identity scoring enables “grading” of patterns of behavior via predictive analytics, from which an identity monitoring service can track an individual’s or criminal group’s activity across several enterprises, instead of being confined to monitoring just one area. </p>
<p>

Identity scores are also much more mutable and “fuzzy” than credit scores, because the source information—public records and personally identifying information—is constantly changing. Every time an individual changes a job, buys or sells property, or has an encounter with law enforcement, their public records are altered. Coordinating the information across so many different sources makes it very difficult to fix errors in one’s information once they occur.</p>
<p>

Where credit scores have a generally accepted model of a three-digit-number (used for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../448/462448.xml">
FICO score</link>, the new <work wordnetid="100575741" confidence="0.8">

, and credit bureaus' proprietary scores), identity scoring models vary wildly from product to product. </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Identity scores and identity theft</st>

<p>

Identity scoring works by matching the information the user provides against billions of records in public <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
databases</link>, ranging from property and tax records to Internet <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/4059023.xml">
search engines</link>, and calculating it against patterns designed to recognize fraud or identity theft.</p>
<p>

<it>Example: Wendy's name and <amount wordnetid="105107765" confidence="0.8">
<symbol wordnetid="106806469" confidence="0.8">
<magnitude wordnetid="105090441" confidence="0.8">
<signal wordnetid="106791372" confidence="0.8">
<property wordnetid="104916342" confidence="0.8">
<number wordnetid="105121418" confidence="0.8">
<identifier wordnetid="107270601" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../702/48702.xml">
Social Security number</link></identifier>
</number>
</property>
</signal>
</magnitude>
</symbol>
</amount>
 were stolen by identity thieves who hacked a stolen <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../584/198584.xml">
laptop</link>. They take her Social Security number and combine it with another stolen name, and use it to open a series of new accounts, including credit cards and retail <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../068/743068.xml">
gift cards</link>. An identity protection system that used identity scoring would alert Wendy that her Social Security number had been compromised.</it></p>
<p>

Because identity scores include much more accurate information and can predict behavior patterns more definitively than credit scores, the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/250363.xml">
Gartner</link></company>
 research firm predicted that identity scoring will surpass credit monitoring as the leading identity theft prevention measure by 2009. However, Gartner research analyst Avivah Litan warned that identity scoring was not a foolproof system, as it still relied on the underlying accuracy of the information used. </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Identity scores and breeder documents</st>

<p>

Reliance on “breeder documents” (documents designed to verify other documents) to verify identities is flawed, as there is no standardized means to verify that information contained in breeder documents is legitimate.  Identity scoring can be used as a tool to authenticate identities on an independent level in cases of employment hiring and information verification. </p>
<p>

Currently there is no standard means to verify that information provided on an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/1747739.xml">
I-9</link> work document is legitimate, for example. The desire for industries to quickly hire cheap labor trumps any incentive a business has to check the credentials of their new hires, leading to a “gray market” for stolen identities and contributing to continuing surges in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/7124412.xml">
illegal immigration</link>. Tools that employ identity scoring to verify that a person’s name and Social Security number match, or that their I-9 data is correct, could cut down on the sale and misuse of personal information while enabling better enforcement of immigration law.</p>
