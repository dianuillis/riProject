UBO 2006</st>
<p>

Returning to independent development, the release version of UBO 2006 brought completely automated tournament game play. It featured tournament record keeping and tournament-specific Leader Board statistics, extending player information beyond the previous edition's pick up game statistics and Leader Board statistics. Tournament statistics were posted to the UBO Website in real time so players can track their own and their teammates' statistics and scout out the performance of opposing players during the course of the tournament. Significant player achievements are also posted to personal character Web pages.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

UBO 2007</st>
<p>

Featuring new mini-games and a power ranking system, Ultimate Baseball Online 2007 was rolled out on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/19346.xml">
March 1</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">

Free Agent</link> Tournaments were also added, allowing for tournament play outside of the team structure, and extending the opportunity for gamers to meet other players. Changes to Artificial Intelligence and updated graphics were additional elements bundled in the new version.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

UBO 2007 included the awarding of Power Ranking Points for teams, based on their performance in a wide variety of UBO leagues and tournaments. Points are accumulated throughout the year, with the top 64 UBO teams earning a berth in competition dubbed the "Best of UBO" event.</p>

Cal Ripken's Real Baseball</st>
<p>

Real Baseball is a rebranded version of UBO 2007 with new features. One of the most prominent features is the new Anti-hack protection. Other new features include revamped camp system, mission system, new stadium, and new uniforms. Hitting has also been modified.</p>
<p>

DMA (Designers Management Agency) formalized the partnership between Hall of Famer Cal Ripken, Jr. and Netamin Communication Corporation, creating Cal Ripken’s Real Baseball, a free online video game and community for baseball enthusiasts around the world.  Cal Ripken’s Real Baseball (www.PlayRealBaseball.com) is the new name of the community/video game which was previously known as Ultimate Baseball Online or UBO.  The newly named game launched from Disney’s ESPN The Weekend on February 28th and received over 10,000 downloads within the first 72 hours of availability.</p>
<p>

Cal Ripken’s Real Baseball enables gamers to compete in a Massively Multiplayer Online Sport Game (MMOSG), meaning each position on the field is manned by a human player in a 3-D virtual stadium.  Players can create their own characters and build their skill level (player stats) through successful play on the field against other real human players. Unlike current video games that aim to simulate professional sports, Real Baseball (RB) delivers a third-person perspective of a character, created and developed by the player, interacting online in real-time with teammates and opponents playing from numerous locations.</p>
<p>

“I am very pleased that Cal Ripken, Jr. and Netamin have come together to create a fun, innovative, and technologically patented Baseball Game for fans worldwide to enjoy,” said Marc Beckman, founder and CEO of DMA.  “From a business POV, the match makes a lot of sense; Cal will provide the programmers with a certain level of authenticity that would not be achievable otherwise.”</p>
<p>

A client of DMA, Ripken is baseball’s all-time “Iron Man” having played 16 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles and playing in a record, 2,632 straight games.  He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.  </p>
<p>

Real Baseball was created by Andy Wang, founder and CEO of Netamin Communication Corporation, the first company in the world to develop the technology to build a Massively Multiplayer Online Sports Game (MMSOG).  Netamin is headquartered in Diamond Bar, California with additional operations in Korea
Other deals DMA has structured for Ripken include a developmental deal incorporating a documentary being produced by Renegade Studios about Ripken’s Sports Envoy trip to China in October 2007: a Fathead in which Ripken became the first retired athlete to be produced: specialty gift cards to be launched nationwide in 2008.  DMA is also close to finalizing a deal for Ripken and Major League Baseball. </p>
<p>

Real Baseball has been in existence for three years in a beta mode under the name Ultimate Baseball Online, and currently boasts approximately 7,000 players worldwide.  Over the past three years Ultimate Baseball Online have seen strong participation in the United States, Canada, Taiwan, Korea, England, Italy, South Africa, Brazil and Australia.</p>

 2008 </st>

<p>

In September 2008, shortly after introducing a system allowing players the option of purchasing levels by credit card, Netamin shut down their website, and turned off all gameservers.
No information was released to the public regarding the sudden shutdown of Real Baseball Online, Netamin or possible refunds.
It is currently unknown if Netamin will re-publish Real Baseball Online, or even keep running as a company.</p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/10635766.xml">
Real Baseball</link> is a <link>
massively multiplayer online sports game</link> capable of fielding up to 18 players a game, occupying all active positions in the game of baseball. However, players often refuse to field 18 due to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/19572286.xml">
lag</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/28738.xml">
synchronization</link> issues. Game characters are based on a level of ranks for a specific range of levels, from 0-99, with 99 being the maximum level attained. The game-coded team names of Home and Away team are used instead of the player created team names; therefore, players can play with each other in normal servers regardless of the team they belong. Team play is only enforced however, as expected, in Team Tournaments and the UBO League. Game settings also allows the option day and night of three, six, and nine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../032/463032.xml">
inning</link> games, with extra innings if necessary in two stadiums.</p>

Pitching</st>
<p>

The game offers 12 pitches and varying speeds, and some pitches must be "unlocked" through the addition of parameter points to arm strength or throwing accuracy. Velocity and break of pitches can also be enhanced through the addition of skill points, or naturally enhanced through switching arm throwing angles. When throwing you must not forget to pick a pitch and if you pick the wrong pitch you can go back and pick a different pitch. After your good every throw is a strike!

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Batting</st>
<p>

Batting in Real Baseball requires the use of a mouse to track the pitch and click to swing. There are numerous power settings that can be accessed through right clicking; turning down power increases contact likelihood, while increasing power decreases it. The maximum power is red, while the minimum is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/8935707.xml">
bunt</link>. Depending on how well contact is made, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../148/14148.xml">
Home Run</link> can be hit. </p>
<p>

Batting power is amplified through the addition of parameter points in body strength and stamina.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Fielding</st>
<p>

From outfield to infield to foul ground, fielders must complete plays, make outs, and prevent runs from scoring, much like in real life baseball. Players in Real Baseball can run, catch (jump and dive), and throw unlike some flash-based baseball games. Real Baseball simplifies the system by assigning a number to each base and pitcher, and by pressing the number, throws will be aimed there. Wild throws can occasionally and randomly happen.</p>
<p>

Catching Range is the primary statistic associated with fielding. In the event a full game is not reached, the AI takes the field and plays the position.</p>

RBO League</st>
<p>

<image location="right" width="150px" src="UBOLeague.jpg">

Real Baseball hosts seasonal leagues that feature multiple teams of different levels playing against each other for the championship. Managed and run by Netamin and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/12373.xml">
Game Masters</link>, there are currently three league classes: MVP, All-Star, and Major.</p>
<p>

Current Leagues include a 10-game <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/690345.xml">
regular season</link> for all participating teams, 3-game <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../132/78132.xml">
wildcard</link> playoffs, 4-game division finals, and a 5-game league <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../434/3884434.xml">
championship</link> for eligible teams. Press Coverage and Awards are also presented during the league seasons written by the official game press and players. Winners of RBO Leagues qualify themselves into the Best of RBO competition.</p>

<st>
Tournaments</st>
<p>

Netamin often host weekly tournaments to provide on-going opportunities to earn power ranking points as well as play as a team. Any team, pending if requirements are met, can join tournaments and compete against each other at the specified time of the tournament. Entire tournaments may last several days, pending on how many teams are entered.</p>

<ss1>

Power Ranking Points</st>
<p>

Power Ranking Points (PRP's), are points accumulated through the participation of RBO Leagues and tournaments based on performance. The top 64 teams in PRP's will qualify for the Best of RBO event.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Real Baseball's Controversial Shutdown</st>
<p>

On September 22nd 2008, the <it>Cal Ripken's Real Baseball</it> game servers and website went down inexplicably. No further information is available as to why the service is down, and no date was given as to when the service would be available again. </p>
<p>

Much of the player base was angered by such a move, as Netamin had recently implemented a level-buying system. Some players had forked over hundreds of dollars on their characters. This prompt shutdown of the game was incredibly saddening to the community, as the Netamin failed to provide any further information about the shutdown.</p>
<p>

On October 8th, 2008, www.netamin.com returned to its old self, signifying some gleam of hope for all players.  It has been posted on playrealbaseball.com forums that "RBO or some form of RBO will return", however, no time table is announced. </p>
