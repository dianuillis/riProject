In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link>, <b>eager learning</b> is a learning method in which the system tries to construct a general, input independent target function during training of the system, as opposed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/10747879.xml">
lazy learning</link>, where generalization beyond the training data is delayed until a query is made to the system. <p>

The main advantage gained in employing an eager learning method, such as an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/21523.xml">
artificial neural network</link>, is that the target function will be approximated globally during training, thus requiring much less space than a lazy learning system. Eager learning systems also deal much better with noise in the training data. Eager learning is an example of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../030/10748030.xml">
offline learning</link>, in which post-training queries to the system have no effect on the system itself, and thus the same query to the system will always produce the same result.</p>
<p>

The main disadvantage with eager learning is that it is generally unable to provide good local approximations in the target function.</p>
