Influence</st>
<p>

Schank was one of the influential early contributors to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/5961.xml">
cognitive psychology</link> in the 1970s and 1980s. Schank's major innovations in these fields were his concepts of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../333/170333.xml">
case based reasoning</link> and dynamic memory. Both of these were opposed to more traditional views of memory and reasoning in the field. The classic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/7646.xml">
cognitivist</link> view of cognition popular at the time viewed cognition as being the rule (or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>) bound manipulation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/37673.xml">
symbols</link>. Schank on the other hand stated that memory was in the form of meaningful 'stories' (not merely inert decontextualized information) and that problem solving progressed by using 'cases' or examples stored in memory. So for example, in the 'classical' view, when we walk to the store, we accomplish this because we have access to a stored algorithm that tells us 'step one, open door, step two, step into street' and so on. In Schank's view on the other hand, we accomplish this because we have access to a stored 'schema' based on previous experience of what it is like to walk to the store, and we don't need rules to describe this.  Schank and his students at Yale initially applied these ideas to the problem of computer recognition of English (called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/98778.xml">
natural language understanding</link>) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but progress eventually stalled and those methods fell into disuse.</p>
