Coverage limitations</st>

<p>

The ECHO benefit provides a government cost-share limit of $2,500 per month, per eligible family member. In addition to other TRICARE ECHO benefits, beneficiaries who are homebound may qualify for extended in-home health care services. The $2,500 cost share does not apply to the ECHO Home Health Care (EHHC) as there is a benefit cap. </p>
<p>

For certain benefits, ECHO requires recipients to first use public funds and facilities to the extent that they are available and adequate.</p>
<p>

Under ECHO, sponsors must pay part of the monthly-authorized expenses for their family members, based on their pay grade, ranging from $25 to $75 a month for all enlisted and most officers.</p>
