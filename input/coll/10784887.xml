<b>Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA)</b> refers to any one of several models of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/25220.xml">
quantum computation</link>, which have been devised in analogy to conventional models of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../342/54342.xml">

 Usage of the term </st>
<p>

In the context of models of computation or of physical systems, <it>quantum cellular automaton</it> is a term currently without a single agreed-upon meaning. However, models of quantum cellular automata tend to attempt to merge or borrow elements of both (1)&nbsp;the study of cellular automata in conventional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/5323.xml">
computer science</link> and (2)&nbsp;the study of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/659094.xml">
quantum information processing</link>. In particular, the following are common features of models of quantum cellular automata:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The computation is considered to come about by parallel operation of multiple computing devices, or <b>cells</b>. The cells are usually taken to be identical, finite-dimensional quantum systems (e.g. each cell is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../284/25284.xml">
qubit</link>);</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Each cell has a neighborhood of other cells. Altogether these form a network of cells, which is usually taken to be regular (e.g. the cells are arranged as a lattice with or without periodic boundary conditions);</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The evolution of all of the cells has a number of physics-like symmetries. Locality is one: the next state of a cell depends only on its current state and that of its neighbours. Homogeneity is another: the evolution acts the same everywhere, and is independent of time;</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The state space of the cells, and the operations performed on them, should be motivated by principles of quantum mechanics.</entry>
</list>

One feature that is often considered important for a model of quantum cellular automata is that it should be universal for quantum computation (i.e. that it can efficiently simulate quantum Turing machines<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, some arbitrary <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../404/707404.xml">
quantum circuit</link> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> or simply all other quantum cellular automata <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>).
Models which have been proposed recently impose further conditions, e.g. that quantum cellular automata should be reversible and/or local unitary, and have an easily determined global transition function from the rule for updating individual cells <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. Recent results show that these properties can be derived axiomatically, from the symmetries the global evolution <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

Early proposals</st>
<p>

The concept of a cellular automaton operating on quantum mechanical principles dates back at least to <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/25523.xml">
Richard Feynman</link></scientist>
</person>
, who suggested an initial approach to  quantizing a model of cellular automata.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> Gerhard Grössing and <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/918635.xml">
Anton Zeilinger</link></scientist>
 introduced the term "quantum cellular automata" to refer to a model they defined in 1988:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> however, their model has very little in common with the concepts developed in quantum computation after David Deutsch's formal development of that subject in 1989,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> and so has not been developed significantly as a model of computation.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
Models of universal quantum computation</st>
<p>

The first formal model of quantum cellular automata to be researched in depth was that introduced by John Watrous.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> This model was developed further by Wim van Dam,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> as well as Christoph Dürr,  Huong LêThanh, and Miklos Santha,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>, Josef Gruska.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> and Pablo Arrighi <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>.  However it was later realised that this definition was too loose, in the sense that some instances of it allow superluminal signalling <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>. A second wave of models includes those of Susanne Richter and Reinhard Werner<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref>, of Benjamin Schumacher and Reinhard Werner<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>, of Carlos Pérez-Delgado and Donny Cheung<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, and of Pablo Arrighi, Vincent Nesme and Reinhard Werner <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>. These are all closely related, and do not suffer any such locality issue. In the end one can say that they all agree to picture quantum cellular automata as just some large quantum circuit, infinitely repeating across time and space.</p>

Models of physical systems</st>
<p>

Models of quantum cellular automata have been proposed by David Meyer,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> by Bruce Bogosian and Washington Taylor,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> and by Peter Love and Bruce Bogosian <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> as a means of simulating quantum lattice gases, motivated by the use of "classical" cellular automata to model classical physical phenomena such as gas dispersion.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>

Quantum dot cellular automata</st>
<p>

A proposal for implementing <it>classical</it> cellular automata by systems designed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/511547.xml">
quantum dots</link> has been proposed under the name "quantum cellular automata" by <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 and Craig Lent,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref> as a replacement for classical computation using CMOS technology. In order to better differentiate between this proposal and models of cellular automata which perform quantum computation, many authors working on this subject now refer to this as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/8411212.xml">
quantum dot cellular automaton</link>.</p>
