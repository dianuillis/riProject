A <b>beer bottle</b> is a glass (or, less commonly, plastic) container filled with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/3363.xml">
beer</link>. Bottled beer has been in use since as early as the 16th century. Beer bottles come in various sizes, shapes and colours. Dark glass prevents light from spoiling the beer.  However, lighter coloured bottles are often used for marketing reasons.<p>

The first nationwide standardised beer bottles were introduced in Sweden in 1886.  The medium size, 330&nbsp;<link>

<sec>
<st>
Bottling lines</st>
<p>

Bottling lines are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/819847.xml">
production line</link>s that fill beer into bottles on a large scale.</p>
<p>

This typically involves drawing beer from a holding tank and filling it into bottles in a filling machine (<it>filler</it>), which are then capped, labeled and packed into cases or cartons. Many smaller breweries send their bulk beer to large facilities for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../537/19280537.xml">
contract</link> bottling - though some will bottle by hand. </p>
<p>

The first step in bottling beer is <it>depalletising</it>, where the empty bottles are removed from the original <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/868594.xml">
pallet</link> packaging delivered from the manufacturer, so that individual bottles may be handled. The bottles may then be rinsed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../068/514068.xml">
filter</link>ed water or air, and may have <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/5906.xml">
carbon dioxide</link> injected into them in attempt to reduce the level of oxygen within the bottle. The bottle then enters a "filler" which fills the bottle with beer and may also inject a small amount of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/248159.xml">
inert gas</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/5906.xml">
CO2</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/21175.xml">
nitrogen</link>) on top of the beer to disperse <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../303/22303.xml">
oxygen</link>, as O2 can ruin the quality of the product by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/66313.xml">
oxidation</link>. </p>
<p>

Next the bottle enters a labelling machine ("labeller") where a label is applied. The product is then packed into boxes and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/549146.xml">
warehouse</link>d, ready for sale.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Bottle Styles</st>

<ss1>
<st>
Stubby</st>
<p>

A short glass bottle used for beer is generally called a <it>stubby</it>.  Shorter and flatter than longneck bottles, stubbies pack into a smaller space for transporting.  The bottles are sometimes made with thick glass so that the bottle can be cleaned and reused before being <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../157/70157.xml">
recycle</link>d.  The capacity of a stubby is generally somewhere between 330 and 375 millilitres (11â€“13 fl oz).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Some of the expected advantages of stubby bottles are:

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<p>

Stubbies are used extensively in Europe, and were used almost exclusively in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/1637673.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22The+stubby+bottle%22])">
Canada</link> from 1962 to 1986 as part of a standardization effort intended to reduce breakage, and the cost of sorting bottles when they were returned by customers.  Due to their nostalgic value, stubbies were reintroduced by a number of Canadian craft brewers in the early 2000s.  Ontario's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../878/18878.xml">
monopolistic</link> beer retailer, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/849642.xml">
Brewers Retail</link>, caused an uproar in 2002 when it withheld industry standard longneck bottles from those breweries that were offering stubbies.  In the United States, stubbies have generally fallen out of favour, with only a few brands still using them such as the Session <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/19555312.xml">

An often overlooked benefit of the stubby bottle is the ability to throw it back, meaning there is little chance of the beer's foaming and creating a head, thus overflowing the bottle.</p>

Longneck</st>

<ss2>
<st>
Australian longneck</st>
<p>

The Australian longneck is a bottle of 750&nbsp;ml (26.4&nbsp;imp fl&nbsp;oz/25.4&nbsp;U.S. fl&nbsp;oz) capacity. In Queensland a longneck is known as a <it>tallie</it>. In Western Australia a longneck is known as a <it>king brown</it>. <brewery wordnetid="102897237" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/1490230.xml">
Carlton &amp; United Beverages</link></brewery>
 had increased their longneck size to 800&nbsp;ml (28.2&nbsp;imp fl&nbsp;oz/27.1&nbsp;U.S. fl&nbsp;oz), but have recently reverted back to the 750&nbsp;ml bottle.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
North American longneck</st>
<p>

A North American longneck is a type of beer bottle with a long neck. It is known as the standard longneck bottle or industry standard bottle (ISB).  The ISB longnecks have a uniform capacity, height, weight and diameter and can be reused on average 16 times. The long neck offers a long cushion of air to absorb the pressure of carbonation to reduce the risk of exploding.  The American longneck holds 12 U.S. fl&nbsp;oz (355&nbsp;ml).  The Canadian longneck holds 12&nbsp;imp&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz (341&nbsp;ml).</p>
<p>

In Canada, in 1992, the large breweries agreed to all use a longneck bottle of standard size, thus replacing the traditional stubbie bottle.</p>

A bomber is a 22&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz (650&nbsp;ml/23&nbsp;imp fl&nbsp;oz) glass bottle that is commonly sold in American specialty markets and brewpubs. Bombers typically contain two to three servings of beer, which may be shared amongst friends. They are also a popular bottle type with homebrewers.</p>

In South Africa a 750-millilitre bottle is referred to as a <it>quart</it>.</p>

A forty is American <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../181/27181.xml">

malt liquor</link>.  Forties are more than three times as large as the standard American 12-U.S.-fluid-ounce (355&nbsp;ml) serving of beer.</p>

Growler</st>
<p>

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/1948318.xml">
growler</link> is a U.S. half <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../882/12882.xml">
gallon</link> (1890&nbsp;ml/66.6&nbsp;imp&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz) glass jug used to transport <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/8387.xml">
draft beer</link> in the United States. They are commonly sold at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../342/19555342.xml">
breweries</link> and brewpubs as a means to sell <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/326234.xml">
take-out</link> beer.  Some breweries also offer a one-litre or one-quart version.  Growlers are also used by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/146918.xml">
homebrewer</link>s as an alternative to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../772/1258772.xml">
keg</link>s or smaller bottles for carbonating and storing their beer.</p>
<p>

Growlers are generally made of glass and have either a screw-on cap or a hinged porcelain gasket cap which can provide freshness for a week or more.  A properly sealed growler will hold <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../397/253397.xml">
carbonation</link> indefinitely, but it is not an appropriate means of long term beer storage since it is not a sanitized form of packaging.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

A two-litre (70&nbsp;imp&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz/67&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz) "Darwin Stubby" is available in Australia's Northern Territory.  It is quite expensive and thus mostly a tourist gimmick. The Darwin Stubby was first introduced in April 1958 with an 80-imperial-fluid-ounce (2,270&nbsp;ml/76.9&nbsp;U.S. fl&nbsp;oz) capacity.</p>

De Nederlandse Bierfles is more commonly known as <it>pijpje</it> (little pipe). The pijpje was introduced in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/34761.xml">

<p>

In some cases, such as <link>
Miller High Life</link>, a hop extract that does not have isohumulones is used to bitter the beer so it cannot be "lightstruck". Bottles with dark brown glass give some protection to the beer, but green and clear glass offer virtually no protection at all.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

Bottle identifier bumps</st>

<p>

The "bumps" are moulded in by the glass manufacturer and identify the mould that produced the bottle. They can be read electronically by the glass company in the case of a glass defect to allow for identification of the mould and containment of other bottles produced on the same mould.</p>
