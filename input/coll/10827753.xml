 appears and deflects them into differing water towers. Admiring the damage his attack has done to his water tower, Sasuke believes himself to be stronger than Naruto. On closer inspection, he finds Naruto's tower to be considerably worse off (Sasuke made an inward pucnture in his tower, but Naruto's tower may just look like it has a dent in the front, he actually blew a giant hole in the back of it!), and only comes to envy Naruto's strength more. Kakashi takes Sasuke aside and lectures him about not attacking friends. Sasuke then threatens to kill every one who means something to Kakashi, who then tells him that he is too late, because they're all already dead. While Sasuke debates on whether to stay with the village or take revenge on Itachi, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../453/3512453.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Sound+Four%22])">

Sasuke continues his battle with the Sound Four, but eventually becomes too injured, including being weakened by using the Curse Mark. The Sound Four tell stories of how Sasuke can become stronger if he lended himself to Orochimaru. Sasuke, tired of playing ninja games, finally gives in, and goes to them. Sakura tries to stop him, but fails as Sasuke vanishes before she can persuade him more and faints.&nbsp;</col>

As the first step in gaining power, Sasuke's cursed seal must be advanced to its second state. For this to happen, the Sound Four seals Sasuke into a barrel and carry him from Konoha as his seal advances. They are confronted by two nearby Konoha ninja, Raido Namiashi and Genma Shiranui, but eventually defeat them thanks to their cursed seals. After carrying Sasuke for a ways, the Sound Four takes a break, giving the recently caught up retrieval team a chance to try a sneak attack. Their presence is detected, and the Sound Four attacks them before they can make a move.&nbsp;</col>

Deciding to attack Neji from a distance, Kidomaru advances his seal to its first level and sends multiple spiders to attack Neji. Neji is able to repel them all, though Kidomaru notices a delayed reaction in some of Neji's blocks. He theorizes that Neji's defenses has a blind spot, and attacks him further from this blind spot. His theory is proven correct as Neji is unable to block the attack. Believing himself to have found Neji's weakness, Kidomaru prepares to finish the battle.&nbsp;</col>

After advancing his cursed seal to its second state and creating a bow and arrow with his webs, Kidomaru begins taking shots at Neji's blind spot. Neji is able to block the attacks enough to keep them from hitting vital areas, though is still left heavily damaged with each of Kidomaru's attacks. Ready to finish the battle, Kidomaru prepares his most deadly arrow for use, and fires it at Neji. Neji takes the arrow full force, though already knowing of his blind spot moves at the last second to keep the arrow from piercing his heart. With Kidomaru's arrow connected to him by a web, Neji sends his chakra into the web, paralyzing Kidomaru. As Kidomaru lies helpless, Neji approaches him and deals a finishing blow. His injuries too severe, Neji collapses, leaving the retrieval of Sasuke up to the others.&nbsp;</col>

Naruto arrives in the nick of time to save Sakura, but not before Kabuto tells her that Sasuke is dead. Naruto tells her not to believe him and a battle ensues. Naruto defeats him with the Rasengan, but Kabuto traps him in some chakra threads that connect their hearts; if Kabuto's stops, so will Naruto's. As Kabuto attempts to kill himself to end Naruto's life, Sakura tries to free him. Sasame arrives and saves Naruto, only to find out that the Kabuto they fought is actually Kagerou, who dies suggesting that Sasame should not know what Arashi has become. They finally find Arashi, who has been disguised as Orochimaru, who reveals that he has indeed changed.&nbsp;</col>

Naruto takes on Arashi, but gets trapped easily. Sakura thinks he's dead and Naruto ends up blowing his sneak attack cover to protect her. Naruto tries his attack again, but his injury causes a problem. Naruto gets trapped in an attack that will crush him if he doesn't get out. Sasame attacks Arashi and manages to set him free for a second. However, it doesn't last long and he soon tries to kill Sasame. Sakura jumps in the way and says she will give her life to protect her friends. Naruto tells her she can't die and Arashi tries to finish Naruto off. Sasame causes enough of a distraction for Naruto to break free. The attack caused by Naruto frees Arashi, and Arashi protects Sasame. The place begins to collapse and Jiraiya arrives. Arashi throws them out and tells them he can't leave since he is a puppet. He tells Naruto that Sasuke is alive and they all leave, leaving Arashi behind. The Fuma Clan promises to rebuild their town and everyone heads back to Konoha. Considering herself to have been of little use, Sakura asks to become Tsunade's pupil and learn to become a medical ninja.&nbsp;</col>
