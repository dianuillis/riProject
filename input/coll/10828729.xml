<p>

The SHPS company was founded in 1997, as a joint venture between Sykes Enterprises and Health Plan Services, and financed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/1211937.xml">
Prudential</link> Services.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In December 1997, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/1211937.xml">
Prudential</link> Services and Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated formed Sykes HealthPlan Services, Inc. SHPS was at that time owned fifty percent by each of the founding companies and was created to provide care management services, technology solutions, certain customer support services, and other outsourcing capabilities to the health care and insurance industries.
Prudential Services invested $17.0 million in SHPS and guaranteed a line of credit of up to $37.5 million to fund the activities of SHPS. On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../935/27935.xml">
September 11</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/34647.xml">
1998</link>, Prudential sold its 50% interest in SHPS to Sykes for $30.6 million and recognized a gain on the sale of SHPS of $27.9 million.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

In the year 2000 SHPS was purchased by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

SHPS is a company that aims to turn "employees into savvy consumers of health care." The company provides administrative services that integrate traditional benefits administration with disease management programs and decision-support tools that try to encourage users to stay healthier and use benefits more wisely;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> the hoped-for end result is lower overall health care costs. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

They are targeted at a specific market group, including large market organizations (10,000+ employees, mid-market organizations (1,000 – 10,000 employees) and federal, state and local governments. As a support and wrap around partner SHPS does not provide the primary care or the insurance, rather it attempts to make the services offered in the healthcare world more accessible to consumers. SHPS Partners with business and "channels" (healthcare service related companies or organizations) to work towards this goal. Channel partners for SHPS include health plans and insurance companies, Medicare Part D providers, pharmacy benefit managers, third party administrators, health and benefits brokers and hospitals.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

An example of state contracted services is Medicaid. SHPS has been working to find ways to make Medicaid less expensive and more efficient for both consumer and government. Medicaid support is offered in fulfillment, contact centers, case management, and other self described “wrap around” services needed.
The company has also been working with policy makers and outside organizations to develop new solutions to Medicaid delivery. An example was illustrated when the company President and CEO was on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/11121.xml">
