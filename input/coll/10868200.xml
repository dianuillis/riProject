A <b>downhole safety valve</b> refers to a component on an <link>
 oil and gas well</link>, which acts as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/41136.xml">
failsafe</link> to prevent the uncontrolled release of <link>
 reservoir</link> fluids in the event of a worst case scenario surface disaster.  It is almost always installed as a vital component on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/13892184.xml">
 completion</link>.

Operation</st>
<p>

These valves are commonly uni-directional flapper valves which open downwards, such that the flow of <link>
 wellbore fluids</link> try to push it shut, while pressure from surface pushes it open. This means that when closed, it will isolate the reservoir fluids from surface.</p>
<p>

Most downhole safety valves are controlled hydraulically from surface, meaning they are opened using a hydraulic connection linked directly to a well control panel.  When hydraulic pressure is applied down a control line, the hydraulic pressure forces a sleeve within the valve to slide downwards. This movement compresses a large spring and pushes the flapper downwards to open the valve.  When hydraulic pressure is removed, the spring pushes the sleeve back up and causes the flapper to shut. In this way, it is failsafe and will isolate the wellbore in the event of a loss of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/3187823.xml">
wellhead</link>. The full designation for a typical valve is 'tubing retrievable, surface controlled, subsurface safety valve', abbreviated to TR-SCSSV.</p>

Positioning</st>
<p>

The location of the downhole safety valve within the <link>
 completion</link> is a precisely determined parameter intended to optimise safety.  There are arguments against it either being too high or too low in the <link>
 well</link> and so the final depth is a compromise of all factors.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Reasons to keep it high</st>
<p>

The further down the <link>
 well</link> the DHSV is located, the greater the potential inventory of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/13257.xml">
hydrocarbon</link>s above it when closed.  This means that in the event of loss of containment at surface, there is more fluid to be spilled causing environmental damage, or in the worst case, more fuel for a fire.  Therefore, placing the valve higher limits this hazard.</p>
<p>

Another reason relates to the hydraulic control line.  Hydraulic pressure is required to keep the valve open as part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/41136.xml">
failsafe</link> design.  However, if the valve is too far down the <link>
 well</link>, then the portion of the control line below the surface is larger.  If it is too large, then the weight of the hydraulic fluid alone may apply sufficient pressure to keep the valve open, even with the loss of surface pressurisation.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Reasons to keep it low</st>
<p>

As part of the role of the DHSV to isolate the surface from wellbore fluids, it is necessary for the valve to be positioned away from the well where it could potentially come to harm.  This implies that it must be placed subsurface in all circumstances, i.e. in offshore wells, not above the seabed.  There is also the risk of cratering in the event of a catastrophic loss of the topside facility.  The valve is specifically placed below the maximum depth where cratering is expected to be a risk.</p>

Deploying and retrieving</st>
<p>

Most downhole safety valves installed as part of the <link>
 completion</link> design are classed as "tubing retrievable".  This means that they are installed as a component of the completion string and run in during completion.  Retrieving the valve, should it malfunction, requires a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../713/10867713.xml">
workover</link>.  The full name for this most common type of downhole safety valve is a Tubing Retrievable Surface Controlled Sub-Surface Valve, shortened in completion diagrams to TRSCSSV.</p>
<p>

If a tubing retrievable valve fails, rather than go to the expense of a workover, a "wireline retrievable" valve may be used instead.  This type of valve can fit inside the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/3181603.xml">
production tubing</link> and is deployed on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../882/307882.xml">
wireline</link> after the old valve has been straddled open.</p>

The importance of DHSVs is undisputed.  Graphic images of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../570/198570.xml">

, no law mandates the use of DHSVs.  However, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../830/4389830.xml">
1974 Health &amp; Safety at Work Act</link> requires that measures are taken to ensure that the uncontrolled release of wellbore fluids is prevented even in the worst case.  The brilliance of the act is that it does not issue prescriptive guideline for how to achieve the goal of health and safety, but merely sets out the requirement that the goal be achieved.  It is up to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../887/994887.xml">
oil companies</link> to decide how to achieve it and DHSVs are an important component of that decision.  As such, although not a legal requirement, it is company policy for many operators in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../265/11168265.xml">
UKCS</link>.</p>

<p>

While the DHSV isolates the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/3181603.xml">
production tubing</link>, a loss of integrity could allow wellbore fluid to bypass the valve and escape to surface through the <link>
 annulus</link>.   For <link>
 well</link>s using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../282/980282.xml">
gas lift</link>, it is often a requirement to install a safety valve in the 'A' <link>
 annulus</link> of the well to ensure that the surface is protected from a loss of annulus containment.  However, these valves are not as common and they are not necessarily installed at the same position in the well, meaning it is possible that fluids could snake their way around the valves to surface.</p>
