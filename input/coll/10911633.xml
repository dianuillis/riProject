, Switzerland) was a scientist who devoted her entire life to showing that good health depends on a healthy diet. She was an outstanding physician of Russian origin and is a pioneer   in nutritionally based medicine. Kousmine focused her research on the following diseases: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
Cancer</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/50603.xml">
Multiple sclerosis</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../875/25875.xml">

auto-immune</link> diseases.</p>

Life</st>
<p>

Born in 1904 into a well-to-do family in Russia, Catherine Kousmine and her parents fled the country in 1918 during the Russian revolution. They settled in Switzerland, on the shores of Lake Geneva. The young Catherine went to the Ecole Supérieure of Lausanne where she graduated in sciences. She then went on to medical school. Upon graduation in 1928 with mention, she moved to Zurich, in professor <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/2593455.xml">
Guido Fanconi</link>'s unit, to specialize in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/23593.xml">
pediatrics</link>, then worked in Vienna, Austria, where she got her degree in pediatrics.</p>
<p>

Back in Switzerland, she had to resume her work as a general practitioner because her degree in pediatrics was not recognized by Swiss authorities. Dr. Catherine Kousmine spent most of her life in Switzerland. She set up a foundation in her name in <town wordnetid="108665504" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../078/582078.xml">
Lutry</link></town>
, Switzerland, to promote her methods (Fondation Catherine Kousmine). This foundation has sister foundations in France, Germany and Italy. There is also a Kousmine Medical Center in <town wordnetid="108665504" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Research</st>
<p>

She decided to conduct research in cancer, mostly because of the death from it of two children in her care while she was working as a general practitioner. For seventeen years, working in a makeshift laboratory in her kitchen, she studied a special breed of mice that develop mammalian cancer at four months of age. She discovered a striking correlation between a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../671/1581671.xml">
healthy diet</link> and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/5827094.xml">
remission</link> of their cancer and became convinced that the cure for diseases sometimes labeled "incurable" involves the return to a healthy feeding habit - one that provides all the nutrients that the organism needs to function properly. Consequently, she focused her attention on healthy diet. In 1949, she treated with success her first of many cancer patients, this one suffering from <link>
reticulo-sarcoma</link>, thanks in part to the use of a healthy diet.</p>

 Her work on cold pressed (virgin) oils </st>
<p>

Catherine Kousmine took a particular interest in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../331/192331.xml">
vegetable oils</link> because their quality had been greatly altered during <military_action wordnetid="100952963" confidence="0.8">

. Producers used new methods of oil extraction with heat (320°F - 392°F), the only goal of which was to produce half again the quantity of oil. The extraction with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../952/105952.xml">
hexane</link>, a hydrocarbon solvent with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/6445.xml">
carcinogenic</link> properties, allowed the production of almost twice the amount of oil.</p>
<p>

The major problem with these methods, compared to the cold pressed method that produces what is commonly called <link>
virgin oil</link>, is that the quality is poor in every respect: many of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/9130445.xml">
cis</link> molecules are transformed into the infamous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/264534.xml">
trans</link> molecules.</p>
<p>

Dr. Kousmine became a strong opponent of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../960/602960.xml">
processed food</link>, white sugar, refined flour and refined oil, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/193276.xml">
margarine</link> and butter, each of them being harmful to the body cells and providing only "empty calories", as she called them.</p>
<p>

Following up on work of the Foundation Catherine Kousmine, the trans-fatty acids have been the object of several studies worldwide. These studies showed that, even at small doses, the trans molecules are a health hazard. These studies lead some countries (Canada, USA, France for example) to make health recommendations. In 2003, Denmark reduced the proportion of trans-fatty acids to 2 grams per 100 grams of cooking oil. Trans-fatty acids were forbidden in New York in 2006. In the Netherlands, following an advertising campaign in the eighties, the amount of trans-fatty acids in margarine went from 50% down to 2% today.</p>

Theory about cancer </st>
<p>

Her novel approach was to understand what would cause a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/31214.xml">
tumor</link> to form and invade healthy cells, and NOT HOW TO DESTROY a tumor. After many extensive studies on mice, she came to the conclusion that cancer is a need of the organism to ward off a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../063/2880063.xml">
toxic</link> aggression (1).</p>
<p>

Briefly put, a tumor, first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../016/11693016.xml">
benign</link>, then <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/549900.xml">
malignant</link>, is just a particular form of a defense mechanism of the body. A tumor is not a freak and isolated accident, but a coherent reaction to a state of alarm. Her method focuses on how to disengage the source of the cancer and make it useless.</p>

Basic treatment</st>

<p>

<it>"The measures that I recommend start to be effective after about two months, and develop their full benefits only after two years,"</it>² Dr. Kousmine said.</p>

<p>

Dr. Kousmine noted that by consuming RAW virgin vegetable oil, such as cold pressed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/38869.xml">
flaxseed</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../622/57622.xml">
sunflower</link> oil rich in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/22594.xml">
omega-3</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/681218.xml">
omega-6</link> fatty acids and in vitamin E, it is possible to reduce the permeability of the intestinal membrane and to prevent toxins from invading the blood and overloading the kidneys and the liver, thus preventing the formation of a tumor and reducing the severity of any degenerative disease, like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>

She proclaimed the importance of organic sunflower oil and of whole grains. Her prescriptions for her patients included: Dr <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

's "<link>
crème Budwig</link>" (<link>
Budwig Cream</link>, a mixture of freshly ground cereals, flax and sunflower seeds, fruit, cold pressed sunflower or flaxseed oil and cottage cheese) along with <link>
essentials vitamins</link> (C, E, F, etc.), <link>
alkalizing minerals</link> to restore <link>
immunologic</link> balance in ill patients, all of them suffering from acidic blood, chamomile enemas to clean the intestines followed by an instillation of organic sunflower oil, and in some cases (rheumatoid arthritis), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/32653.xml">
vaccines</link>.</p>

<p>

<it>"If the patient is too ill, it is better to prepare him for surgery over a few weeks or months with the described measures. We then observe that the tumor stops growing, that it even shrinks in size, and that the general state of the patient improves, sometimes dramatically. Then, the result of delayed surgery or radiotherapy can be excellent."³
</it></p>
<p>

On one hand, her diet approach generally seems quite easy and pleasant to follow to ensure a daily <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/147020.xml">
hygiene</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/21525.xml">
nutrition</link> for a healthy person. On the other hand, for a patient with a sever <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../791/48791.xml">
pathology</link>, doctors and patients agree that the whole <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/197042.xml">
treatment</link> requires a tremendous personal investment and a life-time of strict <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/267487.xml">
discipline</link>.</p>

Criticism</st>
<p>

<it>"It is important that the treatment that I recommend is a beneficial COMPLEMENT to current medical treatments."</it>(4)</p>
<p>

Dr. Kousmine herself stated many times that eating <link>
Budwig Cream</link> and taking vitamin pills weren't the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../066/683066.xml">
magic bullet</link> to cure a disease like cancer. Contrary to what some critics have said, she always insisted that her method was a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/74139.xml">
complement</link> to, and not a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../097/1040097.xml">
substitute</link> for mainstream treatments. Advocates of her method claim that it dramatically improves the results of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../172/7172.xml">
chemotherapy</link> and reduces its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/151828.xml">
side-effects</link>.</p>
<p>

Even though countless people have benefited from her method, providing they follow the treatment to the letter for the rest of their lives, the orthodox medical community scoffed at her for many years, inaccurately reducing her theory and methods to Budwig Cream and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/32512.xml">
vitamin</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../053/19053.xml">
mineral</link> pills. Some cancer specialists even went so far as to state that their critically ill patients who followed her treatment and then went into complete <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/5827094.xml">
remission</link>, some of them for more than thirty years, had been simply "misdiagnosed". Today, physicians who treat patients with her method are still not well viewed by the orthodox medical community.
Dr. Kousmine repeatedly stated that the dramatic results (long - term remission, dramatic improvement of the quality of life for the most desperate patients) were not <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../041/52041.xml">
miraculous</link>, but instead the result of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../358/206358.xml">
holistic</link> approach to the disease, compared to the limited approach in orthodox medicine that focuses on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/196967.xml">
symptoms</link> of the disease, providing the patients only with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/275509.xml">
palliative</link> treatments.</p>
<p>

At the time of her death, criticism included that the benefits of raw, whole foods and cold pressed vegetable oils were not supported by scientific literature at all and that her theory has never been scientifically proven.
Other critics say that her monitoring of patients with MS was not scientific. Her study rested on no control group nor did she ever test her diet on healthy people to determine any protective effect.(5)</p>

Awards</st>
<p>

In 1985, the Société d'Encouragement au Progrès - whose headquarters are in Paris (France) - gave her the Médaille de Vermeil for her outstanding accomplishment with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>

In 1989, she was made an honorary citizen of the City of <town wordnetid="108665504" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Books</st>
<p>

Her books contain remarkable and detailed, easy-to-read for the non-specialist, accounts of patients with severe pathologies, documented with complete <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/594738.xml">
clinical</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../335/1676335.xml">
anamnesis</link> of the patients and their kin, the treatment provided and its results, successes as well as failures.</p>
<p>

These books also provide explanations about intestinal flora and processed food, with chapters about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/288316.xml">
instinct</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/524568.xml">
ancestral</link> feeding habits and an hypothesis on the connection between cancer, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../740/23740.xml">
toxins</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../107/228107.xml">
stress</link>.</p>
<p>

Critics say that the explanations are too simplistic and complain that some rants against chemical products are caricatural and/or lack any solid data (for example <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../752/2752.xml">
aspartame</link> and milk). Experts also complain that her books give the feeling that doctors don't understand anything "except me". (6)</p>

These books, that include a full description of her method, are available in French but have not yet been translated into English.</p>
