<b>Simulation software</b> is based on the process of imitating a real phenomenon with a set of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../040/164040.xml">
mathematical formulas</link>. It is, essentially, a program that allows the user to observe an operation through simulation without actually running the program. Simulation software is used widely to design equipment so that the final product will be as close to design specs as possible without expensive in process modification.<p>

Advanced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/5783.xml">
computer programs</link> can simulate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/33978.xml">
weather</link> conditions, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/9559.xml">
electronic circuits</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/6271.xml">
chemical reactions</link>, atomic reactions, even <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../450/5652450.xml">
biological processes</link>. In theory, any phenomena that can be reduced to mathematical data and equations can be simulated on a computer. In practice, however, simulation is extremely difficult because most natural phenomena are subject to an almost infinite number of influences. One of the tricks to developing useful simulations, therefore, is to determine which are the most important factors. </p>
<p>

In addition to imitating processes to see how they behave under different conditions, simulations are also used to test new theories. After creating a theory of causal relationships, the theorist can <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/860139.xml">
codify</link> the relationships in the form of a computer program. If the program then behaves in the same way as the real process, there is a good chance that the proposed relationships are correct. </p>
<p>

Electronics simulation software utilizes mathematical models to replicate the behaviour of an actual electronic device or circuit.  Essentially, it is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/5309.xml">
software</link> program that converts your <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/7878457.xml">
computer</link> into a fully functioning electronics laboratory.  Electronics simulators such as <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

schematic editor</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/180251.xml">
SPICE</link> simulator and on-screen waveforms and make “what-if” scenarios easy and instant. By simulating a circuit’s behaviour before actually building it greatly improves efficiency and provides insights into the behavior and stability of electronics circuit designs. Most simulators use a SPICE engine that simulates analog, digital and mixed A/D circuits for exceptional power and accuracy. They also typically contain extensive model and device libraries.  While these simulators typically have <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/65910.xml">
printed circuit board</link> (PCB) export capabilities, they are not essential for design and testing of circuits, which is the primary application of electronic circuit simulation. </p>

 <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. electronics circuit simulators, such as LTSPICE, the most popular simulators on the market, such as Multisim and <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, include both analog and event-driven digital simulation<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. capabilities, and are known as mixed-mode simulators <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. This means that any simulation may contain components that are analog, event driven (digital or sampled-data), or a combination of both. An entire mixed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../324/29324.xml">
signal analysis</link> can be driven from one integrated schematic. All the digital models in mixed-mode simulators provide accurate specification of propagation time and rise/fall time delays.</p>
<p>

The event driven <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> provided by mixed-mode simulators is general
purpose and supports non-digital types of data. For example, elements can use real or integer values to simulate DSP functions or sampled data filters. Because the event driven algorithm is faster than the standard SPICE matrix solution simulation time is greatly reduced for circuits that use event driven models in place of analog models <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>.</p>
<p>

Mixed-mode simulation is handled on three levels; (a) with primitive digital elements that use timing models and the built-in 12 or 16 state digital logic simulator, (b) with subcircuit models that use the actual transistor topology of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/15150.xml">
integrated circuit</link>, and finally, (c) with In-line <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/12351124.xml">
Boolean logic</link> expressions.</p>
<p>

Exact representations are used mainly in the analysis of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../811/41811.xml">
transmission line</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/3492525.xml">
signal integrity</link> problems where a close inspection of an IC’s I/O characteristics is needed. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/12351124.xml">
Boolean logic</link> expressions are delay-less functions that are used to provide efficient logic signal processing in an analog environment. These two modeling techniques use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/180251.xml">
SPICE</link> to solve a problem while the third method, digital primitives, use mixed mode capability. Each of these methods has its merits and target applications. In fact, many simulations (particularly those which use A/D technology) call for the combination of all three approaches. No one approach alone is sufficient.</p>
