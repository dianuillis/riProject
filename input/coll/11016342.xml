<b>Information need</b> is an individual or group's desire to locate and obtain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/18985062.xml">
information</link> to satisfy a conscious or unconscious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/622545.xml">
need</link>. The ‘information’ and ‘need’ in ‘information need’ are inseparable interconnection. Needs and interests call forth information. The objectives of studying information needs are:

 Background </st>

<p>

The concept of information needs was coined by an American information scientist <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.libsci.sc.edu/BOB/ISP/taylor2.htm">
Robert S. Taylor</weblink> in his article <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asi.5090130405">
"The Process of Asking Questions"</weblink> published in American Documentation (Now is Journal of the American Society of Information Science and Technology).</p>
<p>

In this paper, Taylor attempted to describe how an inquirer obtains an answer from an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../495/237495.xml">
information system</link>, by performing the process consciously or unconsciously; also he studied the reciprocal influence between the inquirer and a given system.</p>
<p>

According to Taylor, information need has four levels:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 The conscious and unconscious need for information not existing in the remembered experience of the investigator. In terms of the query range, this level might be called the “ideal question” — the question which would bring from the ideal system exactly what the inquirer, if he could state his need. It is the actual, but unexpressed, need for information</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 The conscious mental description of an ill-defined area of in decision. In this level, the inquirer might talk to someone else in the field to get an answer.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 A researcher forms a rational statement of his question. This statement is a rational and unambiguous description of the inquirer’s doubts.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 The question as presented to the information system.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

There are variables within a system that influent the question and its formation. Taylor divided them into five groups: general aspects (physical and geographical factors); system input (What type of material is put into the system, and what is the unit item?); internal organization (classification, indexing, subject heading, and similar access schemes); question input (what part do human operators play in the total system?); output (interim feedback).</p>
<p>

Herbert Menzel preferred demand studies to preference studies. Requests for information or documents that were actually made by scientists in the course of their activities form the data for demand studies. Data may be in the form of records of orders placed for bibliographics, calls for books from an interlibrary loan system, or inquires addressed to an information center or service. Menzel also investigated user study and defined information seeking behaviour from three angles:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 When approached from the point of view of the scientist or technologists, these are studies of scientists’ communication behaviour;</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 When approached from the point of view of any communication medium, they are use studies;</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 When approached from the science communication system, they are studies in the flow of information among scientists and technologists.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

William J. Paisley moved from information needs/uses toward strong guidelines for information system. He studied the theories of information-processing behavior that will generate propositions concerning channel selection; amount of seeking; effects on productivity of information quality, quantity, currency, and diversity; the role of motivational and personality factors, etc. He investigated a concentric conceptual framework for user research. In the framework, he places the information users at the centre of ten systems, which are:

F.J.Devadason and Prataplingam have proposed a methodology for identification of information needs<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-devf.htm">
http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-devf.htm</weblink><weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.kansaslibraryassociation.org/associations/8255/files/KLCIdenInfnNeed.pdf">
http://www.kansaslibraryassociation.org/associations/8255/files/KLCIdenInfnNeed.pdf</weblink>. According to them  the "information needs identifier" should study, prepare and equip him/her-self thoroughly to perform the task of identifying information needs. They have suggested a formal step by step procedure which can be adopted to study the information needs of a majority of users applicable to a majority of situations. The major steps are as follows:</p>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 1) Study of subject(s) of interest to the organization/ Client(s)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 2) Study of the organization and its environment</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 3) Study of the immediate environment of the Client(s)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 4) Study of the Client(s)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 5) Formal interview</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 6) Identification and recording of information needs</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 7) Analysis and refinement of the identified information needs.</entry>
