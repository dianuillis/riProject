The <b>linear no-threshold model</b> (<b>LNT</b>) is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../795/3224795.xml">
model</link> of the damage caused by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/202522.xml">
ionizing radiation</link> which presupposes that the response is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/91591.xml">
linear</link> (i.e., directly proportional to the dose) at all dose levels. Thus LNT asserts that there is no threshold of exposure below which the response ceases to be linear. <p>

The LNT Model stands in contrast to theories in which below a certain level, radiation exposure is harmless - in other words that there is threshold for radiation damage.  (One such alternative model is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/1106101.xml">
radiation hormesis</link>, which asserts that radiation is beneficial in very low doses, while recognizing that it is harmful in large doses.) </p>
<p>

LNT, or at least "no threshold", is sometimes applied to other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link> hazards such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/48230.xml">
polychlorinated biphenyl</link>s in drinking water.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

History</st>
<p>

The linear-no-threshold model was first expressed by <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/1925921.xml">
John Gofman</link></scientist>
, and rejected by the Department of Energy, according to Gofman, because it was "inconvenient".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> The National Association of Sciences Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation report, NAS BEIR VII was the first to clearly state that there is no safe level of radiation, although earlier reports waffled on the issue.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

<p>

If a particular dose of radiation is found to produce one extra case of a type of cancer in every thousand people exposed, the LNTM predicts that one thousandth of this dose will produce one extra case in every million people so exposed, and that one millionth of this dose will produce one extra case in every billion people exposed. This means that any given quantity of radiation will produce the same number of cancers, no matter how thinly it is spread. The model's virtue is its simplicity: a quantity of radiation can be translated into a number of deaths without any adjustment for the distribution.</p>
<p>

The linear no-threshhold model is used to calculate the expected number of extra deaths caused by exposure to environmental radiation, and it therefore has a great impact on public policy. The model allows any radiation release, like that from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/55982.xml">
dirty bomb</link>, to be translated into a number of lives lost, while any reduction in radiation exposure, for example as a consequence of radon detection, can be immediately translated into a number of lives saved. When the doses are low, the model predicts new cancers only in a very small fraction of the population, but for a large population, the number of lives can easily reach hundreds or thousands, and this can sway public policy.</p>
<p>

A linear model has long been used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/545525.xml">
health physics</link> to set maximum acceptable radiation exposures. It was accepted for pragmatic reasons--- it is simple, plausible and predictive. The United States based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/5301431.xml">

, recently released report written by the national experts in the field which states that, radiation's effects should be considered to be proportional to the dose an individual receives, regardless of how small the dose is.</p>

The LNT model for radiation damage is too conservative according to recent work showing that there was a larger than expected reduction in IQ at very low doses from the fallout from Chernobyl, in children who were then fetuses of between 8 and 25 weeks gestation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Neurological damage has a different biology than cancer, and for cancer rates there are conflicting studies.</p>

Controversy</st>

<p>

In recent years, the accuracy of the LNT model at low dosage has been questioned. Many believe that when radiation is distributed thinly enough, so that the levels are comparable to the natural levels, it has no harmful health effects.</p>
<p>

In the scientific community, expert panels are often convened to consider and write reports on the most important and controversial topics of the day. Several of these expert panels have been convened on the topic of the <b>Linear no-threshold model.</b></p>

However, other organisations disagree with using the Linear no-threshold model to estimate risk from environmental and occupational low-level radiation exposure.

) that rejected the Linear no-threshold model in favor of a threshold dose response and a significantly reduced risk at low radiation exposure, they wrote:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> </p>

<p>

In conclusion, this report raises doubts on the validity of using LNT for evaluating the carcinogenic risk of low doses ( 100 mSv) and even more for very low doses ( 10 mSv). The 
LNT concept can be a useful pragmatic tool for assessing rules in  radioprotection for doses 
above 10 mSv;  however since it is not based on biological concepts of our current 
knowledge, it should not be used without precaution for assessing by extrapolation the risks 
associated with low and even more so, with very low doses ( 10 mSv), especially for 
benefit-risk assessments imposed on radiologists by the European directive 97-43.</p>

<p>

The American Nuclear Society position statement regarding the health effects of low-level radiation released in June 2001, states:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>

<p>

It is the position of the American Nuclear Society that there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis (LNTH) in the projection of the health effects of low-level radiation.</p>

<p>

And the Health Physics Society's position statement first adopted in January 1996 and approved following revision in August 2004 by the societies' Health Physics Society, states:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

<p>

In accordance with the current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem in addition to background radiation. Risk estimation in this dose range should be strictly qualitative accentuating a range of hypothetical health outcomes with an emphasis on the likely possibility of zero adverse health effects. The current philosophy of radiation protection is based on the assumption that any radiation dose, no matter how small, may result in human effects, such as cancer and hereditary genetic damage. There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 rem (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.</p>

<p>

Several scientists also disagree with the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis. In the extreme case, some authors promote <process wordnetid="100029677" confidence="0.8">

, the idea that some radiation is good for people. Others simply regard the LNTM as conservative or even completely wrong for predicting the effect of low doses of radiation. As an example, Dr <link>
John DeSesso</link>, academic expert in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/223011.xml">
teratology</link> writes,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> </p>

<p>

When conducting risk assessments, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not currently consider the beneficial effects from exposure to concentrations of agents below the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). If such benefits were observed, and if the beneficial and toxicological mechanisms of action were  identical, this would probably be represented as a ‘j–shaped’ hormetic dose–response curve. If such data are available, they should be considered when assigning uncertainty factors for safe exposure calculations.</p>

<p>

And Dr <link>
Michael Repacholi</link> of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/33583.xml">
World Health Organisation</link> claims that scientists simply guessed that if high-level radiation was dangerous then lower levels would also be hazardous – they made "an assumption".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
