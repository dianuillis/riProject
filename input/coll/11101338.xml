<b>Equiprobability</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/13692155.xml">
philosophical</link> concept in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../542/23542.xml">
probability theory</link> that allows one to assign equal probabilities to outcomes that are judged to be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/11100985.xml">
equipossible</link> or to be "equally likely" (in some sense). The best-known formulation of the rule is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/344783.xml">
Laplace</link>' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/285701.xml">
Principle of Indifference</link>, which states that, when we have no other information than that exactly <it>N</it> events can occur and that they are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../648/312648.xml">
mutually exclusive</link>, we are justified in assigning each the probability 1/<it>N</it>. While this <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/4890.xml">
subjective</link> assignment of probabilities works well for rolling dice and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/228592.xml">
lotteries</link>, it could also lead to the seemly absurd conclusion that the sun is as likely to rise as to not rise tomorrow morning. However, the conclusion that sun is equally likely to rise as it is not rise is only absurd when additional information is known, such as the laws of gravity and the sun's past history. </p>
<p>

Most applications of the concept are effectively applications of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../582/43582.xml">
circular reasoning</link>, with "equally likely" events being assigned equal probabilities, which means in turn that they are equally likely. Despite this, the notion remains useful in probabilistic and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/26685.xml">
statistical</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../795/3224795.xml">
modeling</link>.</p>
