 Dundee Bank of Canada (http://www.dbc.ca) </st>

<p>

Dundee Bank of Canada is a "Schedule I" Canadian chartered bank. In September of 2007 Scotiabank, one of Canada's leading financial institutions purchased Dundee Bank for $260 million. It also purchased a further 18% interest in the parent company, DundeeWealth for $348 million. Some consider this a move by Scotiabank to carry on a full fledged taker over of DundeeWealth in times to come.</p>

<p>

Canada's "big five" banks (Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Canada Trust, Bank of Montreal) are the major Canadian chartered banks classified as "Schedule I". (See http://www.cba.ca/en/section.asp?fl=2&amp;sl=204&amp;tl=&amp;docid= for more information).</p>
