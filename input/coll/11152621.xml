Income support</st>
<p>

All Centrelink Income support payments are payable fortnightly, usually by direct deposit into the recipient's bank account. They are also subject to a means test which calculates the recipient (and their partner's) fortnightly income and assets and affects the rate of their payment accordingly. As such, people on lower incomes may be entitled to part-payment of their allowance (subject to other qualification requirements). The assessment of income and assets is very similar between different social security payments but the effect that income and assets have on each payment differs in that they have different income thresholds (ie how much income one can earn before it affects their payment) and different taper rates (the amount the payment drops by per dollar above these thresholds).</p>

<ss2>
<st>
Age pension</st>
<p>

The Age pension was the first payment issued from the Commonwealth Government and dates back to 1909. It is available to men aged 65 years and over. The age for women to become eligible is being progressively phased upward from 60 to 65 years, in line with males. Women currently become eligible for the Age pension at 63. Unlike pension payments of many other countries, workers do not contribute to a pension or insurance within Australia, and the payment is available subject to means testing. This ensures that only those that require assistance receive it.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Newstart Allowance</st>
<p>

Newstart Allowance is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../430/378430.xml">
unemployment benefit</link> paid in the form of a payment for people between 21 and 64, made when they find themselves unemployed and are seeking work. It is paid on the basis of a mutual agreement between the customer and Centrelink, where Centrelink will continue to pay fortnightly payments to the customer, for so long as the customer attempts to find employment.  As a customer's period of unemployment lengthens, the requirements of Centrelink become more onerous. Customers are required to make up to 10 (Dependent on local labor market) Job Search Contacts per fortnight and record the details of these jobs within a 'Participation Contact Record'.They are required to apply for jobs within different sectors. The customer is obliged to contact a Job Network provider to spend one day a week with them. If the customer remains unemployed then they are subject to more intense voluntary work. A Job Network Provider may require a Newstart recipient to do voluntary work (between 15 to 50 hours) and apply for 4+ positions at the same time to meet their mutual obligations.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Youth Allowance</st>
<p>

Youth Allowance is an income support payment to young Australians in full-time study, an Australian <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/162619.xml">
Apprentice</link>ship, actively looking for employment or undertaking a combination of activities leading to employment. </p>
<p>

'Youth' is defined as 15-24 for full-time students, or 15-20 for job seekers. The payment is only available to dependent children of low-income earners or young people who have met specified independence criteria. Some of the criteria to be considered independent for Youth Allowance purposes include young people who:</p>
<p>

•  have self supporting themselves through paid work, or
•  are, or have been in a marriage like relationship, or
•  have, or have had, a dependent child, or
•  are an orphan or refugee without parents in Australia, or
•  are unable to live with parents due to relationship breakdown or because the parent is incarcerated or missing.</p>
<p>

Young people can gain independence through other criteria, and each criteria has specific conditions that are required to be met, before the independent status can be gained.</p>
<p>

The underlying philosophy of Youth Allowance is that parents are responsible for supporting their children where they have the means and the young person has not lived independently from them. 15 year olds can only receive Youth Allowance if they are defined as independent and are over the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/11029259.xml">

<p>

Youth Allowance is subject to a number of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../905/1157905.xml">
means test</link>s. Independent Youth Allowance recipients are subject only to the personal (and partner where applicable) income and assets test. Dependent Youth Allowance recipients are subject to the personal income test. A dependent Youth Allowance recipient can never be a member of a couple, although being married or a member of a de facto couple for a period of usually 12 months will make the person independent,  so a partner's means will not affect entitlement.  They are also subject to the parental income test and family assets test unless a parent is in receipt of a specified income support payment themselves. They may also be subject to the Family Actual Means Test (FAMT) which applies where the parent is self employed, involved in a <volition wordnetid="105652593" confidence="0.8">

</volition>
 or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/4918223.xml">
company</link> or several other categories. The rationale behind the FAMT is that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/3147513.xml">
taxable income</link> on which Youth Allowance is normally based may not accurately reflect the true financial means of parents in these categories. It asks for details of the family's spending on living expenses during the relevant tax year and extrapolates an equivalent notional taxable income from this. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../326/668326.xml">
Sole traders</link> involved in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../303/208303.xml">

<p>

Youth Allowance was introduced from July <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/34647.xml">
1998</link> and replaced Youth Training Allowance and Newstart Allowance for job seekers under 21 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/10009165.xml">
AUSTUDY</link> for students under 25.</p>

</ss2>

Austudy Payment</st>
<p>

<link>
Austudy Payment</link> was originally known as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/10009165.xml">
AUSTUDY</link> Scheme, an all-ages study allowance, but since the introduction of Youth Allowance (see above) it has been reserved for the over 25s. To qualify, one must be an Australian resident, over 25, and studying full time at an approved education institution. However, students who were receiving Youth Allowance prior to turning 25 and are still pursuing the same course of study continue to receive Youth Allowance until they finish (or otherwise terminate) their course. </p>
<p>

Unlike Youth Allowance, Austudy customers are considered to be independent and are not subject to the Parental Income Test, Family Assets Test and the Family Actual Means Test.  As part of the 2007 Federal Budget Announcement on 8th May 2007 <link>
Austudy Payment</link> recipients are eligible for Rent Assistance from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../787/15787.xml">

1 January</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/35825.xml">
2008</link>, Rent Assistance was not payable with Austudy.  Like most Centrelink payments, Austudy Payment is subject to a personal and/or partner income and assets test.</p>

 Study Assistance Scheme) is a welfare payment for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/2912594.xml">
Indigenous Australians</link> undergoing some form of study. All Indigenous students at secondary or tertiary institutions, as well as those studying by correspondence, and primary students who turned 14 prior to January 1 of their current year of study. To qualify as Indigenous, a student must be of Aboriginal or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../809/595809.xml">
Torres Strait Islander</link> descent by Centrelink standards and be a current Australian citizen. <link>
ABSTUDY</link> is tailored according to income tests, and the status of partners, guardians, and dependent children.</p>
<p>

Whilst this payment is administered through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/962169.xml">
Centrelink</link>, the payment is made under <link>
ABSTUDY</link> Policy.  The responsibility for <link>

Disability Support Pension</st>
<p>

Provides income support for people who suffer a long-term disability, which in the opinion of an assessor they will not recover from in the next two years, and which will render themselves unable to work or participate in a training activity enabling them to work. It is more than you get on Newstart, and is income and assets-tested. However, if you are permanently blind, you can receive DSP without income and assets tests, and without needing to prove any inability to work, etc. DSP can take a while to process, so as a temporary measure claimants are placed on another payment (e.g. Newstart with a medical certificate to cover the activity tests) while the payment is being assessed; once granted it is backdated to the claim date at the higher DSP rate.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Sickness Allowance</st>
<p>

A payment for those who are currently suffering an Illness / Injury / Disability (Short Term ie. less than 2 years), are employed, and have no access to leave or have used all their leave. Paid Under the Newstart System without an Activity Test.</p>

<p>

A payment for those providing full time care to someone who is ill, injured or has a disability.</p>

<st>
Parenting Payment</st>
<p>

A payment for those who are principal carers of dependent children under the age of 6 for partnered customers and children under the age of 8 for single customers granted payments after 1 July 2006.  Those customers granted Parenting Payment prior to 1 July 2006 are eligible to remain on the Parenting Payment until their youngest child turns 16 with compulsory participation requirements from 1 July 2007 or when their youngest child turns 7, whichever occurs later.  Parenting Payment Partnered is classified as an allowance and Parenting Payment Single is classified as a pension. </p>
<p>

Parenting Payment Partnered uses an individual and a partner income test to determine the rate of payment with benefit withdrawal rates of 60 cents in the dollar (as of 1 July 2007) on income over the legislated limits. A partner's gross earnings are assessed as shared, regardless of individual tax already paid. If, for example, the breadwinner is currently paying 30 per cent personal tax, the   <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../824/782824.xml">
effective marginal tax rate</link> (EMTR) after benefit withdrawal is 90 percent of earnings above the legislated limit (the EMTR prior to 1 July 2007 is 100% as the benefit withdrawal rate is 70% of the partner's earnings above the legislated income limit).</p>

<st>
Pensioner Education Supplement</st>
<p>

An additional payment, for those on a pension who are studying, to help cover the cost of study. It only applies to approved courses of study. Bachelor's degrees and many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../386/31386.xml">
TAFE</link> courses are approved courses of study, but generally postgraduate study is not. You are still eligible for PES for study even if you have completed previous studies.</p>

Family Tax benefit</st>
<p>

Family Tax Benefit is a payment made, through the tax system, to the caretakers of children. Entitlement to this benefit is based on the family's taxable income in the given financial year. Payment can be made after a person has lodged a tax return or in advance based on an estimate of taxable income during the financial year. If payments are received in advance, they are reconciled at the end of the financial year when the amount received is compared to the amount that should have been received based on actual income according to tax returns.</p>
<p>

Family tax benefit part A is paid based on the combined taxable income of the recipient and their partner (if applicable). Family Tax benefit Part B is paid based on the lower of the recipient and their partner's income, or, for a single parent, at the highest rate.</p>

 Review of Social Security Decisions </st>
<p>

Every decision made under social security law is to be in writing and given sufficient notice, usually in a letter.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Applications for review of such decisions may be lodged at any time, but depending on the decision remedial action may only be taken if the review is received within 13 weeks of receiving notice, for decisions made under the Social Security act, or 52 weeks for decisions made under Family assistance law. At the bottom of each letter informing customers of a Centrelink decision, a “your rights” box informs individuals of potential avenues for review. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Internal Review </st>
<p>

Legislation ultimately governs the decision making process, and Centrelink policy guidelines provide the lens through which legislation is interpreted by Centrelink Customer Service Advisers (CSAs). However, notwithstanding legislation and policy, there are still many areas in which significant discretion is afforded to the decision maker, which may be subject to internal and external review.</p>

<ss2>
<st>
Original Decision Maker (ODM) Review</st>
<p>

Centrelink possesses a prescribed two-tiered system of internal review. The initial stage is the ODM Review, where the matter is brought back to the CSA for reconsideration.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> This is a wholly intra-office process and functions as an initial check on the decision, and the appeal progresses further from the ODM only if necessary. Many reviews are due to legislative changes, administrative errors, provision of new customer documentation, or customer disagreement with the decision. There is also the opportunity for the customer to make a formal written complaint. However, many individuals may not wish to have the same CSA make another decision, which may even lead to confusion as to whether internal review has actually taken place.  </p>
<p>

Once the ODM review has been completed it should contain the relevant legislative provisions, any new information considered, and a determination stating whether the original decision has been set aside, affirmed or varied. </p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Authorised Review Officer (ARO) Review</st>
<p>

If the individual is not satisfied, an Authorised Review Officer (ARO), an officer delegated review powers from the Secretary for the purposes of social security law, may affirm, vary, or set aside the original decision.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Although an employee of the Centrelink, an ARO is not to defend ODM decisions as it is a strong principle that the ARO is independent of the situation and has no previous involvement in the case. Nevertheless, AROs also look at legislation with the same policy guidelines as CSAs.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
The Social Security Appeals Tribunal – SSAT</st>
<p>

A customer dissatisfied with an internal review of a decision may apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> to review a decision affirmed, varied or set aside by internal review,  subject to some exceptions. The SSAT generally has the same powers as the Secretary, and may affirm, vary, set aside and substitute a decision or return the matter to Centrelink with recommendations. SSAT hearings are generally informal, confidential and not bound by  the Laws of Evidence.  </p>
<p>

Experience has indicated that at the SSAT more weighting goes towards the legislation as opposed to policy guidelines. Welfare advocacy groups such as the Welfare Rights Centre are often involved in providing legal help to individuals affected by Centrelink decisions.</p>

</ss2>
</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 External Review </st>

<ss2>
<st>
The AAT and the Courts</st>
<p>

Further appeals (on questions of law only) are available to the Federal Court and High Court.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> A decision must have been reviewed by the SSAT before it can be heard at the AAT. However, the Secretary or a delegated person on behalf of the Secretary may appeal a decision from the SSAT. Only 17% of decisions are overturned at the AAT . Further appeal is available to the Federal Court and High Court but on questions of law only.</p>

Where the Ombudsman concludes that there has been a deficiency in Centrelink's action (for examples <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>) the Ombudsman may make recommendations to Centrelink for remedial action. This may result in Centrelink changing their decision, or providing a better explanation of their decision.</p>
<p>

Investigations by the Ombudsman are usually result from a complaint about a decision or action of Centrelink, and in the process of an investigation the Ombudsman is entitled to view Centrelink records and ask questions of Centrelink staff. While the Ombudsman does not have coercive powers to make Centrelink change a decision or act in a certain way, recommendations made by the Ombudsman are rarely rejected.</p>
