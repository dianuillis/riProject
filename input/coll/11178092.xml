<b>Harshness</b> (also called <b>raucousness</b>), in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/261193.xml">
music information retrieval</link>, is a Non-Contextual Low-Level Audio Descriptors (NLDs) that represents one dimension of the multi-dimensional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../448/24448.xml">
psychoacoustic</link> feature called as musical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/77892.xml">
timbre</link>.<p>

Classical timbreâ€™ NLDs are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/2260140.xml">
roughness</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/10930578.xml">
spectral centroid</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/7257044.xml">
spectral flux</link>. While harmonicity and inharmonicity can also be considered NLDs, harshness differs from them, as well as from roughness, once it reckons for a distinguished perceptual audio feature expressed by the summary spectral periodicity. This feature is especially clear in single-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/77933.xml">
pitch</link>, single-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../026/22026.xml">
note</link>, musical audio, where the timbre of two different musical instruments can greatly differ in levels of harshness (e.g., the difference in harshness between a flute and a saxophone is evident). As it is supposed to be, harshness is independent of all others NLDs.</p>
