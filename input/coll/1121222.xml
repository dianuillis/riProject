<b>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing</b> (<b>EMDR</b>) is a form of psychotherapy that was developed to resolve symptoms resulting from disturbing and unresolved life experiences. It uses a structured approach to address past, present, and future aspects of disturbing memories.  The approach was  developed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/5891226.xml">
Francine Shapiro</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> to resolve the development of trauma-related disorders as resulting from exposure to a traumatic or distressing event, such as rape. Clinical trials have demonstrated EMDR's efficacy in the treatment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/82974.xml">
post-traumatic stress disorder</link> (PTSD).  In some studies it has been shown to be equivalent to cognitive behavioral and exposure therapies, and more effective than some alternative treatments (see effectiveness sections below). However, the effectiveness of the mechanisms behind EMDR have been questioned, with most leading researchers concluding that cognitive restructuring (which is common in most therapies for PTSD), rather than the eye movements, are responsible for change. Although some clinicians may use EMDR for various problems, its research support is primarily for disorders stemming from distressing life experiences.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

 Mechanism </st>
<p>

The theoretical model underlying EMDR treatment hypothesizes that EMDR works by processing distressing memories.  EMDR is based on a theoretical information processing model which posits that symptoms arise when events are inadequately processed, and can be eradicated when the memory is fully processed. It is an integrative therapy, synthesizing elements of many traditional psychological orientations, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/4254735.xml">
psychodynamic</link>, cognitive behavioral, experiential, physiological, and interpersonal therapies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> </p>
<p>

EMDR's most unique aspect is an unusual component of bilateral stimulation of the brain, such as eye movements, bilateral sound, or bilateral tactile stimulation coupled with cognitions, visualized images and body sensation. EMDR also utilizes dual attention awareness to allow the individual to vacillate between the traumatic material and the safety of the present moment. This prevents retraumatization from exposure to the disturbing memory. As EMDR is an integrative therapy which combines elements of cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic therapies to desensitize traumatic memories, some individuals have criticized EMDR and consider the use of eye movements to be an unnecessary component of treatment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> However, recent studies have examined the effects of eye movements and have found that eye movements in EMDR decrease the vividness and/or negative emotions associated with autobiographical memories,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> enhance the retrieval of episodic memories,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> increase cognitive flexibility,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> and correlate with decreases in heart rate, skin conductance, and an increased finger temperature.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref>  These physiological changes associated with EMDR are consistent with earlier research on physiological changes associated with EMDR.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>  Also recent studies that have removed eye movement from the method have found the procedure less effective.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>

 Description of therapy </st>

<p>

There are two perspectives on EMDR therapy.  One was advanced by the method's creator, with a theory that eye movements provide some neurological and psychological effects that enhance the processing of traumatic memories.  The other perspective is that eye movements are an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/59604.xml">
epiphenomenon</link>, unnecessary, and that EMDR is simply a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/249937.xml">
desensitization</link>.  </p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Theoretical basis </st>

<p>

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) has been used to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It integrates elements of imaginal exposure, cognitive therapy, psychodynamic and somatic therapies.  It also uses the unique and somewhat controversial element of bilateral stimulation (e.g. moving the eyes back and forth). According to Francine Shapiro's theory, when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm usual ways of coping and the memory of the event is inadequately processed; the memory is dysfunctionally stored in an isolated memory network.  When this memory network is activated, the individual may re-experience aspects of the original event, often resulting in inappropriate overreactions. This explains why people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic incident may have recurring sensory flashbacks, thoughts, beliefs, or dreams.  An unprocessed memory of a traumatic event can retain high levels of sensory and emotional intensity, even though many years may have passed.</p>
<p>

EMDR uses a structured eight-phase approach and addresses the past, present, and future aspects of the dysfunctionally stored memory. During the processing phases of EMDR, the client attends to the disturbing memory in multiple brief sets of about 15-30 seconds, while simultaneously focusing on the dual attention stimulus (e.g., therapist-directed lateral eye movements, alternate hand-tapping, or bilateral auditory tones).  Following each set of such dual attention, the client is asked what associative information was elicited during the procedure.  This new material usually becomes the focus of the next set.  This process of alternating dual attention and personal association is repeated many times during the session.  </p>
<p>

The theory is that EMDR works directly with memory networks and enhances information processing by forging associations between the distressing memory and more adaptive information contained in other semantic memory networks.  It is thought that the distressing memory is transformed when new connections are forged with more positive and realistic information.  This results in a transformation of the emotional, sensory, and cognitive components of the memory so that, when it is accessed, the individual is no longer distressed.  Instead he/she recalls the incident with a new perspective, new insight, resolution of the cognitive distortions, elimination of emotional distress, and relief of related physiological arousal.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
<p>

When the distressing or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/13572369.xml">
traumatic event</link> is an isolated incident, the symptoms can often be cleared with one to three EMDR sessions.  But when multiple traumatic events contribute to a health problem - such as physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, parental neglect, severe illness, accident, injury, or health-related trauma that result in chronic impairment to health and well-being - the time to heal may be longer.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>

 Therapy process </st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase I:</b> In the first sessions, the patient's history and an overall treatment plan are discussed. During this process the therapist identifies and clarifies potential targets for EMDR. Target refers to a disturbing issue, event, feeling, or memory for use as an initial focus for EMDR. Maladaptive beliefs are also identified. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase II:</b> Before beginning EMDR for the first time, it is recommended that the client identify a safe place, an image or memory that elicits comfortable feelings and a positive sense of self. This safe place can be used later to bring closure to an incomplete session or to help a client tolerate a particularly upsetting session. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase III:</b> In developing a target for EMDR, prior to beginning the eye movements, a snapshot image is identified that represents the target and the disturbance associated with it. Using that image is a way to help the client focus on the target, a negative cognition (NC) is identified - a negative statement about the self that feels especially true when the client focuses on the target image. A positive cognition (PC) is also identified - a positive self-statement that is preferable to the negative cognition. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase IV:</b> The therapist asks the patient to focus simultaneously on the image, the negative cognition, and the disturbing emotion or body sensation. Then the therapist usually asks the client to follow a moving object with his or her eyes; the object moves alternately from side to side so that the client's eyes also move back and forth. After a set of eye movements, the client is asked to report briefly on what has come up; this may be a thought, a feeling, a physical sensation, an image, a memory, or a change in any one of the above. In the initial instructions to the client, the therapist asks him or her to focus on this thought, and begins a new set of eye movements. Under certain conditions, however, the therapist directs the client to focus on the original target memory or on some other image, thought, feeling, fantasy, physical sensation, or memory. From time to time the therapist may query the client about her or his current level of distress. The desensitization phase ends when the SUDS (Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale) has reached 0 or 1.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase V:</b> The "Installation Phase": the therapist asks the client about the positive cognition, if it's still valid. After Phase IV, the view of the client on the event/ the initial snapshot image may have changed dramatically. Another PC may be needed. Then the client is asked to "hold together" the snapshot and the (new) PC. Also the therapist asks, "How valid does the PC feel, on a scale from 0 to 7?" New sets of eye movement are issued.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase VI:</b>  The body scan: the therapist asks if anywhere in the client's body any pain, stress or discomfort is felt. If so, the client is asked to concentrate on the sore knee or whatever may arise and new sets are issued.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Phase VII:</b> Debriefing. The therapist gives appropriate info and support.</entry>

EMDR also uses a three-pronged approach, to address past, present and future aspects of the targeted memory.</p>

 Empirical evidence </st>
<p>

Over the last 18 years evidence has accumulated that supports EMDR as an effective treatment for problems associated with distressing memories that relate to the experience of a negative/traumatic event.  The evidence about whether EMDR is effective will be first considered on the basis of what scientific committees from around the world have concluded, then EMDR will be compared to typical treatments, medication and traditional exposure based treatments.  Although, as discussed below, EMDR is generally considered an efficacious treatment for the treatment of trauma, the working mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of EMDR, and whether the eye movement component in EMDR contributes to its clinical effectiveness it still a point of uncertainty and contentious debate. </p>
<p>

<b>Effectiveness: Conclusions from international scientific committees</b>
Based on the evidence of controlled research both the practice guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> and the Department of Veterans Affairs and Defense<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> have placed EMDR in the highest category of effectiveness and research support in the treatment of trauma. This status is reflected in a number of international guidelines where EMDR is a recommended treatment for trauma<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref></p>
<p>

<b>Effectiveness: EMDR compared to typical treatments</b>
EMDR has been demonstrated to have significant advantages over usual treatment for PTSD in an HMO setting, and improvement was maintained at a six month follow-up.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref>  EMDR has been shown to be effective on measures of trauma, depression and anxiety in women who had been sexually abused as children.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref></p>
<p>

<b>Effectiveness: EMDR compared to medication</b>
To date EMDR has only been compared directly to medication in one study. Van der Kolk et al. found EMDR to be more effective than <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../680/10153680.xml">
fluoxetine</link>, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/29581.xml">
SSRI</link> in treating trauma, especially six months post-treatment. The study also suggests a role for SSRIs as a reliable first-line intervention.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref></p>
<p>

<b>Effectiveness: EMDR versus traditional exposure treatments (studies in the last 5 years)</b>
EMDR proved significantly better than stress inoculation training with prolonged exposure in a study with 24 participants diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref> Although reduction in symptom severity was equivalent post treatment, at follow-up, EMDR lead to greater gains on both self report and observer rated measures of PTSD and self report measures of depression.  In another study of 22 participants who had also been diagnosed with PTSD, both EMDR and prolonged exposure were found to be effective post treatment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref>  Participants receiving EMDR appeared to improve quicker in that 70% had reached a level of clinically significant improvement in PTSD after three EMDR sessions compared to only 17% in the prolonged exposure condition.  
EMDR was also found to work more quickly than exposure based treatments in a larger trial with 105 participants.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> At a fifteen-month follow-up, gains for both treatments were generally maintained. The only significant difference at follow-up was an improvement in depression according to an independent observer in favour of EMDR.
EMDR and Prolonged Exposure (PE) were found to be equivalently efficacious and both superior to a waitlist control in a controlled trial of 74 female rape victims.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref>  Measures used by blind assessors included PTSD, depression, dissociation and state anxiety.  Unlike other studies noted above, there was no difference between the active treatments in rate of improvement. However EMDR seemed to do adequately well despite utilising no homework tasks and less exposure.  The study met the highest criteria for methodological rigour proposed by Foa and Meadows.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref>

However there were no differences between the two treatments in the intent to treat analysis and no differences between the two treatments on percentage of people with PTSD diagnosis at follow-up.</p>
<p>

<b>Effectiveness: meta-analysis </b>
EMDR was found in the first ever meta-analysis of PTSD to be equally effective as exposure therapy and SSRIs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref> Two recent meta-analyses concluded that traditional exposure therapy and EMDR have equivalent effects both immediately after treatment and at follow-up.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref>The most recent meta-analysis looked at 38 randomized controlled trials for PTSD treatment and concluded that the first-line psychological treatment for PTSD should be Trauma-Focused CBT or EMDR.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref></p>

 Other applications </st>

<p>

Although controlled research has concentrated on the application of EMDR to PTSD, a number of studies have investigated EMDR’s efficacy with other anxiety disorders as well as numerous reports of diverse clinical applications.  </p>
<p>

Case reports have been published on the application of EMDR to the treatment of (a) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/199054.xml">
personality disorders</link> ( Fensterheim, 1996a; Korn &amp; Leeds, in press; Manfield, 1998), (b) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/2413401.xml">
dissociative disorders</link> ( Fine &amp; Berkowitz, 2001; Lazrove &amp; Fine, 1996; Paulsen, 1995; Twombly, 2000), ( c ) a variety of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/57688.xml">
anxiety disorders</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref> ( De Jongh &amp; Ten Broeke, 1998; Goldstein &amp; Feske, 1994; Lovett, 199; Nadler, 1996; Shapiro &amp; Forrest, 1997) and (d) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../328/3040328.xml">
somatoform disorders</link> ( Brown, Mcgoldrick, &amp; Buchanan, 1997; Grant &amp; Threlfo, 2002).  However, controlled research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of these applications.</p>
<p>

In designing the research the entire EMDR protocol should be evaluated within the context of the potential special needs of the particular population.  For instance, Brown et al. (1997) evaluated the application of EMDR in seven consecutive cases of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/369730.xml">
Body Dysmorphic Disorder</link> (BDD), which has been reported to necessitate 8 to 20 sessions of cognitive behavior therapy with varying success rates ( Neziroglu, McKay, Todaro, &amp; Yaryura-Tobias, 1996; Beale et al., 1996; Wilhelm, Otto, Lohr, &amp; Deckersbach, 1999).  In contrast, Brown et al. reported the elimination of BDD in five of the seven consecutive cases in one to three sessions of EMDR through the processing of the etiological memory.  While this result indicates the EMDR holds promise for the treatment of this disorder, future controlled research should include a greater number of sessions in order to evaluate the more comprehensive clinical picture.  </p>
<p>

EMDR can work on a multitude of problems that are less complex than PTSD.  One of these is uncomplicated depression.  The EMDR Casebook by Philip Manfield, PH.D. has documented several case studies in which EMDR was used.  In the case about uncomplicated depression, Manfield was able to help his client, George, resolve several childhood issues that have plagued his adult life. Moreover, EMDR can work for diseases such as postpartum depression.  By having the client target a distinctive memory and work through it with a series of eye movements, the client is then able to achieve a positive cognition.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref></p>
<p>

EMDR has been used on children to treat a variety of conditions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2244%22])">44</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref>

<p>

There is no definitive explanation as to how EMDR works.  There is some empirical support for three explanations regarding how an external stimulus such as eye movement can facilitate the processing of traumatic memories.   </p>
<p>

The first hypothesis views PTSD as a failure by the individual to process episodic memory;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2247%22])">47</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref> the bilateral eye movements involved in EMDR facilitate interaction between the brain's hemispheres, which then improves the processing of trauma-related memories.  This hypothesis is supported by a study that tested the effects of eye movement on the ability to retrieve episodic memory. The study found better recall following a horizontal eye movement task compared to that following no eye movement or a vertical eye movement task.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2249%22])">49</ref></p>
<p>

A second hypothesis suggests that eye movements facilitate processing of trauma memories by activating a neurobiological state similar to REM sleep wherein associative links to episodic memories are formed and these memories are then integrated into general semantic networks.  Stickgold proposed that PTSD occurs when an event is sufficiently arousing to prevent its transfer from encoding from an episodic memory to a semantic memory.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref> As a result of high arousal levels, associations between the traumatic event and other related events fail to develop. He argues that the attentional redirecting in EMDR induces a neurobiological state similar to REM sleep.  He then reviews the research that suggests that REM sleep enhances processing of episodic memory through the preferential activation of weak associative and semantic links. Thus in EMDR trauma-related information that is closely associated with a target event is weakened and ancillary information loosely related to the event is strengthened, allowing the integration of trauma-related material with other loosely associated events in the person’s life.  Support for this argument comes from a study that found that, compared to eye fixation, eye movement promoted attentional flexibility and increased preparedness to process metaphorical material.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2250%22])">50</ref></p>
<p>

A third hypothesis links the eye movements in EMDR with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../378/1563378.xml">
orienting response</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2251%22])">51</ref>  MacCulloch and Feldman argued that eye movements trigger the investigation component of the orienting response, which can either produce avoidance behaviour or inhibit avoidance responses.  Inhibiting avoidance behaviour includes reducing both negative somatic responses and cognitive changes that would allow fresh investigatory behaviour to commence. MacCulloch and Feldman proposed that initially when danger is identified there is a negative affect response. However a second part of the orienting response is to scan for further danger, and this investigatory reflex seems to accompany a positive physical response. In the authors’ opinion, eye movement induces this investigatory reflex and produces a relaxation response. A relaxation response was, in fact, found in a study that investigated the autonomic responses of participants when they were engaged in an eye movement task as part of EMDR treatment<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2252%22])">52</ref> and when participants focused on negative memories while engaging in eye movement [23].  However there is not a differential effect of eye movement on a relaxation response when participants focused on positive memories.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2253%22])">53</ref> This supports the hypothesis that eye movements are an orienting response mechanism rather than a simple relaxation mechanism. In addition, recent research that has examined the physiological correlates of eye movements in EMDR has found that a clear orienting response pattern of psycho-physiological de-arousal occurs when eye movements begin, and this de-arousal is characteristic of the physiological changes that occur when an orienting response is elicited.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2254%22])">54</ref>  </p>
<p>

Further data consistent with the orienting response hypothesis was the finding that EMDR treatment was associated with increased left pre-frontal hemisphere activation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2255%22])">55</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2256%22])">56</ref> Investigatory and approach behavior has been shown to be associated with the anterior left hemisphere regions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2257%22])">57</ref></p>

 Controversy </st>

<p>

EMDR has generated a great deal of controversy since its inception. Critics of EMDR argue that the eye movements do not play a central role, that the mechanisms of eye movements are speculative, and that the theory leading to the practice is not falsifiable and amenable to scientific enquiry.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2258%22])">58</ref></p>
<p>

Although one meta-analysis concluded that EMDR is not as effective, or as long lasting, as specific exposure therapy,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2259%22])">59</ref> several other researchers using meta-analyses have found EMDR to be at least equivalent in effect size to specific exposure therapies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2260%22])">60</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2261%22])">61</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2262%22])">62</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2263%22])">63</ref></p>

 Eye movements </st>
<p>

An early critical review and metanalysis that looked at the contribution of eye movements to treatment effectiveness in EMDR concluded that eye movements are not necessary to the treatment effect.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2264%22])">64</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2265%22])">65</ref> However, recent research has demonstrated that when the eye movement component of EMDR is removed from the method the procedure is less effective.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2266%22])">66</ref> This finding supports previous research that has demonstrated that EMDR with eye movements is more effective than treatment conditions that do not utilise eye movements in the method,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2267%22])">67</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2268%22])">68</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2269%22])">69</ref> or instead use a dual attention task such as tapping.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2270%22])">70</ref></p>
<p>

MacCulloch (2006) argued that the eye movements make a unique contribution to EMDR,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2271%22])">71</ref> whereas Salkovskis (2002) reported that the eye movements are irrelevant and that the effectiveness of the procedure is solely due to it sharing similar properties to cognitive behavioral therapies, such as desensitization and exposure.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2272%22])">72</ref></p>

<st>
 Effect of eye movements on memory, cognitive processes, and physiology </st>
<p>

Although the necessity of eye movements in EMDR is still a point of controversy and contentious debate, a separate body of research has examined what effects eye movements have on physiology, memory, and cognition during the process of EMDR. To date the research in this area has demonstrated that eye movements decrease the vividness and/or emotional valence of autobiographical memories,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2273%22])">73</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2274%22])">74</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2275%22])">75</ref> they enhance the retrieval of episodic memories,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2276%22])">76</ref> produce a physiological relaxation effect, similar to that which is characteristically seen when an orienting response is elicited,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2277%22])">77</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2278%22])">78</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2279%22])">79</ref> and they have been found to increase cognitive flexibility.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2280%22])">80</ref>  Although a wide range of researchers have proposed various models and theories to explain the effect of eye movements, and the possible role that eye movements may play in the process of EMDR, to date, no single model or theory exists that can explain all of the above mentioned findings.  Further research is therefore required in this area.</p>

 Similarity to desensitization and exposure treatments </st>
<p>

Several papers have highlighted key differences between EMDR and traditional exposure treatments.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2281%22])">81</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2282%22])">82</ref>  A recent study has found key differences in the crucial processes of EMDR and traditional exposure.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2283%22])">83</ref>  Unlike traditional exposure where reliving responses in the treatment session was found to be associated with post session improvement,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2284%22])">84</ref> reliving responses were not associated with any improvement in EMDR.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2285%22])">85</ref>  Instead, greater improvement in PTSD symptoms was found to be associated with distancing responses&#91;&#93; given in session.</p>
