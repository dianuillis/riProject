History</st>

<p>

Petronas was not the first company to extract oil or gas in Malaysia. Oil was first found in what is now Malaysia at the end of the 19th century, and in 1910 Royal Dutch/ Shell, then as now one of the majors—the small group of leading private oil companies—first drilled for oil in Sarawak, then a British colony. It was still the only oil company in the area in 1963, when the <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/304150.xml">

, having achieved independence from Britain six years before, absorbed Sarawak and Sabah, both on the island of Borneo, and became <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/3607937.xml">

. The authorities in the two new states retained their links with <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../417/59417.xml">

, which brought Malaysia's first offshore oil field onstream in 1968.</p>
<p>

Meanwhile the federal government turned to Esso, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/319730.xml">

, and Mobil, licensing exploration off the state of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/376431.xml">
Terengganu</link>, in the Malay Peninsula, the most populous region and the focus of federal power. By 1974, however, only <oil_company wordnetid="108069241" confidence="0.8">

 was still in the area. It made its first discoveries of natural gas in that year and then rapidly made <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/376431.xml">
Terengganu</link> a bigger producer of oil than either <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/28258.xml">
Sarawak</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/28678.xml">
Sabah</link>. By 1974, Malaysia's output of crude oil stood at about 81,000&nbsp;barrels per day (12,900&nbsp;m³/d). </p>

Setting Up a State Company: 1970s</st>

<p>

Several factors converged in the early 1970s to prompt the Malaysian government into setting up a state oil and gas company, as first proposed in its Five Year Plan published in 1971. These were years in which power in the world oil industry began to shift away from the majors, which then controlled more than 90% of the oil trade, toward the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/166346.xml">
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/166346.xml">
OPEC</link>), as well as a proliferation of new private and state companies joining in the search for reserves. By 1985, the majors, reduced in number from seven to five, were producing less than 20% of the world total. It seemed that <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/3607937.xml">
Malaysia</link></country>
 would either have to join the trend or continue to leave its oil and gas entirely to Royal Dutch/Shell and Esso, multinational corporations necessarily attuned to the requirements of their directors and shareholders, rather than to the priorities the government of a developing country might seek to realize.</p>
<p>

Further, an agreement between <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/3607937.xml">
Malaysia</link></country>
 and <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../579/14579.xml">

, signed in 1969, had settled doubts and disputes about each country's claims over territorial waters and offshore resources at a time when both were heavily indebted to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/178735.xml">
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../793/493793.xml">
OECD</link>) governments and banks as well as to the <central_bank wordnetid="108349916" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/15251.xml">

 (IMF) and the <institute wordnetid="108407330" confidence="0.8">
<association wordnetid="108049401" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/33309.xml">
World Bank</link></association>
</institute>
. Setting up a state oil and gas company, through which the government could get international capital but avoid tangling with foreign oil companies or governments, had worked for Indonesia: why not for Malaysia as well? The oil crisis of 1973–74 made the government even more aware of Malaysia's dependence on foreign oil and foreign capital in general.</p>
<p>

Another factor in the decision was that the technology had recently been developed for extensive exploration and drilling offshore. The local geography included a combination of broad basins of sedimentary rock with calm and shallow waters around the Sunda Shelf, making exploration for gas and oil relatively easier and more successful than in most areas of the world. Malaysian crude turned out to be mostly high quality with low sulfur content.</p>
<p>

A final and crucial factor in the creation of Petronas, and its continuation in much the same form since, has been the political stability of Malaysia. Since the restoration of parliament in 1971, the country has been ruled by the National Front (<party wordnetid="108256968" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/126544.xml">
Barisan Nasional</link></party>
), the heirs to the Alliance Party which had been dominant from 1957 to 1969 and the originators in 1971 of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/184407.xml">
New Economic Policy</link>, which was designed to improve the economic position of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/106544.xml">
Bumiputras</link>—native Malays—relative to Chinese and Indian Malaysians and to foreign corporations. The difficulties this policy has caused for foreign companies and investors are outweighed by the benefits they believe they gain from Malaysia's political stability.</p>
<p>

The Malaysian government chose to create a state company, rather than using taxes, production limits, leasing, or other familiar instruments of supervision. The government wanted, and needed, the cooperation of the majors but also sought to assert national rights over the use of the country's resources. A state company, having both supervisory powers over the majors and production activities of its own, was a workable compromise between allowing the majors full rein and excluding them, along with their capital and expertise, altogether.</p>
<p>

Petronas was established in August 1974 and operates under the terms of the Petroleum Development Act passed in October 1974. It was modeled on <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/4042974.xml">
PERTAMINA</link></company>
, the Indonesian state oil and gas company founded in 1971 in succession to <link>
PERMINA</link>, which had been set up in 1958. According to the 1971 plan, Petronas's goals would be to safeguard national sovereignty over oil and gas reserves, to plan for both present and future national need for oil and gas, to take part in distributing and marketing petroleum and petrochemical products at reasonable prices, to encourage provision of plant, equipment, and services by Malaysian companies, to produce nitrogenous fertilizers, and to spread the benefits of the petroleum industry throughout the nation.</p>
<p>

Having created Petronas, the government had to choose what forms its dealings with private oil companies would take. Starting with its legal monopoly on oil and gas activities and resources, it had several options: it could simply award concessions without taking part in production, management, or profits; it could try offering services at the supply end; or it could make contracts to cover profit-sharing, production-sharing, joint ventures—sharing both profits and costs—or all stages of the process, under "carried-interest" contracts. Petronas's first move was to negotiate the replacement of the leases granted to Royal Dutch/Shell on Borneo and to <oil_company wordnetid="108069241" confidence="0.8">

 in the Peninsula with production-sharing contracts, which have been the favored instrument, alongside joint ventures, ever since. These first contracts came into effect in 1976. Allowing for royalties to both federal and state governments, and for cost recovery arrangements, they laid down that the remainder would go 70% to Petronas and 30% to the foreign company. <oil_company wordnetid="108069241" confidence="0.8">

 began oil production in two offshore fields in 1978, exporting its share of the supply, unlike Petronas, whose share was consumed within the country.</p>
<p>

Petronas went downstream for the first time in 1976, when it was chosen by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/106539.xml">
Association of South East Asian Nations</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/106539.xml">
ASEAN</link>) to begin construction on the second ASEAN joint industrial project, a urea plant. The subsidiary, <link>
Asean Bintulu Fertilizer</link> (ABF), is based in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/28258.xml">
Sarawak</link> and now exports <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/1365.xml">
ammonia</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/31734.xml">
urea</link> all over the world.</p>
<p>

Also in 1976, Malaysia became a net exporter of oil, but exports were at such a low level as to make the country ineligible to join <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/166346.xml">
OPEC</link>. This situation benefited Malaysia, and Petronas, by allowing the company a degree of commercial and political flexibility and reinforcing Petronas's chief purpose, Malaysian self-reliance.</p>
<p>

Petronas supervised its foreign partners' oil activities, taking no direct role in production until 1978, when the government saw to the creation of a subsidiary for oil exploration and production, Petronas Carigali. It began its work in an oil field off the Peninsula. Petronas retained its supervisory powers over all oil and gas ventures , particularly on issues of health and safety and environmental control.</p>

Developing Natural Gas: Late 1970s to the Mid-1980s</st>

<p>

The government was determined to develop Malaysia's natural gas as well as its oil. In 1974, it saw to the ordering of five tankers for liquefied natural gas (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/832128.xml">
LNG</link>) by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/7914138.xml">
Malaysian International Shipping Company</link> (MISC), of which it owned 61%. These were to take LNG exports out of Malaysia, save the cost of hiring foreign tankers, and expand the country's fleet under its own control—in contrast to cargo shipping, which was controlled by international conferences. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../417/59417.xml">
Shell</link></company>
 BV, the Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary that was building the LNG plant off Sarawak with Japanese and Asian Development Bank aid, accepted production sharing with Petronas but baulked at sharing equity, transport management, or refining. Negotiations went on, pushing commencement further and further back, until 1977, when Petronas and the government, faced with the costs of maintaining the tankers between delivery and first use, surrendered management rights—leading to a repeal of part of the Petroleum Development Act—and settled for Petronas's taking 60% of equity in the new company <plant wordnetid="103956922" confidence="0.8">

. The Sarawak state government took 5%, and the other 35% was divided equally between Shell BV and the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/455015.xml">
Mitsubishi Corporation</link></company>
. Production of LNG in Sarawak at last began in 1983.</p>
<p>

After negotiations lasting from 1977 to 1982, Petronas had concluded contracts with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/880626.xml">
Tokyo Electric Power</link> and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/11463921.xml">
Tokyo Gas</link></company>
 for the sale and delivery of LNG through to the year 2003. Malaysia LNG was to send almost the entire output of its Bintulu gas fields to Japan, under these contracts and another one, signed in 1990, to supply Saibu Gas of Fukuoka, in southwestern Japan, for 20 years from 1993.</p>

When in 1982 Petronas Carigali formed an exploration and production company with Société National Elf Aquitaine of France, it allowed Elf better terms for recovering costs than it had offered in earlier ventures. This development came against the background of the government's imposition of a depletion policy on Petronas, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 in an attempt to postpone the exhaustion of oil reserves. These were then estimated to be about 2.84&nbsp;billion barrels (452,000,000&nbsp;m3), and it was officially predicted that by the late 1980s Malaysia would be a net oil importer once again. By 1980, oil and gas already represented 24% of Malaysian exports, and the government decided to impose a tax on these exports at a 25% rate. The new policy and the new tax combined to cause Malaysia's output and exports of crude oil to fall in 1981 for the first time since Petronas was established. Output rose again, beyond its 1980 level, in the following year, but exports took until 1984 to surpass their 1980 level.</p>
<p>

However, the depletion policy was being undermined by external circumstances. Through the early 1980s, a worldwide oil glut, which OPEC proved unable to control, forced the Malaysian government to increase production to offset deterioration in its balance of increased payments to a deficit of $1 billion. It became clear that this could only be sustained by relaxing the conditions for joint ventures between Petronas and the major oil companies. In 1982, the Petronas–government share, which had risen to 80%, was cut to 70%, and taxes on company income were also cut.</p>
<p>

Petronas went into refining and distribution in 1983. It initiated the construction of refineries at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../156/51156.xml">

 in order to reduce its dependence on Royal Dutch/Shell's two refineries at <city wordnetid="108524735" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/1732134.xml">

 and Esso's refinery in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/28258.xml">
Sarawak</link>. These two majors, and other foreign companies, already covered much of the domestic retail market, but the new subsidiary Petronas Dagangan was given the initial advantage of preference in the location of its stations. By 1990, 252 service stations carried the Petronas brand, all but 20 on a franchise basis, and another 50 were planned. Some were set up on grounds of social benefit rather than of strict commercial calculation.</p>
<p>

As production from Royal Dutch/Shell and Esso's existing fields moved nearer depletion, the companies sought new fields and new contracts. In 1985, the government and Petronas revised the standard production-sharing contract, increasing the rate of recovery of capital costs from 30% to 50% of gross production in the case of oil and from 35% to 60% in the case of natural gas, abolishing signature, discovery, and production bonus payments and increasing the foreign partners' share of the profits. At first the drastic fall in oil prices during 1986, which cut Malaysia's income from exported oil by more than a third even though the volume of exports rose by 16%, discouraged interest in the new arrangements, but by 1989 Petronas had signed 22 new contracts with 31 companies from 11 countries. However, the contract period was still restricted to five years—compared, for example, with the 35-year contracts available in neighboring <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/27318.xml">
Singapore</link></country>
—and there was still a 25% levy on exported crude oil, a measure that was intended to promote the domestic refining industry. These conditions, cited as disincentives to foreign investment, were eventually relaxed over the next several years.</p>
<p>

The government and Petronas aimed to encourage the replacement of fast-depleting oil within Malaysia itself and simultaneously to foster heavy industries which could help reduce the country's overwhelming dependence on exporting its natural resources. In 1980, petroleum products accounted for 88% of the country's commercial consumption of energy, the rest being provided from hydroelectric plants in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/28258.xml">
Sarawak</link>, too far away from the main population centers to become a major alternative. Five years later, gas accounted for 17%, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/381399.xml">
hydroelectricity</link> for 19%, coal for 2%, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link> products for 62% of such consumption, and about half of each year's gas output was being consumed in Malaysia.</p>
<p>

The Petronas venture responsible for this shift in fuel use, and—along with Malaysia <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/832128.xml">
LNG</link>—for Malaysia's becoming the third largest producer of LNG in the world, was the Peninsular Gas Utilization Project (Projek Pennggunaan Gas Semenanjung), the aim of which was to supply gas to every part of the Peninsula. Its first stage was completed in 1985, following the success of smaller gasification projects in the states of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/28258.xml">
Sarawak</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/28678.xml">
Sabah</link>, and involved the extraction of gas from three fields in the Natuna Sea, between the Peninsula and the island of <land wordnetid="109334396" confidence="0.8">

; its processing in a plant at Kertih on the Peninsula's east coast; and its distribution to the state of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/376431.xml">
Terengganu</link> by pipeline and abroad via an export terminal.</p>
<p>

Petronas's least happy venture was its ownership of the <slope wordnetid="109437454" confidence="0.8">
<geological_formation wordnetid="109287968" confidence="0.8">
<bank wordnetid="109213565" confidence="0.8">

</slope>
, the second-largest, but least-profitable, of the commercial banks incorporated in Malaysia. Petronas spent more than M$3.5 billion over five years trying to rescue the bank from the impact of the bad loans it had made, starting with its support of the Carrian property group of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../404/13404.xml">

, which collapsed in 1985, taking the bank's share capital down with it. In 1991, Petronas sold the bank back to another state company, Minister of Finance Inc., and announced its intention to concentrate on oil, gas, and associated activities in future.</p>
<p>

Just as Petronas was disposing of this liability, the crisis caused by the Iraqi regime's invasion of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/7515890.xml">

 culminated in military action against <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../928/7515928.xml">

 on behalf of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../769/31769.xml">
United Nations</link>. Petronas had already raised Malaysia's oil production rate from 605,000 to 650,000&nbsp;barrels per day (103,000&nbsp;m³/d) in late 1990 as the crisis unfolded. This move only reinforced the company's awareness of the need to vary its policies, since, with known reserves of 2.94&nbsp;billion barrels (467,000,000&nbsp;m3), and assuming no new major finds of oil, Malaysia risked seeing output decline to 350,000&nbsp;barrels per day (56,000&nbsp;m³/d) in 2000 and running down to depletion within another five years. This was exacerbated by the possibility that <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">

 in general would enjoy rapid economic growth in the 1990s, so that demand for oil there would rise twice as fast as demand in the relatively more sluggish, more mature economies of North America and Europe. The Malaysian government, and its state oil and gas company, was forced to decide what mixture of policies to adopt in response.</p>

Battling Oil Depletion: Late 1980s</st>

<p>

Fortunately for <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/3607937.xml">
Malaysia</link></country>
, exploration was by no means at an end and could yet produce more reserves. The Seligi field, which came onstream at the end of 1988 and was developed by Esso Production Malaysia, was one of the richest oilfields so far found in Malaysian waters, and further concessions to the majors would encourage exploration of the deeper waters around Malaysia, where unknown reserves could be discovered. Meanwhile, computerized seismography made it both feasible and commercially justifiable to re-explore fields which had been abandoned, or were assumed to be unproductive, over the past century. In 1990, Petronas invited foreign companies to re-explore parts of the sea off Sabah and Sarawak on the basis of new surveys using up-to-date techniques.</p>
<p>

Another way to postpone depletion was to develop sources of oil, and of its substitute, natural gas, outside Malaysia. Late in 1989, the governments of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/202354.xml">
Vietnam</link></country>
 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/19457.xml">
Myanmar</link> (Burma) invited Petronas Carigali to take part in joint ventures to explore for oil in their coastal waters. In 1990, a new unit, Petronas Carigali Overseas Sdn Bhd, was created to take up a 15% interest in a field in Myanmarese waters being explored by Idemitsu Myanmar Oil Exploration Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the Japanese firm Idemitsu Oil Development Co. Ltd., in a production sharing arrangement with <link>
Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise</link>. Thus began Petronas's first oil exploration outside Malaysia. In May 1990, the governments of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/3607937.xml">

 settled a long-running dispute over their respective rights to an area of 7,300 square kilometers in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../107/198107.xml">
Gulf of Thailand</link> by setting up a joint administrative authority for the area and encouraging a joint oil exploration project by Petronas, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, and the U.S. company <link>
Triton Oil</link>. In a separate deal, in October 1990, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand arranged with Petronas to study the feasibility of transferring natural gas from this jointly administered area, through Malaysia to Thailand, by way of an extension of the pipelines laid for the third stage of the Peninsular Gas Utilization Project.</p>
<p>

That project was on course to becoming a major element in the postponement of oil depletion. Contracts for line pipes for the second stage of the project were signed in 1989 with two consortia of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/433501.xml">

<p>

Another new venture in 1990 was in ship-owning, since Petronas's existing arrangements with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/6997002.xml">
MISC</link> and with Nigeria's state oil company would be inadequate to transport the additional exports of LNG due to start in 1994, under the contract with Saibu Gas.

 of the United States did not negate the policy, for the subsidiary company Petronas Penapisan (Melaka) had a decisive 45% of equity while sharing the enormous costs of and gaining advanced technology for the project. More to the point, a side effect of the refinery's completion was that Petronas was able to refine all of the crude oil it produced, instead of being partially dependent on refining facilities in Singapore.</p>
<p>

Petronas, with its policies of promoting self-reliance, helping to develop associated industries, and varying the sources and uses of oil and gas, played an important role in the Malaysian economy as a whole. Under governments which—by current, if not historical, Western standards—were strongly interventionist, the contribution of oil taxes to the federal government's revenue hovered at around 12% to 16% until 1980, when it showed a marked increase to 23%, followed by another leap to 32% in 1981. From then until 1988 the proportion fluctuated between 29% and 36%. Petronas was not just another big oil company: it controlled a crucial sector of the economy and remained, for better or worse, an indispensable instrument of the state. </p>

Petronas awards education sponsorships in the form of convertible loans to Malaysian and international students to further their studies at local or foreign universities. The Petronas unit that is responsible for handling education matters is called the Education Sponsorship Unit (ESU). These sponsorships are awarded based on academic results, co-curricular activities, family background as well as an assessment of student personality (which is conducted throughout a program called EduCamp, which all prospective Petronas students are required to undergo). Students who are absorbed by Petronas at the end of their tertiary studies have their convertible loans converted into full scholarships. These students are under contract agreement to work for the company for two years for every one year they are sponsored.</p>
