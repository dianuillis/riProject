 state.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  Spiedie consists of cubes of chicken and pork, but it may also be made from lamb, veal, venison or beef. The meat cubes are marinated overnight or longer (sometimes for as long as two weeks under a controlled environment) in a special spiedie marinade, then grilled carefully on spits (if steel skewers are used, they are called "spiedie irons") over a charcoal pit.  The freshly prepared cubes are served on soft Italian bread or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/26918.xml">
submarine</link> roll, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../658/244658.xml">
skewer</link> and all, then drizzled with fresh marinade. The roll is used as an oven glove to grip the meat while the skewer is removed. Spiedie meat cubes can also be eaten straight off the skewer or can be served in salads, stir fries, and a number of other dishes. The marinade recipe varies, usually involving olive oil, vinegar, and a variety of Italian spices and fresh mint.  </p>

History</st>
<p>

The original idea for spiedie was brought by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/125320.xml">
Italian</link> immigrants to Upstate New York in the early 1920s.  The specific origin of the spiedie is disputed.  Two men &ndash; Agostino "Augie" Iacovelli and Peter Sharak &ndash; are credited with the creation of the spiedie.  </p>
<p>

Iacovelli, from <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/126134.xml">
Endicott, New York</link></village>
, began serving spiedie sandwiches in 1939 when he opened Augie's, his first restaurant.  He emigrated from <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 (Civitella Casanova) at the age of 25 in 1923.  His son Guido continued in the spiedie business into the 1990s, owning as many as 26 restaurants at the peak of his career.</p>
<p>

Sharak is also supposed to have invented spiedies. Apparently, patrons of Sharkey’s Bar and Grill were served lamb straight from the grill on its metal skewer with slices of bread.  Sharkey's promotes itself as the birthplace of the sandwich in television commercials across the greater Binghamton area.</p>
<p>

Though the issue is disputed, Sharkey’s began serving spiedies in 1947, which makes Iacovelli more likely to have invented the dish first.</p>
<p>

The term "spiedie" comes from the Italian "spiedo," meaning "spit."  Traditionally the early Broome County spiedie was made only from spring lamb, but currently most commercial restaurants prepare spiedie using chicken or pork.  The "chicken category" was added to the Spiedie Fest cook-off in 1987, and quickly became the most popular meat choice.  The regional dish in Abruzzo, Italy most closely resembling spiedie uses goat meat. Another regional dish from <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/27619.xml">
Sicily</link></region>
, "zúzzu," consists of a gelatinous sausage made from the cartilage of pork and beef meat that is usually served cut into cubes. </p>
<p>

Iacovelli's marinade, which he called "Zuzu," originally was made simply from wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, garlic and mint.  Italian spices, olive oil and minced onion were added later as regional tastes and the choice of meat began to vary.  </p>
<p>

One of the restaurants most famous for spiedies today, <link>
Lupo's Char-Pit</link>, was established in 1967 by John, Sam, and Bart Lupo in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/126135.xml">
Endwell, New York</link></village>
.</p>
<p>

In 1975, Rob Salamida began bottling spiedie sauce for sale.  His company now produces and sells <link>
Salamida's State Fair Spiedie Sauce</link> from a 15,000-square-foot (1,400&nbsp;m2) facility in Johnson City, New York and states that it has sold over 2 million bottles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

There are many restaurants in the Southern Tier that specialize in spiedies: Brooks' House of Bar-B-Que, Lupo's Char Pit, Sharkey's Restaurant, Spiedie and Rib Pit, Lupo's S &amp; S Grill, and Poncho's Pit are some of the more well known.

 and The Spiedie Grill are listed. In Phoenixville, PA, 45 minutes west of Philadelphia, Spiedie Bistro opened in March 2008. Specializing in spiedies, Spiedie Bistro has taken a healthier route offering organic tofu, organic portabellos and organic bison all marinated using their own spiedie marinate. Nationally, Spiedini or "Mixed Grill" prepared the spiedie way is available at the <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

. It is worthy of note though that the Spiedini or "Mixed Grill" served at Olive Garden Italian Restaurant, though cooked in a similar method (on a skewer) would not be considered a "spiedie" as described by this article.</p>
