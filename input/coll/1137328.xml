Investment Company Act of 1940</link>. Rule 2a-7 of the act restricts investments in money market funds by quality, maturity and diversity. Under this act, a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt which matures in under 13 months. The portfolio must maintain a <link>

 Breaking the buck </st>

<p>

Money market funds seek a stable $1.00 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../368/1259368.xml">
net asset value</link> (NAV): they aim never to lose money. If a fund's NAV drops below $1.00, one says that the fund "broke the buck".</p>
<p>

This has rarely happened: as of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/27650.xml">
September 16</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/35825.xml">
2008</link>, two money funds have broken the buck (in the 37 year history of money funds), and from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/34748.xml">
1971</link> to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../145/28145.xml">
September 15</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/35825.xml">
2008</link>, there was only one failure.</p>
<p>

The Community Bankers US Government Fund broke the buck in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/18948337.xml">
1994</link>, paying investors 96 cents per share. This was the first failure in the then 23 year history of money funds, and there were no further failures for 14 years. The fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities. As interest rates increased, these floating rate securities lost value. This fund was an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Institutional+money+fund%22])">
institutional money fund</link>, not a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Retail+money+fund%22])">
retail money fund</link>, thus individuals were not directly affected.</p>
<p>

No further failures occurred until September 2008, a month that saw tumultuous events for money funds.</p>

On Monday, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../145/28145.xml">
September 15</link>, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

On Tuesday, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/27650.xml">
September 16</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/19691490.xml">

<p>

On the same day, BNY <link>
Institutional Cash Reserves</link>, which was not a money fund, but a securities lending fund run by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/12097619.xml">

<p>

The resulting investor anxiety almost caused a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../498/704498.xml">
run on the bank</link> for money funds, as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions: through Wednesday, institutional funds saw net outflows of $173 billion, to $2.17 trillion, a withdrawal of over 7%.
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Retail funds saw net inflows of $4 billion, for a net outflow from all funds of $169 billion, to $3.4 trillion<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> (5%). The lack of retail outflows is attributed to the lag required for individuals to open a new account to transfer their funds out, and retail funds expected significant withdrawals the following week.</p>
<p>

On Thursday, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/28146.xml">
September 18</link>, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

’ <link>
Putnam Prime Money Market Fund</link>, a $12.3 institutional fund, announced that it was liquidating, due to redemptions.</p>
<p>

In response, on Friday, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/28147.xml">
September 19</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../667/53667.xml">
United States Treasury</link> announced an optional program to "insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund — both retail and institutional — that pays a fee to participate in the program."

The guarantee is backed by assets of the Treasury Department's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../742/1699742.xml">
Exchange Stabilization Fund</link> up to a maximum of $50 billion.</p>
<p>

The program immediately stabilized the system and stanched the outflows,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> and drew criticism from banking organizations, including the <group wordnetid="100031264" confidence="0.8">

 Analysis </st>
<p>

The crisis almost developed into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../498/704498.xml">
run</link> on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../225/16458225.xml">
shadow banking system</link>: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../624/1156624.xml">
commercial paper</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> preventing companies from <link>

default</link> on their obligations, and may have to file for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/4695.xml">
bankruptcy</link>. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/48847.xml">
deflation</link> spiral, and serious damage to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/9223.xml">

</condition>
.</p>
<p>

The drop in demand resulted in a "buyers strike", as money funds could not (because of redemptions) or would not (because of fear of redemptions) buy commercial paper, driving yields up dramatically: from around 2% the previous week to 8%,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> and funds put their money in Treasuries, driving their yields close to 0%.</p>
<p>

This is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities, and thus a money fund is a "virtual bank": the assets of money funds, while short term, nonetheless typically have maturities of several months, while investors can request redemption at any time, without waiting for obligations to come due. Thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions, the assets may be liquidated in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../853/14706853.xml">
fire sale</link>, depressing their sale price.</p>
<p>

An earlier crisis occurred in 2007–2008, where the demand for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/16362696.xml">
Asset Backed Commercial Paper</link> dropped, causing the collapse of some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../946/9105946.xml">

Banks in the United States offer savings and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/3765190.xml">

 Enhanced cash funds </st>
<p>

<b>Enhanced cash funds</b> are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/2704982.xml">
bond fund</link>s similar to money market funds, in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation, but which:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>
<list>

 have less liquidity;</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 do not aim as strongly for stable NAV.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds, but others in riskier, higher yielding, less liquid assets such as:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>

In general, the NAV will stay close to $1, but is expected to fluctuate above and below, and will break the buck more often.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> Different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> and thus take few risks, while others see these as more bond-like, and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal. These are typically available only to institutional investors, not retail investors.</p>
<p>

The purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets, but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds – to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash. That is, within one's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../889/2168889.xml">
asset allocation</link>, one has a continuum between cash and long-term investments:

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 long-term bonds and other non-cash long-term investments – least liquid and most risky, but highest yielding.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

There are also funds which are billed as "money market funds", but are not 2a-7 funds (do not meet the requirements of the rule).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> In addition to 2a-7 eligible securities, these funds invest in <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

 Types of money funds </st>

<ss1>
<st>
 Institutional money fund </st>
<p>

Institutional money funds are high minimum investment, low expense share classes which are marketed to corporations, governments, or fiduciaries. They are often set up so that money is swept to them overnight from a company's main operating accounts. Large national chains often have many accounts with banks all across the country, but electronically pull a majority of funds on deposit with them to a concentrated money market fund.</p>
<p>

The largest institutional money fund is the JPMorgan Prime Money Market Fund, with over US$100 billion in assets. Among the largest companies offering institutional money funds are BlackRock, Federated, Columbia (Bank of America), Dreyfus, AIM and Evergreen (Wachovia).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Retail money funds </st>
<p>

Retail money funds are offered primarily to individuals with moderate-sized accounts. Their primary use is as temporary holding funds at stock brokerage firms. Retail money market funds hold roughly 40% of all money market fund assets. </p>
<p>

Retail money funds invest in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../999/236999.xml">

commercial paper</link>, come in a few different breeds: <link>
government-only funds</link>, <link>
non-government funds</link> and <link>
tax-free funds</link>. Yields are typically somewhat higher than in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../241/1137241.xml">
savings accounts</link>. Investors will obtain a slightly higher yield in the non-government variety, whose principal holdings are high-quality commercial paper and other instruments. Instruments of the United States Government are usually exempt from state income taxes, and their returns are lower as a result.</p>
