<b>Piadina</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../620/3735620.xml">
Italian</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/2493459.xml">
flatbread</link> that is chewy and soft enough to bend, not crisp like a cracker.  It consists of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/334546.xml">
dough</link> similar to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/24768.xml">
pizza</link> dough that is rolled flat and thin until all the air is removed.  Unlike pizza dough which is leavened with yeast and contains no fat, piadina dough is leavened with baking powder or soda and contains a fat such as olive oil, lard or shortening, giving it a flaky mouthfeel similar to savory pie dough.  It is then cooked on a griddle or in a large flat pan until it it shows dark spots on both sides.   Piadini can be served with a variety of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/11749910.xml">

vegetable</link>s on top of it, or with things such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../065/75065.xml">
hummus</link>. It is usually folded in half to eat, similar to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/29985.xml">
