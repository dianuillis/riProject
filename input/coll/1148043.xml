Māori cuisine</st>
<p>

When <link>
Māori</link> (New Zealand's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../281/45281.xml">
indigenous</link> people) first arrived in New Zealand from tropical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../066/19631066.xml">
Polynesia</link>, they brought with them a number of food plants, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../078/57078.xml">
taro</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/51628.xml">
kumara</link> (sweet potato), and also dogs and rats, which could also be food sources. The plants did not grow as well in New Zealand's temperate climate as they did in the tropics, and would not grow at all in the colder <island wordnetid="109316454" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../049/62049.xml">
South Island</link></island>
. Bananas and coconuts - which they also brought with them - would not grow even in the <island wordnetid="109316454" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../046/62046.xml">
North Island</link></island>
. Foods such as fernroot became a more important part of the diet than in other Pacific Islands, and some native New Zealand plants were also eaten, along with insects such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/1479756.xml">
huhu grub</link>. Problems with horticulture were made up for by an abundance of bird and marine life. Larger species, such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/62366.xml">
moa</link>, were eventually hunted to extinction. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../393/1505393.xml">
Rahui</link>(resource restrictions) could be applied to ensure the survival of species. These included forbidding the hunting of certain species in particular places or at certain times of year, so that the species could regenerate. </p>
<p>

Like other Polynesian peoples, Māori cooked their food in earth ovens, known in New Zealand as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/493816.xml">
hangi</link>, although the word <it>umu</it> was also used - as in other Pacific languages. Other cooking methods included roasting and, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/1839215.xml">
geothermal</link> areas, boiling or steaming using natural hot springs and pools. Occasionally food would be boiled in non-geothermal areas by putting hot stones into a bowl with water and the food; and some food was also cooked over the open fire. Some foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, or layers of fat - particularly muttonbirds. Māori were one of the few peoples to have no form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/18948043.xml">
alcoholic beverage</link>.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Food and religion</st>
<p>

In traditional <link>
Māori religion</link>, food was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../104/749104.xml">
noa</link>, or non-sacred. This meant it could not come into contact with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/12402432.xml">
tapu</link> (sacred land, places or objects). If it did, the tapu would be removed and the power of the place or object, and often the people associated with it, would be destroyed. High chiefs, and people engaged in tapu work such as tattooing, were tapu and were restricted in how they could deal with food; the most tapu needing to be fed by others. One story tells of a war party which had to be postponed as no non-tapu people were available to load the food supplies into the party's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../004/1480004.xml">
waka</link>.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
Pākehā influences</st>
<p>

When Europeans (<link>
Pākehā</link>) first arrived in New Zealand from the late eighteenth century, they brought their own foods with them. Some of these, especially <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../929/19719929.xml">
pork</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/23501.xml">
potatoes</link>, were quickly adopted by Māori and helped end the threat of food shortages that had long plagued many Maori tribes. Potatoes were particularly popular as they were grown in the same way as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/51628.xml">
kumara</link> but produced a much higher yield with less effort. Other European foods such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../858/36858.xml">
wheat</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/18581150.xml">
pumpkin</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../275/229275.xml">
mutton</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/27712.xml">
sugar</link> and many types of fruit also became a common part of the Māori diet. <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

 sailors brought new varieties of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/51628.xml">
sweet potato</link> to New Zealand, and these high-yield varieties quickly superseded the original varieties of kumara. </p>
<p>

Alcohol, initially rejected as 'wai piro' (stinking water), also became part of Māori life.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Most Māori tribes grew surpluses of food for trade with other tribes and with European visitors and settlers. Some tribes grew wealthy from this trade, although the Māori food industry declined in the mid nineteenth century due to land loss and competition from Pākehā farmers. Many traditional food sources, such as the <link>
kererū</link> (wood pigeon) and other birds, as well as some types of fish and plants, became scarcer as forests were destroyed and species were over-hunted by Pākehā.</p>

Māori cuisine today</st>
<p>

Present day Māori cuisine is a mixture of Māori tradition, old fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. Most large Māori gatherings feature a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/493816.xml">
hangi</link>, which is likely to contain foods brought to New Zealand by Māori and by Pākehā. A wide selection of cakes and other sweet foods of the kind beloved by nineteenth century English are available - which many Māori have become very fond of. Coconut and bananas, unlike their Pacific Island neighbours, are not part of the traditional diet of Maori but have been reintroduced in the more contemporary Pacific Rim influenced Maori cooking courtesy of modern transportation.</p>
<p>

In less formal occasions, distinctively Māori dishes include the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/2132644.xml">
boil-up</link> - of pork, potatoes, kumara, and dumplings, which is also similar to traditional British cooking methods, and pork and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/1581508.xml">
puha</link> - sow thistle, which combines an introduced meat with an indigenous vegetable. In recent decades there has been much concern that Māori have picked up the worst of European eating habits and as a result are disproportionately likely to suffer from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">
obesity</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/69276.xml">
heart disease</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/44677.xml">
diabetes</link>.</p>

The majority of <link>
Pākehā</link> - also known as New Zealand Europeans; are of British descent, and so it is not surprising Pākehā cuisine owes much to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/7896915.xml">
British cuisine</link>.</p>

Settler food</st>
<p>

Nineteenth century British settlers in New Zealand tried as much as possible to reproduce the foods of their homeland. In the early stages of colonisation this was difficult as many ingredients were unavailable. Pākehā settlers ate native birds and fish, and used local ingredients in substitution for those which were unavailable, for example brewing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../969/29969.xml">
tea</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/3363.xml">
beer</link> using unconventional plants. Most of these innovations were abandoned as the Pākehā population increased and conventional ingredients began to be mass-imported or produced in New Zealand. One innovation which was commonly served on New Zealand tables until the mid 1980s was the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/382589.xml">
Colonial Goose</link>, a stuffed leg of lamb which substituted for the goose <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. A major difference between British and Pākehā food was that meat was much more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. Whereas in nineteenth century <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/152256.xml">
Britain</link>, labourers ate meat in very small quantities, in New Zealand they could have it for every meal. Since meat was a high status food in Britain, British settlers in New Zealand ate vast quantities of it.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> </p>
<p>

It is noted <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../994/26994.xml">

 provided the largest number of British ancestors of today's Pakeha.  The Scottish legacy on food could be seen through a traditional preference of sweet foods, and a wealth of baking dishes to celebrate important occasions, reflected through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../572/57572.xml">
cakes</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../562/279562.xml">
scones</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/312506.xml">
muffins</link> and other mainly sweet baking dishes. The country's most iconic recipe book, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/4515617.xml">
Edmonds Cookbook</link>, originally began as publicity material for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../284/193284.xml">
baking powder</link> company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes.</p>

Increasing Internationalisation</st>
<p>

For most of the twentieth century, Pākehā cuisine remained highly derivative of British food.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> This included all the best and worst qualities of British food culture, including the idea that the only real meal consisted of meat and three vegetables, the idea that cooking well was not an important skill, and general conservatism with overseas food rejected as 'foreign muck'. From about the 1960s, the advent of affordable air travel allowed New Zealanders to travel overseas more easily. Most Pākehā went to Europe on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/2773183.xml">
OE</link>, where they discovered French and Italian cooking, and also the Indian and Chinese restaurants of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/1048927.xml">
Britain</link> as well as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/7896915.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Modern+British+cuisine%22])">
New British cuisine</link>. When the sojourners returned home they helped create a demand for better quality food and more variety.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> They also tried to discover what New Zealand cuisine was, experimenting with hangi and gaining a greater appreciation of New Zealand produce.

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/9578.xml">
European Economic Community</link></organization>
 (EEC) in 1973 has sounded the death knell of New Zealand's identity as an agricultural producer for the British Isles, and the formal cultural ties, including cuisine, with the United Kingdom started to become diluted.  During this period, certain non-British or Irish European dishes, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../370/2247370.xml">
beef bourguignon</link>, had shed the 'ethnic' connotation and entered the mainstream New Zealand cooking. </p>

 that abolished farm subsidies, forcing many farmers to find ingenuous means of survival.  Many chose to produce specialty cheeses such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../874/154874.xml">

 region, that subsequently developed into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/1644312.xml">

<p>

Rogernomics also abolished much of import tariffs and instituted a more relaxed agricultural product import quarantine regime. This allows hereunto prohibited or prohibitively expensive specialty foods, such as genuine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/2199539.xml">

mango</link> from Thailand, to be available in New Zealand at reasonable costs.  These two developments from Rogernomics have given birth to a proliferation of specialist food products available in New Zealand.</p>
<p>

On top of changes in available ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly 'foreign muck' cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status.  The realisation that New Zealand is a distinctly different nation from the British Isles had become mainstream and this also made reception towards foreign styles of cooking more acceptable among the general public<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>. The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to pursue copious consumption as a lifestyle, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, interpreted to be conformity to lower middle class lifestyle tastes, waned in influence.  In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist <link>
David Veart</link>, this period of seachange in New Zealand's culinary culture was akin to "being let out after a long school detention".</p>

Other cuisines in New Zealand</st>
<p>

New Zealanders come from many ethnic backgrounds, and most immigrants to New Zealand have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Similar to early Pākehā settlers, this often proved difficult. Larger ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, were able to import some ingredients, but often dishes had to be modified to use local ingredients. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines. However for most of its history there were few ethnic restaurants in New Zealand other than inauthentic Chinese, Indian and Italian eateries. </p>
<p>

The Immigration Act 1987 completely abolished nationality preference for immigration, and immigration from <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../827/26827.xml">

</region>
 has skyrocketed after the law was enacted. Many of these immigrants have brought their different cuisines to New Zealand, and often opened ethnic restaurants and takeaway eateries, giving New Zealanders a chance to try more authentic editions of Japanese, Thai, Malay, regional Chinese, Indian, and other Asian cuisines.  Over time these ethnic cuisines have been gradually accepted by Pakeha and Maori New Zealanders.  Consequently, most New Zealand cities have a wide variety of ethnic restaurants, and foods such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../616/390616.xml">
kebabs</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/6745.xml">
couscous</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/28271.xml">
sushi</link> are served virtually everywhere. Many ethnic origin dishes have been willingly adopted by New Zealanders as their own, including sushi, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/1814485.xml">
antipasto</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../980/608980.xml">
butter chicken</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/395707.xml">
pad thai</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/23871.xml">
pasta</link> such that they appear in home cooking as well as in generic New Zealand restaurants.  </p>
<p>

Ingredients for many ethnic dishes have become much easier to find in major cities, mostly through speciality or ethnic food stores started by many of the post-1987 migrants to New Zealand, but in some cases also through mainstream New Zealand supermarket chains.  Similar to Australia, in time the increasing availability of ingredients gave birth to a more authentic style of ethnic cooking, and some ethnic food ingredients have been adopted for local cooking: ingredients such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
extra virgin olive oil</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/9940234.xml">
sun dried tomato</link>es, and to a lesser extent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/46482.xml">
fish sauce</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/416207.xml">
rice paper</link> were already seen as ordinary ingredients by the year 2000, whereas even by the late 1980s many people would still have regarded them as highly exotic.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

Contemporary New Zealand Culinary Scene</st>

As a result of various developments, the food scene of New Zealand in the early 21st century is in a state of flux: cosmopolitan Pacific Rim fares reign is now the norm in much of metropolitan eating out scenes <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>, and traditional hearty settlers food, now dubbed <it>Kwisine Kiwiana</it>, but reinterpreted through Pacific Rim cooking knowledge, is a popular cooking style for eating out scenes even in the most remote rural regions.  Most of the home cooking prepared at households in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 is now a mix of traditional Kiwiana dishes heavily modified by Mediterranean and Asian techniques and ingredients, and adapted versions of Mediterranean, Chinese, and Indian dishes.  In the more culturally traditional parts of the country, such as rural <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/61979.xml">
Canterbury</link> and the <link>

An active nostalgia movement supports the traditional Kiwiana cuisine, as spreadheaded by the popularity of television series <link>
Kiwi Kitchen</link> presented by Richard Till, which is believed to be a public response to a common perception that the traditional Kiwiana dishes are disappearing from the New Zealand tables <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>. Home baking is particularly believed to be the last bastion of New Zealand cuisine still unaffected by international trends.   </p>
<p>

Concurrently, food habits are changing in Australia to lighter fares influenced by the Mediterranean, and subsequently Southeast Asian, styles of cooking. The proximity, common history, and strong modern political, economic, cultural, and family ties between the two countries means many New Zealand chefs have always been well informed of the trends in the Australian dining scene.  Many endeavor to learn from their trans-Tasman counterparts, and in time the changing Australian culinary scene has trickle-down effects on the New Zealand cuisine as well <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>.  </p>
<p>

In general, there are minimal differences between the food preference of New Zealand and Australia, except New Zealand's palates are generally sweeter than Australia due to a residual Scottish influence.  The food trends in New Zealand tend to trail its trans-Tasman counterparts by a few years to a decade, such as the Mediterranean cookery did not become mainstream in New Zealand until the dawn of 1990s, while its influence was already felt in Australia by the 1980s; and while Australia has by the early 21st century developed a well established niche specialist produce distributing channel, similar systems are still in its infancy on the other side of the Tasman.  However, in recent times <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>  </p>
<p>

One major recent development in the food scene is the emergence of a genuine cafe culture and disappearance of the traditional institution of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/1389262.xml">
tearooms</link> at large.  Before the 1990s, tearooms proliferated throughout the country offering <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/279555.xml">
cream tea</link> with scones, cream, and cucumber sandwiches, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/312506.xml">
muffins</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/1072540.xml">
custard squares</link>, with filtered coffee or tea as drinks.  New Zealanders have copied the Australian habits of adopting Mediterranean practice of drinking <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/47660.xml">
espresso</link> derived coffees <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref>.  In time, cafes became wildly popular and many tearoom owners converted their businesses to cafes and learned to use espresso machines in a rush.  Cream tea has gone out of fashion in the contemporary New Zealand dining scene, and scones are baked at homes rather than served in eateries.  </p>
<p>

Vegetarianism had been regarded as an alternative lifestyle for many years; but became more mainstream during the 1980s even though consistent vegetarians are still rare.  Despite exhortations by the Ministry of Health and their allies for people to eat less meat, and more cereals, fruits, and vegetables, a highly meat-based diet remains a part of New Zealand culture, albeit with decrease of red meat consumption and intake of fish and chicken has been on the rise.</p>

 Patterns of eating </st>

<p>

Most New Zealanders eat their main meal (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/19337173.xml">
Tea (meal)</link>| Tea) - sometimes known as dinner - in the evening. Most families living in one household try to eat dinner together several times a week. The formality and structure of these meals varies from family to family. Some families sit at a dining table, say <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/3512505.xml">
grace</link>, ensure children use cutlery correctly and generally obey strict <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/3780915.xml">
table manners</link>; others will be more informal but still sit around a table; and others will sit on couches and armchairs with their plates on their laps, watching television. Typically the food is cooked by the mother of the family, with or without assistance from other family members, but in some cases other family members will cook. As social times change, fathers are doing more of the family cooking.  Although a few New Zealanders cook most things 'from scratch', most New Zealand home cooks are dependent to some extent on pre-made ingredients (in particular, packaged soup and sauce mixes).  Cakes are very rarely made from packet mix - this has never really taken on in New Zealand. Most families eat takeaways (take-out) such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/46173.xml">
fish and chips</link>, Chinese takeaways, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/24768.xml">
pizza</link> about once a week. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/265567.xml">
flats</link> (households shared by a group of unrelated young people), flatmates will generally either take turns cooking or each cook and eat individually.</p>
<p>

In the summer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/37135.xml">
barbecue</link>s are common, generally as a social event. Guests will usually be invited to bring beer (and/or wine) and on occasion meat, which the host will cook.  Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. It is traditional for the men to cook the meat, and for the women to do everything else, although these patterns are changing.  Similar Maori gatherings will often feature a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/493816.xml">
hangi</link> (pronounced hung-ee), a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top. The whole oven is sprinkled with water and sealed with more vegetation. The hole is then filled with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whanau) help out for such a feast. The occasion is relaxed, friendly and fun, with people often eating the meal under a marquee.</p>
<p>

Many New Zealand gatherings feature a custom known as '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../052/8528052.xml">
bring a plate</link>' in which each guest will bring a plate of food to share. This allows people to host large groups without incurring serious expense. Similar customs include guests bringing salads or meat to a barbecue. Most New Zealand parties are '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../697/1682697.xml">
BYO</link>' (bring your own alcohol), but in this case the drinks are not usually shared. This is especially the case with parties hosted by young people, who cannot usually afford alcohol for more than a few people. One exception is sometimes the 21st birthday party, which will often be funded by the host's family.</p>
<p>

New Zealand's restaurant culture has developed strongly over the past three decades, thanks partially to the liberalisation of liquor licensing laws. However a visit to a restaurant is still not a regular activity for most New Zealanders, although many regularly visit cafes for lunch. With the exception of relatively wealthy people and those who are particularly interested in food, a restaurant meal is usually something only experienced on a special occasion.</p>
<p>

There is a '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/360101.xml">
fast food</link>' culture similar to that in the United States, Australia and Britain. Many American fast food chains have a presence in New Zealand, and local variants based on quality local produce (such as <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://burgerfuel.co.nz">
Burger Fuel</weblink> and <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.hell.co.nz">
Hell Pizza</weblink> for example) have arisen. The pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to street food, though its popularity has waned. A fast food chain based on pies, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/2202678.xml">
Georgie Pie</link></institution>
</company>
, was founded in 1977 but went out of business in the mid-1990s.  Currently another fast food chain selling pies exists: Australian-based <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.jesters-pies.co.nz">
Jester's</weblink> produces pies using throughout New Zealand's North Island, predominantly Auckland. </p>
<p>

In the main centres food courts have become popular, with several in Auckland alone. Immigration has led to an increase in choice and quality, with many food halls offering cuisines including Thai, Indian, Turkish, Malaysian Japanese and Chinese, as well as distinctly New Zealand fare such as roast dinners.</p>

As an example, in 1984 there were only two producers of olive oil hailing from New Zealand.  20 years later, the figure stands at 600. Andre Taber, <it>A Buyer's Guide to New Zealand Olive Oil</it>, New Holland Publishers, 2007, pg 9</entry>

Peta Mathias</link> in 2005 claims ingredients such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/46482.xml">
fish sauce</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/416207.xml">
rice paper</link> are now a normal part of New Zealand household pantries. Peta Mathias, <it>A Cook's Tour of New Zealand</it>, Penguin Viking, July 2005, pg 16. Many New Zealanders still regard these as 'ethnic' ingredients, although as in Australia the foreign connotation is decreasing with the passage of time.  See also David Veart, <it>Ibid</it>, pg 295-314.</entry>

There are even reports that in Auckland by 2007, the traditional fund-raising <link>
sausage sizzles</link> at many schools in the more affluent suburbs have been replaced with sushi, a supposedly lower fat and healthier alternative.</entry>

An example is Judith Tabron, owner of the Soul Bar and Bistro in Auckland. Tabron invites Australian chefs such as <link>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../421/53421.xml">
Philip Johnson</link></person>
, <link>
Stephanie Alexander</link>, and <link>
Greg Malouf</link> across the Tasman to New Zealand as guest chefs at Soul from time to time specifically to teach her staff about current Australian food trends, and some of their styles of cooking have become part of the standard menu at Soul which subsequently become New Zealand eating scene via the publishing of these dishes' recipes in popular home cookbooks in New Zealand.  Judith Tabron, <it>Soul</it>, Random House New Zealand, 2005, pg 7-9</entry>
<entry id="13">
A positive Australian comment on modern urban New Zealand cooking, specifically Auckland, is from Bruce Elder of the Sydney Morning Herald, "...here was a time when discriminating eaters [from Australia] were told to take a packed lunch when visiting New Zealand. Now it is consistently good and also, at the upper end, very cheap. With an exchange rate of around $NZ1.20 equalling $AUD1 meals at the best restaurants in Auckland work out at around $AUD25 for mains and that, literally, is half what you would pay for the same in Sydney's upmarket restaurants." Bruce Elder, <it>Eating in New Zealand (Part 2)</it> http://blogs.smh.com.au/trampaboutnz/archives//007306.html.  A number of Sydney and Melbourne fine-dining restaurants have Auckland connections - such as Wildfire restaurant in Sydney is owned by the former owner of Cin Cin in Auckland.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../191/2623191.xml">
Molecular cuisine</link> has also landed in Auckland as in Sydney by 2006, but is still unheard of in much of the country.</entry>

The second edition of Australian foodie Stephanie Alexander's <it>The Cook's Companion</it> includes several recipes made with ingredients traditionally produced in New Zealand but not her own country. Judith Tabron, <it>Ibid</it>, pg 128</entry>

For example, the <it>Cuisine</it> magazine was selected as the best food magazine in the world at the 2007 Le Cordon Bleu World Food Media Awards run by Tasting Australia and sponsored by Le Cordon Bleu, beating other food magazines published in other parts of the English-speaking world http://www.cuisine.co.nz/index.cfm?pageID=54996&amp;r=1</entry>
