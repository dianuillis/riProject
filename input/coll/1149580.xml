Founded in 1889, The <b>National Association of Letter Carriers</b> (or <b>NALC</b>) is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/17626.xml">
labor union</link> of city letter carriers employed by the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Letter carrier</link>s  delivered 213 billion pieces of mail last year, six days a week, to over 146 million homes and businesses in every city, suburb and town in America.

 History </st>
<p>

In 1889, the Milwaukee Letter Carriers, knowing many of their fellow carriers would be attending the Grand Army of the Republic encampment in their city that summer, issued an official Call to meet during the reunion to form a national association and act on other matters of importance to letter carriers and their families.  </p>
<p>

Heeding the Call, 60 letter carriers from 18 states gathered in the meeting room above Schaefer's Saloon. On August 29, 1889 they unanimously adopted a resolution to form a National Association of Letter Carriers. The next day, the convention elected officers and adopted a number of resolutions. </p>
<p>

Over the years, the union has worked to reduce working hours, the weight of loads that must be lifted at any one time, the strictness of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../237/38237.xml">
uniform</link>-wearing standards, and other worklife-quality issues, as well as the obvious ones of pay and benefits.  Activists stress that the Postal Service management style is often one of the more dictatorial ones in the modern <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

, and imply that this is one of the reasons that a seemingly disproportionate number of USPS employees become infamous for "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/347098.xml">
going postal</link>", although they also point out that the vast majority of such employees were <it>not</it> members of the union. However, statistics show that NALC member carriers are one of the most respected group of workers in the United States.</p>
<p>

Prior to the <link>
Postal Reorganization Act of 1970</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../858/875858.xml">
U.S. Post Office</link> was a department of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/10263.xml">
executive branch</link> of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../149/195149.xml">
United States Government</link> and the <position wordnetid="108621598" confidence="0.8">

 was a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../537/54537.xml">
Cabinet</link> member.  This meant that the rate of postal pay was set by the <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
United States Congress</link></legislature>
 into <link>
federal law</link>.  This somewhat-unique arrangement meant that the NALC was even more overtly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/22986.xml">
political</link> than most other labor unions.  Like most other U.S. unions, it has largely supported the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/5043544.xml">
Democratic Party</link>, but has been critical of Democrats who have hurt the interests of its members (such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../661/74661.xml">

 of a postal pay raise in the mid-1960s, and has supported individual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/32070.xml">
Republicans</link> that it has found to support its members' interests.  The NALC worked hard for and supported Postal Reorganization of 1971; its expertise was more in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/48934.xml">
lobbying</link> than in traditional labor-management negotiations and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../421/253421.xml">
collective bargaining</link>.  Nonetheless, it is now recognized as the collective bargaining agent for all city carriers.</p>
<p>

This arrangement carries some difficulties for the union. By the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../837/55837.xml">
Taft-Hartley Act</link> and other federal legislation, the federal government is uniformly an "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../606/1149606.xml">
open shop</link>"; no one can be compelled to join the NALC or any other union as a condition of gaining or continuing employment with the government. However, over 93% of all working Letter Carriers are members of the NALC.  Also, by federal law, carriers (like other governmental workers) are forbidden from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/155134.xml">
striking</link>, meaning that the primary threat that private-sector unions can make if they feel an employer is not bargaining in good faith is not available.  This means that collective bargaining agreements between the NALC and the USPS must be politically feasible; if they are not, this could invite unwanted intervention by United States Congress.</p>

Politically, the NALC is inalterably opposed to postal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../661/24661.xml">
privatization</link> and to any termination of the USPS <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../878/18878.xml">
monopoly</link> on "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/51138.xml">
First Class mail</link>".  The future of the union, and the post office itself, seem to be threatened on an unprecedented level by the march of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/29816.xml">
technology</link>, with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/10826.xml">
fax</link>, electronic bill-paying, and other forms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/5177.xml">
communication</link> that do not involve the physical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18580879.xml">
transportation</link> of pieces of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/16861908.xml">
paper</link> from one location to another.  This has put even more pressure on the NALC to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/627918.xml">
merge</link> with the other major postal union, the <union wordnetid="108233056" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/5527044.xml">
American Postal Workers Union</link></union>
, which represents <link>
postal clerk</link>s; as of this writing, this has not yet occurred, although it has been formally proposed at various times for decades. It should also be noted that most NALC members overwhelmingly reject any mergers with the APWU. It should also be noted that technologies such as the internet has increased mail flow. Any business done online generates hard mail. The NALC is also combating contracting out. The United States Postal Service is creating routes and contracting them to low wage, no benefit workers. These workers are subjected to minimal screening and may sub-contract the work out to others.</p>

 Distinction from other unions </st>
<p>

The NALC in a few minor ways distinguishes itself from private sector unions and even other government unions; for one, it refers to its chapters as "branches" rather than "locals". It developed its own retirement community for its members, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../625/1149625.xml">
Nalcrest, Florida</link>. It operates a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../284/1037284.xml">
mutual benefit association</link> which sells <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/15176.xml">
insurance</link> to members which predates the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/1149647.xml">
Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan</link>, in which it is also a major participant, even as most other employee groups have discontinued their participation. </p>

 Annual food drive </st>

Another yearly charitable event for the NALC is the one day food drive, which is the largest single day food collection in the nation. City &amp; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../156/6007156.xml">
Rural Letter Carrier</link>s collect food from Americans as they deliver them their mail. Letter carriers also promote this event heavily. On May 12, 2007 over 70 million pounds of non-perishable foods were collected. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/612459.xml">
