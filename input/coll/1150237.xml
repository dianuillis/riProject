Shopping</st>
<p>

There are a number of popular shopping destinations located around Westbourne Grove, such as Ledbury Road, Holland Park Avenue, <link>
Portobello Market</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../200/94200.xml">
Clarendon Cross</link>. The eastern end of the road, east of Chepstow Road, is currently undergoing a particularly rapid period of transformation, with expiring leases and rising rents forcing out older family businesses to be replaced by trendy restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>

When the London magazine <it>Time Out</it> was featuring west London in its 9-16 August 1997 issue, it picked on Westbourne Grove as its representative:</p>
<p>

<it>"Seeking a key shopping road symbolic of western aspirations, we decided that preposterously fashionable Westbourne Grove, or "Westbourne Village", has it all.  It was here that Madonna headed during breaks in filming "Evita" - to the funky boutiques, the avant-garde florists, the designer jewellery and futuristic furniture (at millennial prices).  This is certainly up-and-coming - in terms of price tags that is."</it></p>

History</st>

<p>

The development of Westbourne Grove began in the 1840s and proceeded from the east (which lay in <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/93867.xml">
Bayswater</link></site>
) to the west, where it became the principal east-west artery into the Ladbroke Estate.  The far western end of the street only became known as Westbourne Grove relatively recently in 1938, having previously been called Archer Street.  In 1929, the novelist <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../658/201658.xml">
A.J. Cronin</link> opened his own medical practice at 152 Westbourne Grove, which was put up for sale in 2007.  </p>
<p>

Westbourne Grove takes its name from Westbourne Green - a settlement that developed to the west of the bourne that later took the name <stream wordnetid="109448361" confidence="0.8">

. The area is first recorded in 1222 as Westeburn.  Westbourne Green is first recorded as Westborne Grene in 1548. Westbourne Green formed part of the parish of <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

There was a small settlement to the north of what is now Westbourne Grove at Westbourne Green.  It had five main houses.  The largest of these was Westbourne Place or Westbourne House, which was rebuilt in 1745 by the architect Isaac Ware as an elegant Georgian mansion of three storeys with a frontage of nine windows divided into three parts.  The central third was topped by a large pediment and contained the main door, which also had a pediment over it.  The lower two storeys were formed into bays at each end, which contained three windows each.  Amongst the well-known residents of this house were Sir William Yorke, baronet; the Venetian ambassador; the architect <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

); and the General Commander in Chief of the Army, Viscount Hill, who left in 1836 (and who gave his name to the modern road bridge north of Westbourne Grove called Lord Hill's Bridge).  The house was demolished in 1836 to make way for the houses and gardens of what is now Westbourne Park Villas.  <poet wordnetid="110444194" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

 lived in this area, mainly at no 16 Westbourne Park Villas, which was his home 1863-67.</p>

Also north of what is now Westbourne Grove was Westbourne Farm which was the home, between 1815 - 1817, of the actress <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Though now popular and expensive for home-buyers, much of the area become run-down in the 1950s when it was the centre of the activities of <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9638700866880419">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/1363921.xml">
Peter Rachman</link></person>
, the notorious slum-landlord after whom the phrase "Rachmanism" was coined. He was known for his violent evictions of tenants with legally-fixed rents. He replaced them, in what became overcrowded multi-occupied housing, with people, mainly recent migrants from the West Indies, who, because of discrimination and council tenant restrictions, could not find accommodation. He operated from an office in Westbourne Grove<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>. Part of the area, including streets between Ledbury Rd &amp; Shrewsbury Road to the south of Westbourne Park Road, became derelict and was consequently compulsory purchased and demolished <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.</p>
<p>

Notting Hill Post Office, on Westbourne Grove, finally closed in a storm of controversy during early 2005.  However, the Royal Mail retained its sorting office on the site.</p>
