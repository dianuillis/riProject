Notting Hill Gate is home to a variety of stores, restaurants, cafes and estate agents as well as more specialist stores which include rare records and antiques, as well as two historic cinemas, the <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

 1950s redevelopment </st>

<p>

Much of the street was redeveloped in the 1950s with two large <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../767/118767.xml">
tower blocks</link> being erected on the north and south sides of the street. At this time <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

 was also redeveloped linking two stations on the Circle and District and Central lines which had previously been accessed on either side of the street with an entirely underground station concourse which acted as an interchange between the deep level central line and the sub-surface circle and district lines. The new tube station also acted as a pedestrian subway under the widened Notting Hill Gate, the subway contained a ticket office, toilet (now closed) and newsagent. </p>
<p>

Not all of Notting Hill Gate's original features were lost when it was redeveloped however, one good example of this is the <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">
