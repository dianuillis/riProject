<b>Drew McDermott</b> is a Professor of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/5323.xml">

. He was born in 1949, and lived in the Midwestern United States (mainly <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

 as an undergraduate. He left in 1976 with three degrees, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/124904.xml">
B.S.</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/236722.xml">

. He went to <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/34273.xml">

, where he has been ever since. He became a tenured full professor in 1983. He served as Chair of the Department from 1991 to 1995.<p>

His research has been in the area of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link>, with side excursions into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/13692155.xml">
philosophy</link>. His Ph.D. dissertation was in the area of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/1505641.xml">
automated planning</link>. In that work, he coined the term "task network" to refer to hierarchies of abstract and concrete actions and policies. He did seminal work in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../086/341086.xml">
Non-monotonic logic</link> in the early 1980s, and was an advocate for the "logicist" methodology in AI, defined as formalizing knowledge and reasoning in terms of deduction and quasideduction. In 1987 he published a paper criticizing the logicist approach. The critique was based partly on a previous paper (with <link>
Steve Hanks</link>) pointing out a flaw with all known approaches to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning, embodied in what is now called the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../728/2778728.xml">
Yale shooting problem</link>. Although new approaches have since been found, McDermott turned to other areas of AI, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/6596.xml">
vision</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/46673.xml">
robotics</link>, and began working on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/1505641.xml">
automated planning</link> again. The work on planning focused on the "classical" case rather than on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../129/3023129.xml">
hierarchical task network</link> planning. In 1990 he was named a Fellow of the <association wordnetid="108049401" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../794/534794.xml">
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence</link></association>
, one of the first group of Fellows. In 1996 he (and <link>
Hector Geffner</link> and <link>
Blai Bonet</link> independently) discovered "estimated-regression planning", based on the idea of heuristic search with an estimator derived from a simplified domain model by reasoning backward ("regression") from the goal. The simplified version is obtained automatically from a full domain model by ignoring propositions deleted by actions. In 2000 he got interested in logic again because the development of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../123/29123.xml">
semantic web</link> made it seem newly applicable. He did work on ontology translation and on semantic web services.</p>
<p>

McDermott was a prime mover, with <computer_scientist wordnetid="109951070" confidence="0.9173553029164789">
<person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/2726304.xml">

 and others, behind the AI Planning Systems Conference, which, after merging with the European Conference on Planning, became the annual International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). He also helped start the International Planning Competition, which is held semiannually in conjunction with ICAPS. He led the group that molded the Planning Domain Definition Language from several predecessor notations in order to provide a standard notation for input to planning systems.</p>
<p>

A sidelight of his work has been an interest in the philosophy of mind, stemming from his realization as a child that "electronic brains" do not have a "part that thinks", and that therefore biological brains probably don't either. This interest culminated in the publication in 2001 of a book on computational models of consciousness.</p>
<p>

McDermott was married in 1975; that marriage ended in 1997, but not before producing two children, Noel Timothy and Katherine Anne, born in 1985 and 1989. He remarried soon after divorcing. He has lived in New Haven, CT since 1999.</p>
