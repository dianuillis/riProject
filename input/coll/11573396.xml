<p>

Alex Hauptmann started at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../420/38420.xml">
Johns Hopkins University</link></university>
 in 1978 and received a BA and a MA in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/22921.xml">
Psychology</link> in 1982. For two years he studied <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/5323.xml">
Computer Science</link> eat the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../203/197203.xml">
Technische Universitaet Berlin</link>. In 1991 he received a PhD  in Computer Science from the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../093/48093.xml">
Carnegie Mellon University</link></university>
.</p>
<p>

From 1984 he was researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University in the CMU speech group.  The next two years he was a research associate at the School of Computer Science, since 1994 a System Scientist and since 1998 a Senior System Scientist. </p>
<p>

In 2003 he received the Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence, for the Informedia Digital Library,
with H. Wactlar, M. Christel, T. Kanade and S. Stevens.</p>

His research interests are in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../468/29468.xml">
speech recognition</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/42799.xml">
speech synthesis</link>, speech interfaces and language in general.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Over the years his research interests have led him to pursue and combine several different areas of research: man-machine communication, natural language processing and speech understanding.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

In the area of man-machine communication, he is interested in the tradeoffs between different modalities,
including gestures and speech, and in the intuitiveness of interaction protocols. In natural language
processing, his desire is to break through the bottlenecks that are currently preventing larger scale natural
language applications. The latter theme was also the focus of my thesis, which investigated the use of
machine learning on large text samples to acquire the knowledge needed for semantic natural language
understanding.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> </p>
<p>

The approach developed in his thesis research was quite successful at using example sentences and target meanings to learn rules for semantic interpretation from syntactic structures.  In the field of speech understanding, he is intrigued by the potential of combining natural language technology with clever interfaces in speech recognition applications.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> </p>
