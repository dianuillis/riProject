Company history</st>
<p>

In 1984, a research group called the <b>Secure Computing Technology Center</b> (<b>SCTC</b>) was formed at <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../721/225721.xml">
Honeywell</link></company>
 in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/6097240.xml">
Minneapolis, Minnesota</link></village>
.  The centerpiece of SCTC was its work on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../032/685032.xml">
security-evaluated operating system</link>s for the NSA. This work included the Secure Ada Target (SAT) and the Logical Coprocessing Kernel (LOCK), both designed to meet the stringent A1 level of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../300/6687300.xml">
Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria</link> (TCSEC).</p>
<p>

In the late 1980s, Honeywell negotiated the sale of its computing activities to <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/945024.xml">
Groupe Bull</link></institution>
</company>
.  However, the LOCK program was in progress at that time, and the NSA did not want it operated by a foreign corporation. Instead of being sold to Groupe Bull, Honeywell's SCTC organization was spun off in 1989 to produce <b>Secure Computing Technology Corporation</b>, and moved to nearby <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../460/121460.xml">
Roseville, Minnesota</link></village>
.  After a couple of years, the word <it>Technology</it> was dropped from the company name.</p>
<p>

Secure Computing morphed itself from a small <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../088/378088.xml">
defense contractor</link> into a commercial product vendor over the next several years. This was largely driven by the investment community, which was much less interested in purchasing security goods from defense contractors than from commercial product vendors, especially vendors in the growing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> space. </p>
<p>

Secure Computing became a publicly traded company in 1995. Following the pattern of other <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../503/3682503.xml">
Internet-related startups</link></institution>
</company>
, the stock price tripled its first day: it opened at $16 a share and closed at $48. The price peaked around $64 in the next several weeks and then collapsed over the following year or so. It has ranged roughly between $3 and $20 ever since.</p>
<p>

The company headquarters were moved to <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../446/53446.xml">
San Jose, California</link></village>
 in 1998, though the bulk of the workforce remained in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../607/102607.xml">
Twin Cities</link>.  The Roseville employees completed a move to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/40469.xml">
St. Paul, Minnesota</link> in February 2006.  Several other sites now exist, largely the result of mergers (described below).</p>

Mergers and acquisitions</st>
<p>

Secure Computing consists of several merged units, one of the oldest being Enigma Logic, Inc., which was started around 1982. Bob Bosen, the founder, claims to have created the first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/1209826.xml">
security token</link> to provide <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/412627.xml">
challenge-response authentication</link>. Bosen published a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/1336512.xml">
computer game</link> for the <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/30747.xml">
TRS-80</link></computer>
 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/13950.xml">
home computer</link> in 1979, called <it>80 Space Raiders</it>, that used a simple challenge response mechanism for copy protection. People who used the mechanism encouraged him to repackage it for remote authentication. Bosen started Enigma Logic to do so, and filed for patents in 1982&ndash;3; a patent was issued in the United Kingdom in 1986. Ultimately, the <it>challenge</it> portion of the challenge response was eliminated to produce a one-time password token similar to the <know-how wordnetid="105616786" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/293363.xml">

</know-how>
 product. </p>
<p>

Enigma Logic merged with Secure Computing Corporation in 1996.</p>
<p>

Secure Computing acquired the SmartFilter product line by purchasing a small company producing the Webster Webtrack product in the mid-1990s after going public. The acquisition included the domain name <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.webster.com/">
webster.com</weblink> which was eventually sold to the publishers of <hallmark wordnetid="104732543" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/158441.xml">
Webster's Dictionary</link></characteristic>
</hallmark>
.</p>
<p>

Shortly after acquiring the Webster/SmartFilter product, Secure Computing merged with Border Technologies, a Canadian company selling the <link>
Borderware</link> firewall. Border Technologies boasted an excellent product and a highly developed set of sales channels; some said that the sales channels were a major inducement for the merger. Although the plan was to completely merge the Borderware product with Sidewinder, and to offer a single product to existing users of both products, this never quite succeeded. Ultimately, the Borderware product was sold to a consortium of Borderware users.</p>
<p>

By this time, the mergers yielded a highly distributed company with an office in <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

. This proved unwieldy, and the company scaled back to offices in Minnesota and California.</p>
<p>

In 2002, the company took over the Gauntlet Firewall product from <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../684/198684.xml">

.</p>
<p>

In 2003, Secure Computing acquired <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11660042.xml">
N2H2</link>, the makers of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../078/6942078.xml">
Bess</link> web filtering package.  There has been some consolidation of Bess and SmartFilter, and Bess is now referred to as "Smartfilter, Bess edition" in company literature.</p>
<p>

A merger with <link>
CyberGuard</link> was announced in August 2005 and approved in January 2006 (A year earlier, CyberGuard had attempted to acquire Secure Computing, but the proposal had been rejected).  The largest merger by Secure Computing as of this time, it has resulted in the addition of several product lines to the company, including three classes of firewalls, content and protocol filtering systems, and an enterprise-wide management system for controlling all of those products.  Several offices were also added, including CyberGuard's main facility in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, as well as Webwasher development office in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../123/224123.xml">
Paderborn, Germany</link>, and a SnapGear development office in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../093/192093.xml">
Brisbane, Australia</link>.</p>
<p>

In 2006, the company acquired Atlanta-based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../145/652145.xml">
CipherTrust</link>, a developer of email security solutions. The acquisition was announced in July 2006 and completed in August 2006.  </p>
<p>

On July 30, 2008, Secure Computing announced its intention to sell the SafeWord authentication product line to Alladin Knowledge Systems, leaving the company with a business focused on web/mail security and firewalls.</p>
<p>

On September 22, 2008, McAfee announced its intention to acquire Secure Computing.  The combined company will form the world's largest dedicated security company.</p>
