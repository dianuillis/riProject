curing</link>, gaining a translucent, rosy color and complex flavor. The tenderloin may be either <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../865/52865.xml">
brined</link> or dry-cured; if brined, wine is typically used for the liquid. In either case, other flavors may be added to the cure, including orange or lemon peel, bay leaf, black or white peppercorns, or hot pepper flakes. After the cure is done, the meat is rinsed, wrapped loosely in cheesecloth, and hung until it is dry and hard when squeezed. <it>Lomo</it> is served sliced very thinly, with some extra-virgin <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>, perhaps some lemon juice, and a small salad.<p>

There are three common types of Spanish lomo, the cured tenderloin which is cylindrical in shape and contains very little fat, lomo "corteza" which is a flatter full loin with a layer of fat and rind on the outer and lome "Orza" which are chinks of lightly fried lomo in a jar of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
