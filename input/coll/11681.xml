<p>

The term's validity is questioned by many medieval historians who consider the description "feudal" appropriate only to the specifically voluntary and personal bonds of mutual protection, loyalty and support among members of the administrative, military or ecclesiastical elite, to the exclusion of involuntary obligations attached to tenure of "unfree" land. This stricter concept is discussed under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../298/11298.xml">
feudalism</link>, and the bonds which it excludes under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/20862.xml">

Common features of feudal societies</st>
<p>

Features common among feudal societies, but which do not necessarily define them, include: 
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 An overwhelmingly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/627.xml">
agrarian</link> economy, with limited money exchange, necessitating the dispersion of political authority and the substitution of arrangements involving economic support from local resources; </entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 The strength of the <nongovernmental_organization wordnetid="108009834" confidence="0.8">
<denomination wordnetid="108146782" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../848/606848.xml">

</nongovernmental_organization>
 as an ally and counterpart to the civil-military structure, supported by its right to a share (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/147619.xml">
tithe</link>) of society's output as well as substantial landholdings, and endowed with specific authority and responsibility for moral and material welfare. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 The existence of structures and phenomena not of themselves explicitly feudal (urban and village organisations, royal executive power, free peasant holdings, financial and commercial activity) but each incorporated into the whole. </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Alongside such broad similarities, it is important to note the divergences both within and between feudal societies (in forms or complexity of noble association, the extent of peasant dependency or the importance of money payments) as well as the changes which occurred over time within the overall structure (as in Bloch's characterisation of the 11th-century onset of a "second feudal age").</p>
<p>

In particular, one should avoid envisaging the social order in terms of a regular "feudal pyramid" with each man bound to one superior lord and the rank of each clearly defined, in a regular chain of allegiances extending from the king at the top to the peasantry at the bottom: aside from the contrast between free and unfree obligation, allegiance was often given to more than one lord, while an individual might possess attributes of more than one rank. </p>
<p>

Nor should the medieval theory of the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../404/393404.xml">
estates of the realm</link>" or the "three orders" of feudal society&mdash;"those who make war" (<it>miles</it>, knights), "those who pray" (priests, monks) and "those who labour" (peasants, serfs)" (<it>bellatores</it>, <it>oratores</it>, <it>et</it> <it>laboratores</it>)&mdash;be considered a full description of the social order: while those excluded from the first two came over time to be counted among the third, nobles and clerics alike assumed administrative functions in the feudal state, while financial support was relied upon increasingly as a substitute for direct military service. Nobles were defined by the occupation they obtained and no longer by right of birth and are placed in power by the investiture.</p>
<p>

The values of men who fought under the first of the "three orders" were <it>first</it> his horse, <it>second</it> his son, and <it>third</it> his wife.  A soldier's horse, in feudal society, was considered the price of two and a half generations or two men and a boy.  The role of women consisted of maintaining the household economy: controlled peasants and regulating what crops will and will not be grown and sold.</p>
<p>

"Those who prayed" consisted of priests, monk, and other authorities of the church. The church willingly supported the three orders. "Those who work," peasants and serfs, consisted of the majority of the population and suffered the most.</p>

European medieval feudal society evolved into its most recognised in the northern French heartland of the  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/87655.xml">
Carolingian</link> monarchy of the 8th-10th centuries, but has its antecedents also in late Roman practice. It reached it most developed state in 11th and 12th century, particularly in northern <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Prehistoric Development of Social Stratification</st>
<p>

In the Narmer and Scorpion King palettes of Predynastic Egypt the basic concept of feudalism is illustrated as land in return for service. The king is shown controlling the land by controlling the water. The people of Narmers extended family dig irrigation channels so the land is improved and then are granted its use in return for service which includes the maintenance of the system. </p>
<p>

As more infrastructure is added more people come to owe their sustenance to the king. Specialists in surveying, drafting deeds, digging, planting, building, tool making, the domestication of beasts of burden, all come to have  standards and status for the practice of their professions. Their entitlement to the land isn't directly from service to the king but to the people who hold the land in return for their service to the king.</p>
<p>

As things get more complicated the primary role of the king becomes the administration of the system. The social order becomes hierarchical. Trade with other similar kingdoms begins to require agreed upon standards, of behavior and laws regarding commerce and the ownership of property.</p>
