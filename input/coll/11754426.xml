<b>Multiservice Tactical Brevity Codes</b> are codes used by various military air forces and air defense personnel.  The codes are designed to convey complex information with a few words.</p>

<sec>
<st>
American / NATO codes</st>
<p>

This is a list of American standardized air-to-air, surface-to-air, and air-to-surface brevity code words. The scope is limited to those brevity codes used in multiservice operations and does not include words unique to single service operations. While these codes are not authoritative in nature, all services agree to their meanings. Using the codes eases coordination and improves understanding during multiservice operations. The codes are intended for use by air and ground operations personnel at the tactical level. Code words that are followed by an asterisk (*) may differ in meaning from NATO usage.</p>
