A <b>friend-to-friend</b> (or <b>F2F</b>) computer network is a type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../107/24107.xml">
peer-to-peer network</link> in which users only make direct connections with people they know. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/24304.xml">
Passwords</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/59644.xml">
digital signatures</link> can be used for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/47967.xml">
authentication</link>.<p>

Many F2F networks support indirect <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../382/181382.xml">
anonymous</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/40594.xml">
pseudonymous</link> communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/998116.xml">
node</link> in a friend-to-friend <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../669/1014669.xml">
overlay</link> can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two friends, without telling either of them the other's name or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/14921.xml">
IP address</link>. These friends can in turn forward the same file (or request) to their own friends, and so on.</p>
<p>

Unlike other kinds of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/1651366.xml">
private P2P</link>, users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity. <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

F2F prevents random people from proving that a given IP address can be used to obtain controversial files. Once a user knows the IP addresses of all their friends, they can even use a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../296/1362296.xml">
firewall</link> to prevent any other addresses from accessing their F2F <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../331/4971331.xml">

Since F2F applications use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/1065304.xml">
link encryption</link> and don't need end-to-end encryption to achieve their goals, they could allow users to control what kind of files pass through their nodes.</entry>

 Disadvantages of F2F </st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 A node in F2F network requires more effort to set up and maintain, because all peers must be connected manually. This is especially problematic if a person wants to try out several different P2P applications. To the contrary, "opennet" P2P applications are mostly plug-n-play. To address this problem, some networks like Freenet allow both network types: a user can start in opennet mode with very little effort, and later switch to more secure F2F mode.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Often, not enough direct friends are motivated to run the application 24x7. Third party storage (see "Future uses" below) can solve this problem.</entry>

 What F2F is not </st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The many applications and websites that use public servers to enable friends to communicate are not F2F networks. These include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/14730.xml">
IRC</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/55951.xml">
instant messaging</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/2872825.xml">
social networking websites</link>.</entry>

</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 A private <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/53289.xml">
FTP</link> server is not an F2F network, since friends do not communicate with each other, only with the server.</entry>

</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 A private <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../342/70342.xml">
Direct Connect</link> hub is not an F2F network, since any user of a hub can discover the IP addresses of all the other users, even those who are not their friends.</entry>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/10997.xml">

 version 0.5 because the software automatically makes new connections between nodes. However from version 0.7, Freenet is based on what its authors call a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/18089775.xml">

 F2F <b>software</b> is not an F2F <b>network</b> by itself; such software can be used to participate in an existing F2F network, or to launch a new F2F network. Existing networks may be connected to form a larger F2F network. Since new members have to gain the trust of an existing member in order to join a network, it is impossible to know how many separate F2F networks exist. This is why F2F networks are part of the larger family of networks called darknets.</entry>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../930/1116930.xml">
Online reputation</link>s could be constructed and verified using an F2F network: each document on the network would be automatically given a new trust rating by each node forwarding it, for example by multiplying the old trust rating by the reputation of the provider. If a document appeared to be incorrect, the recipient could manually decrease the local reputation of the friend who provided it, decrease the trust rating of the document, or even block the document from being exchanged again through their node.

 Security issues </st>

Besides the fact that current networks don't use provably secure crypto (see "future uses" above), here are some other breaches:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 In countries where anonymous P2P is forbidden, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
ISP</link> may be able to detect that a user is using P2P software by observing their connection patterns <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1843/">
http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1843/</weblink>. Imitating the connection patterns of popular encrypted programs like webphones or webcams, along with a layer of the same encryption used by those programs, would be a very simple form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/28733.xml">
steganography</link>. Alternatively, F2F traffic could be routed through third party storage such as an email server <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://easta.sourceforge.net/">
http://easta.sourceforge.net/</weblink>. Networks that use generic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../130/147130.xml">
VPN</link> software, as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/2050611.xml">
anoNet</link> does, may be less vulnerable to this issue.</entry>

 of a user's links by their ISP could easily show that they are automatically forwarding files. One possible solution, implemented in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/239970.xml">
WASTE</link>, is to send and receive a constant stream of meaningless data, so that traffic analysis cannot detect whether meaningful data is being transmitted at any given time. Another possibility would be to add <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/592505.xml">
padding</link> to files.</entry>

 In countries where strong crypto is forbidden (or where users can be forced to surrender their keys), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/28733.xml">
steganography</link> could be used for every connection (and for storing files on a hard disk, since it could be seized). Because steganography involves a secret convention that must be established <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/3471522.xml">
out-of-band</link>, only F2F networks could be safe in such countries.</entry>

These breaches are not F2F specific: they are shared with most of the current P2P networks.</p>
