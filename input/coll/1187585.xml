 writer S. Rangarajan, author of over 100 novels, 250 short stories, ten books on science, ten stage plays, and a slim volume of poems. He was one of the most popular writers in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../988/372988.xml">
Tamil literature</link>, and a regular contributor to topical columns in Tamil periodicals such as <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

<sec>
<st>
 Career </st>

<p>

A path breaker in all senses, he had a great influence in the Tamil literary (both modern and traditional) scene for over four decades. A Engineer by profession, he had the rare combination of being proficient in Tamil (literary, contemporary, modern) as well as in Technology. Widely read and knowledgeable, he presented all his knowledge in simple Tamil and inspired a whole generation.</p>
<p>

He came as whiff of fresh air in the times when the Tamil writing was dominated by Social/family dramas or historical novels. His unique style of writing with the uncanny adoption and identification with the masses - their way of talking, behavior, mindset and the slang included in his writings made him immensely popular cutting across the segments.</p>
<p>

His contribution to the popularization of technology is immense - starting with his Silicon Chip writing in Dinamani Kadhir and Yen, Yedharku, Eppadi in <link>
Junior Vikatan</link> - he seemed to have time for anything and everything. At one point of time his writing alone sold most of the Tamil weeklies and Journals - he was writing in <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

, Kungumam, Kalki and Dhinamani Kadhir almost simultaneously. Later he contributed as script/screenplay writer in several Tamil movies. His notable movies include Vikram, Thiruda Thiruda, Boys and Sivaji. Most of his early novels/stories are made as movies - notable include Priya, Gaytri, Karaiyellam Senbagapoo...</p>
<p>

Versatile and gifted he will be mostly remembered for variety of novels, stories, essays he contributed. He introduced Haiku poetry to the Tamil audience. Brought up in Srirangam, Trichy and who spent most of the later part of life in Bangalore he described both the places vividly in his various writings. Among his popular novels are Pirivom Sandhipom (not related to the recent movie on the same name), Rathham ore niram, Kolaiyudhir Kaalam among others.</p>
<p>

Last but not least, he immortalized Ganesh-Vasanth - the imaginary advocate pair being the main characters in most of his detective, semi-detective stories. Ganesh being a level-headed, senior advocate with Vasanth being his flirtatious Junior advocate made a fascinating reading in most of the contemporary situations his novels dealt with. The Ganesh-Vasanth pair is a copy of <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

<p>

In his later days he restricted his writing to essays such as Katradhum-Petradhum which again was a hit with audience. He was more into reading in his later days especially on the old rare Tamil writings as well as the latest developments on IT and computing. Not to forget the fact that in his younger days he was involved in the design of the Electronic Voting Machine used in the Indian Elections. Surely a man of versatility and knowledge.</p>
<p>
