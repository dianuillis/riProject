History</st>

<p>

The Association for Community Health Improvement was conceived in 2002 as a successor to three national community health initiatives: the <link>
Community Care Network Demonstration Program</link>, <link>
ACT National Outcomes Network</link>, and <link>
Coalition for Healthier Cities and Communities</link>. These three programs had made contributions to community health since the mid-1990s, focusing on topics including health care delivery and preventive health systems, careful planning for and measurement of progress toward defined community health goals, and broad community engagement in resolving systemic challenges to community health and social well-being.</p>
