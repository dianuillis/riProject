Wellman has been a faculty member of the Department of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/18717981.xml">
Sociology</link> at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/7955325.xml">
University of Toronto</link></university>
 since 1967. Until 1990, he focused on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/5695.xml">
community</link> sociology and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network</link> analysis. During his first three years in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/64646.xml">
Toronto</link></village>
, he also held a joint appointment with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/1248871.xml">
Clarke Institute of Psychiatry</link> where he working with <link>
D.B. Coates</link>, M.D., co-directing the "Yorklea Study" in the Toronto borough of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/682159.xml">
East York</link>. This first East York study, with data collected in 1968, attempted to do a field study of a large population, linking interpersonal relations with psychiatric symptoms. This early study of "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/1571927.xml">
social support</link>" documented the prevalence of non-local <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../119/17157119.xml">
friendship</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../570/265570.xml">
kinship</link> ties, demonstrating that community is no longer confined to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/177193.xml">
neighborhood</link> and studying non-local communities as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network</link>s. Wellman's "The Community Question" paper, reporting on this study, has been selected as one of the seven most important articles in English-Canadian sociology. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
<p>

A second <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/682159.xml">
East York</link> study, conducted in 1978-1979 at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/7955325.xml">
University of Toronto</link></university>
's Centre for Urban and Community Studies, used in-depth interviews with 33 East Yorkers (originally surveyed in the first study) to learn more information about their social networks. It provided evidence about which kinds of ties and networks supply which types of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/1571927.xml">
social support</link>. It showed, for example, that sisters provide siblings with much emotional support, while parents provide financial aid.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> The support comes more from the characteristics of the ties than from the networks in which they are embedded.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>  This research also demonstrated that wives maintain social networks for their husbands as well as for themselves. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>
<p>

Although Wellman's work has shifted primarily to studies of the Internet (see section below), he has continued collaborative analyses of the first and second East York studies, showing that reciprocity (like social support) is much more of a tie phenomenon than a social network phenomenon<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> and that the frequency and supportiveness of interpersonal contact before the Internet was non-linearly associated with residential (and workplace) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../378/39378.xml">
distance</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> </p>
<p>

Wellman has edited <it>Networks in the Global Village</it> (1999), a book of original articles about personal networks around the world. In 2007, he edited a special issue, "The Network is Personal" of the journal, <it>Social Networks</it> (vol. 29, no. 3, July), containing analyses from <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Social Network Theory</st>
<p>

Concomitant with his empirical work, Wellman has contributed to the theory of social network analysis. The most comprehensive statement is in his introductory article to <it>Social Structures</it>, co-edited with the late <link>
S.D. Berkowitz</link>. This work reviews the history of social network thought, and suggests a number of basic principles of social network analysis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>

More recent and more focused theoretical work has discussed the "glocalization" of contemporary communities (simultaneously "global" and "local")<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref> and the rise of "networked individualism" -- the transformation from group-based networks to individualized networks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

Social Network Methods</st>
<p>

Wellman's methodological contributions have been for the analysis of ego-centered or "personal" networks -- defined from the standpoint of an individual (usually a person). As batches of personal networks are often studied, this calls for somewhat different techniques than the more common <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network</link> practice of analyzing a single large network.</p>
<p>

A 2007 paper, co-authored by Wellman (with Bernie Hogan and Juan-Antonio Carrasco), has discussed alternatives in gathering personal network data.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> A paper with Kenneth Frank showed how to tackle the problem of simultaneously analyzing personal network data on the two distinct levels of ties and networks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref> "Neighboring in Netville" has been cited as the only published study of personal networks from a known roster of potential network members.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> The most widely cited papers are the simplest: co-authored guides to analyzing personal network data while using the statistical software packages <it><software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Wellman has often worked in collaboration with computer scientists, communication scientists and information scientists.
In 1990, he became involved in studying how ordinary people use the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> and other communication technologies to communicate and exchange information at work, at home and in the community. Thus his work has expanded his interest in non-local communities and social networks to encompass the Internet, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/19644137.xml">
mobile phones</link> and other information and communication technologies.</p>

<p>

Wellman's initial project ("Cavecat" which morphed into "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../083/305083.xml">
Telepresence</link>") was in collaboration with Ronald Baecker, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Marilyn Mantei, Gale Moore, and Janet Salaff. This effort in the early 1990s was done before the advent of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>, to use networked PCs for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/274116.xml">
videoconferencing</link> and computer supported collaborative work (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../991/293991.xml">
CSCW</link>).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref>
Caroline Haythornthwaite (for her dissertation and other works) and Wellman analyzed why computer scientists connect with each other -- online and offline. They discovered that friendships as well as collaborative work were prime movers of connectivity at work.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref>. </p>
<p>

Wellman and Anabel Quan-Haase also studied whether such computer-supported work teams were supporting networked organizations, in which bureaucratic structure and physical proximity did not matter. Their research in one high-tech American organization -- heavily dependent on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/55951.xml">
instant messaging</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">

 was only partially fulfilled in practice. The organizational constraints of departmental organization (including power) and physical proximity continued to play important roles. There were strong norms in the organization for when different communication media were used, with face-to-face contact intertwined with online contact. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>

Community Networks and ICTs</st>
<p>

As a community sociologist, Wellman began arguing that too much analysis of life online was happening in isolation from other aspects of everyday life. He published several papers (alone and with associates) arguing the need to contextualize Internet research, and proposing that online relations -- like off-line -- would be best studied as ramified social networks rather than as bounded groups.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref> This argument culminated in a 2002 book, <it>The Internet in Everyday Life</it> (co-edited with Caroline Haythornthwaite), providing exemplification from studies in a number of social milieus.</p>
<p>

Wellman did empirical work in this area: he was part of a team (led by James Witte) that surveyed visitors to the <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

dystopia</link>n argument that Internet involvement was associated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/5028523.xml">
social isolation</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref> </p>
<p>

The large U.S. national random-sample survey analyzed in the Pew Internet report, "The Strength of Weak Ties" (with Jeffrey Boase, John Hannigan and Lee Rainie) also showed a positive association between communication online and communication by telephone and face-to-face. The study showed that email is well-suited for maintaining regular contact with large networks, and especially with relationships that are only somewhat strong. The study also found that Internet users get more help than non-users from friends and relatives. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref></p>
<p>

Research into the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../946/3823946.xml">
glocalization</link>" concept also fed into this intellectual stream. <link>
Keith Hampton</link> and Wellman studied the <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 suburb of "Netville", a pseudonym. It showed the interplay between online and offline activity, and how the Internet -- aided by a list-serve -- is not just a means of long-distance communication but enhances neighboring and civic involvement. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref></p>
<p>

Wellman's current work continues to focus on the interplay between information and communication technologies, especially the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
