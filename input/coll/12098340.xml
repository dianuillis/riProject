The <b>Fashion Model Directory</b> (<b>FMD</b>)  is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../440/41440.xml">
online</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link> of information about female <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/48916.xml">
fashion models</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../188/2067188.xml">
modeling agencies</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/10799117.xml">
fashion designers</link>. FMD is often denoted as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../876/14876.xml">
IMDb</link> of the fashion industry. The project was started in 1996 by Stuart Howard and was taken over by FashionOne Group in 2002.

Overview</st>
<p>

The Fashion Model Directory consists of the largest database about professional female fashion models, modeling agencies and fashion designers. In many cases, the information about the fashion models goes beyond simple statistics or biographical details to include complete information about advertisements, magazine covers, fashion shows, hobbies, notes and links to official and other websites.  Furthermore, FMD provides an extensive picture gallery for each fashion model including copyright information and photographer credit where available. The modeling agencies database includes contact information such as the address, official website, divisions, type of business, offices and notes. Each agency is being marked with a MVA-logo after being reviewed and verified by a selected team of modeling experts.  FMD offers an identification tool for unknown models, a regular model of the month interview, modeling news and gossip, user polls, ratings and special features such as the favorites lists and submission options. The website has also an active but insignificant message board. FMD is a free site, which requires registration to access its complete range of functions. To register you need to have a valid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">
e-mail</link> account and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/33173.xml">
web browser</link> that accepts <text wordnetid="106387980" confidence="0.8">

.  Registered users can also create a "my favorites list," which is a list of favorite fashion models that can be shared with the public.  
Site visitors wishing only to view information without accessing interactive features can do so without registration.
The site is available in two languages: <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.8">

History</st>
<p>

FMD was started as a private offline project in early 1996 by Stuart Howard. One year later the database went online and was updated every week and the only way to submit information was to send an email. The design used to be very basic and there were no advanced features except a simple search engine.  The first online <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/32277.xml">
URL</link> for FMD was www.threestrings.com/stuart/, which was part of a personal website before changing to the current webaddress in 2001. In 2002 the database was destined to disappear from the web because the time exposure of the project exceeded the possible. 
After a short offline-time, the project was taken over by FashionOne Group, which invested time and money to restart with a new design as well as new functions.  
Three years later, in 2005, the project has been reprogrammed and redesigned again.</p>

Present</st>
<p>

At present, the FMD database includes over 7,000 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/48916.xml">
fashion models</link>, 160 fashion designers and 900 modeling agencies. 
In 2007, FMD announced the launch of <b>MVA</b> (Most Valuable Agency), a new verification, testing and certification program for modeling agencies. Main objective is to provide credible information about modeling agencies and to sort out or render public all fraudulent and dubious agencies before they can do any harm. Therefore MVA also provides scam alerts and warnings as well as complaints submitted by professional fashion models. Furthermore, the information is being synchronized with a selected list of consumer protection services of several countries around the world such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/479512.xml">
BBB</link> or <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/182215.xml">
FTC</link></agency>
.</p>

Questions or submissions are being dealth with and verified by the panel. At times when there are many submissions response time can be slower.
There is a shorter URL <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.fmd1.com">
FMD1.com</weblink> for quick access.</p>
