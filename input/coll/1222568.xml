The Helmholtz machine is a name used by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../174/507174.xml">
Geoff Hinton</link> to describe a class of <link>
neural networks</link> which <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/183403.xml">
learn</link> the hidden structure of a set of data by being trained to create a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/1222578.xml">
generative model</link> which can produce the original set of data. The hope is that by learning economical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/13468528.xml">
representations</link> of the data, the underlying structure of the generative model should reasonably approximate the hidden structure of the data set. This is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/233497.xml">
unsupervised learning</link> algorithm.<p>

The networks are characterized by bottom-up and top-down (reentrant) connections between layers of stochastic elements. The <link>
"Wake-Sleep" algorithm</link> is an unsupervised learning rule which has been suggested as a means to train the Helmholtz machine.</p>
<p>

Helmholtz machines  may also be used in applications requiring a supervised learning algorithm (e.g. character recognition, or position-invariant recognition of an object within a field).</p>
