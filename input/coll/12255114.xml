The Stamp Act of 1765 was the fourth Stamp Act to be passed by the Parliament of Great Britain and required all legal documents, permits, commercial contracts, newspapers, wills, pamphlets, and playing cards in the American colonies to carry a tax stamp. The exact date the Act was enacted was on November 1, 1765. The Act was enacted in order to defray the cost of maintaining the military presence protecting the colonies.</p>

===Income for federal government===
Tariffs have played different roles in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/7969286.xml">
trade policy</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/1610496.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../461/4764461.xml">

, until it was surpassed by income taxes. Since the revenue from the tariff was considered essential and easy to collect at the major <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/97169.xml">
port</link>s, it was agreed the nation should have a tariff for revenue purposes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Protectionism</st>
<p>

Another role the tariff played was in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/153023.xml">
protection of local industry</link>; it was the political dimension of the tariff. From the 1790s to the 2000s, the tariff (and closely related issues such as import quotas and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/29678.xml">
trade</link> treaties) generated enormous political stresses whether during the 19th century with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../083/376083.xml">

, which reasoned that applying tariffs in moderation would, in addition to raising revenue to fund the federal government, would also encourage domestic manufacturing and growth of the economy by applying the funds raised in part towards subsidies (called bounties in his time) to manufacturers. The main purposes sought by Hamilton through the tariff were to: (1) protect American infant industry for a short term until it could compete; (2) raise revenue to pay the expenses of government; (3) raise revenue to directly support manufacturing through bounties (subsidies).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  This resulted in the passage of three tariffs by Congress, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/55561.xml">

Sectionalism</st>
<p>

Tariffs contributed to sectionalism between the North and the South.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../097/1350097.xml">
Tariff of 1824</link> increased tariffs in order to protect American industry in the face of cheaper imported commodities such as iron products, wool and cotton textiles, and agricultural goods from England. This tariff was the first in which the sectional interests of the North and the South truly came into conflict because the South advocated lower tariffs in order to take advantage of tariff reciprocity from England and other countries that purchased raw agricultural materials from the South.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../572/55572.xml">
Tariff of 1828</link>, also known as the Tariff of Abominations, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../577/1438577.xml">
Tariff of 1832</link> accelerated sectionalism between the North and the South.  For a brief moment in 1832, South Carolina made vague threats to leave the Union over the tariff issue.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  In 1833, to ease North-South relations, Congress lowered the tariffs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> In the 1850s, the South gained greater influence over tariff policy and made subsequent reductions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

In 1861, just prior to the Civil War, Congress enacted the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../588/55588.xml">
Morrill Tariff</link>, which applied high rates and inaugurated a period of relatively continuous trade protection in the United States that lasted until the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../034/1615034.xml">
Underwood Tariff</link> of 1913. The schedule of the Morrill Tariff and its two successor bills were retained long after the end of the Civil War.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

In 1921, Congress sought to protect local agriculture as opposed to industry by passing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../314/11061314.xml">

<p>

However, one year later Congress passed another tariff, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/55755.xml">
Fordney-McCumber Tariff</link>, whch applied the scientific tariff and the American Selling Price. The purpose of the scientific tariff was to equalize production costs among countries so that no country could undercut the prices charged by American companies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> The difference of production costs was calculated by the Tariff Commission.  A second novelty was the American Selling Price. This allowed the president to calculate the duty based on the price of the American price of a good, not the imported good.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

During the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1930, Congress raised tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods to record levels, and, in the opinion of most economists, worsened the Great Depression by causing other countries to reciprocate thereby plunging American imports and exports by more than half.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

In addition, the Constitution specifically limited Congress' ability to impose direct taxes, by requiring it to distribute direct taxes in proportion to each state's census population. It was thought that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/24547.xml">
head tax</link>es and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../814/373814.xml">
property tax</link>es (slaves could be taxed as either or both) were likely to be abused, and that they bore no relation to the activities in which the federal government had a legitimate interest. The fourth clause of section 9 therefore specifies that, "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken." </p>

<p>

The courts have generally held that direct taxes are limited to taxes on people (variously called "capitation", "poll tax" or "head tax") and property<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>.

Congress enacted an income tax in October 1913 as part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../034/1615034.xml">
Revenue Act of 1913</link>, levying a 1% tax on net personal incomes above $3,000, with a 6% surtax on incomes above $500,000. By 1918, the top rate of the income tax was increased to 77% (on income over $1,000,000) to finance <conflict wordnetid="100958896" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. The top marginal tax rate was reduced to 58% in 1922, to 25% in 1925 and finally to 24% in 1929. In 1932 the top marginal tax rate was increased to 63% during the <condition wordnetid="113920835" confidence="0.8">

 and steadily increased, reaching 94% (on all income over $200,000) in 1945. Top marginal tax rates stayed near or above 90% until 1964 when the top marginal tax rate was lowered to 70%. The top marginal tax rate was lowered to 50% in 1982 and eventually to 28% in 1988. During World War II, Congress introduced payroll withholding and quarterly tax payments.</p>

Development of the modern income tax</st>

<p>

At first the income tax was incrementally expanded by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
Congress of the United States</link>. Inflation automatically raised many persons into tax brackets formerly reserved for the wealthy until Congress began adjusting the income tax brackets for inflation. Income tax now applies to almost ⅔ of the population <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02inrate.pdf">
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02inrate.pdf</weblink>. The lowest earning workers, especially those with dependents, pay no income taxes as a group and actually get a small subsidy from the federal government because of child credits and the <link>
Earned Income Tax Credit</link>.</p>
<p>

The federal government is now financed primarily by personal and corporate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/50845.xml">
income tax</link>es. While the government was originally funded via <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/55551.xml">
tariff</link>s upon imported goods, tariffs now represent only a minor portion of federal revenues. Non-tax fees are generated to recompense agencies for services or to fill specific <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/31043.xml">
trust fund</link>s such as the fee placed upon <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/10532510.xml">
airline ticket</link>s for airport expansion and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../563/48563.xml">
air traffic control</link>. Often the receipts intended to be placed in "trust" funds are used for other purposes, with the government posting an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/297474.xml">
IOU</link> ('I owe you') in the form of a <link>
federal bond</link> or other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/2593.xml">
accounting</link> instrument, then spending the money on unrelated current expenditures.</p>
<p>

Net long-term <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../870/301870.xml">
capital gain</link>s as well as certain types of qualified <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../930/41930.xml">
dividend</link> income are taxed preferentially. The federal government collects several specific taxes in addition to the general income tax. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../728/48728.xml">
Social Security</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">

Treatment of "income"</st>

<p>

Tax statutes passed after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 are sometimes referred to as the "modern" tax statutes. Hundreds of Congressional acts have been passed since 1913, as well as several codifications (i.e., topical reorganizations) of the statutes (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../874/218874.xml">
Codification</link>).</p>
<p>

The modern interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment taxation power can be found in <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/3136445.xml">
Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.</link></it> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=348&amp;page=426">
348 U.S.  426</weblink> (1955). In that case, a taxpayer had received an award of punitive damages from a competitor, and sought to avoid paying taxes on that award. The Court observed that Congress, in imposing the income tax, had defined income to include:</p>

<p>

gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service . . . of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>

<p>

The Court held that "this language was used by Congress to exert in this field the full measure of its taxing power", id., and that "the Court has given a liberal construction to this broad phraseology in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

The Court then enunciated what is now understood by Congress and the Courts to be the definition of taxable income, "instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion." Id. at 431. The defendant in that case suggested that a 1954 rewording of the tax code had limited the income that could be taxed, a position which the Court rejected, stating:</p>

<p>

The definition of gross income has been simplified, but no effect upon its present broad scope was intended. Certainly punitive damages cannot reasonably be classified as gifts, nor do they come under any other exemption provision in the Code. We would do violence to the plain meaning of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to bring the taxing power to bear upon all receipts constitutionally taxable were we to say that the payments in question here are not gross income.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>

<p>

In <it>Conner v. United States</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>, a couple had lost their home to a fire, and had received compensation for their loss from the insurance company, partly in the form of hotel costs reimbursed. The court acknowledged the authority of the IRS to assess taxes on all forms of payment, but did not permit taxation on the compensation provided by the insurance company, because unlike a wage or a sale of goods at a profit, this was not a gain. As the court noted, "Congress has taxed income, not compensation".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref> By contrast, at least two other Federal courts have indicated that Congress may constitutionally tax an item as "income," regardless of whether that item is in fact income.

<p>

In 1916, Congress adopted the present federal estate tax, which instead of taxing the wealth that a donee inherited as occurred in the state inheritance taxes it taxed the wealth of a donor's estate upon transfer.</p>
<p>

Later, Congress passed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../840/1626840.xml">
Revenue Act of 1924</link>, which imposed the gift tax, a tax on gifts given by the donor.</p>
<p>

In 1948 Congress allowed marital deductions for the estate and the gift tax.  Congress later expanded this deduction in 1981 to an unlimited amount for gifts between spouses.</p>
<p>

Today, the estate tax is a tax imposed on the transfer of the "taxable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/757838.xml">
estate</link>" of a deceased person, whether such property is transferred via a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../697/77697.xml">
will</link> or according to the state laws of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/181508.xml">
intestacy</link>. The estate tax is one part of the <it>Unified Gift and Estate Tax</it> system in the United States. The other part of the system, the gift tax, imposes a tax on transfers of property during a person's life; the gift tax prevents avoidance of the estate tax should a person want to give away his/her estate just before dying.</p>
<p>

In addition to the federal government, many states also impose an estate tax, with the state version called either an estate tax or an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/5824627.xml">
inheritance tax</link>. Since the 1990s, the term "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/19279011.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22The+Death+Tax+neologism%22])">
death tax</link>" has been widely used by those who want to eliminate the estate tax, because the terminology used in discussing a political issue affects popular opinion.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>
<p>

If an asset is left to a spouse or a charitable organization, the tax usually does not apply. The tax is imposed on other transfers of property made as an incident of the death of the owner, such as a transfer of property from an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/181508.xml">
intestate</link> estate or trust, or the payment of certain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/383367.xml">

In the 1930s, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/19283361.xml">

Social Security</link> to rectify the first three problems (retirement, injury-induced disability, or congenital disability). It introduced the FICA tax as the means to pay for Social Security.</p>
<p>

In the 1960s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">
Medicare</link> was introduced to rectify the fourth problem (health care for the elderly). The FICA tax was increased in order to pay for this expense.</p>

 introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. FICA began with voluntary participation, participants would have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, the money the participants put into the independent "Trust Fund" rather than into the General operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income.</p>

 administration Social Security moved from the trust fund to the general fund.  Participants may not have an income tax deduction for Social Security withholding.  Immigrants became eligible for Social Security benefits during the Carter administration.  During the Clinton administration Social Security annuities became taxable.</p>
<p>

Some lower income individuals pay a proportionately higher share of payroll taxes for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../728/48728.xml">
Social Security</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">

All income earned up to a point, adjusted annually for inflation ($94,200 for the year 2006 and $97,500 for the year 2007) is taxed at 7.65% (consisting of the 6.2% Social Security tax and the 1.45% Medicare tax) on the employee with an addition 7.65% in tax incurred by the employer. The annual limitation amount is sometimes called the "Social Security tax wage base amount" or "Contribution and Benefit Base." Above the annual limit amount, only the 1.45% Medicare tax is imposed. In terms of the effective rate, this means that a worker earning $20,000 for 2006 pays at a 7.65% effective rate ($1,530) while a worker earning $200,000 pays at an effective rate of about 4.37% ($8,740).</p>

The alternative minimum tax was introduced by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../120/1622120.xml">
Tax Reform Act of 1969</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref> and became operative in 1970. It was intended to target 155 high-income households that had been eligible for so many tax benefits that they owed little or no income tax under the tax code of the time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref></p>
<p>

In recent years, the AMT has been under increased attention. With the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/55789.xml">
Tax Reform Act of 1986</link>, the AMT was broadened and refocused on home owners in high tax states. Because the AMT is not indexed to inflation and recent tax cuts,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref> an increasing number of middle-income taxpayers have been finding themselves subject to this tax.</p>
<p>

In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report highlighted the AMT as the single most serious problem with the tax code. The advocate noted that the AMT punishes taxpayers for having children or living in a high-tax state, and that the complexity of the AMT leads to most taxpayers who owe AMT not realizing it until preparing their returns or being notified by the IRS. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/arc-exec_summary-2006.pdf">

Capital gains tax</st>

<indent level="1">

<it>Main article: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../327/11647327.xml">
Capital gains tax in the United States</link></it>
</indent>

The origins of the income tax on gains from capital assets did not distinguish capital gains from ordinary income.  From 1913 to 1921, income from capital gains were taxed at ordinary rates, initially up to a maximum rate of 7 percent.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> </p>
<p>

Congress began to distinguish the taxation of capital gains from the taxation of ordinary income according to the holding period of the asset with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../248/1626248.xml">
Revenue Act of 1921</link>, allowed a tax rate of 12.5 percent gain for assets held at least two years.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> </p>
<p>

In addition to different tax rates depending on holding period, Congress began excluding certain percentages of capital gains depending on holding period.  From 1934 to 1941, taxpayers could exclude percentages of gains that varied with the holding period: 20, 40, 60, and 70 percent of gains were excluded on assets held 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref>  Beginning in 1942, taxpayers could exclude 50 percent of capital gains from income on assets held at least six months or elect a 25 percent alternative tax rate if their ordinary tax rate exceeded 50 percent.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> </p>
<p>

Capital gains tax rates were significantly increased in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../120/1622120.xml">
1969</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/1622260.xml">
1976</link> Tax Reform Acts.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> </p>
<p>

The 1970s and 80s saw a period of oscillating capital gains tax rates.  In 1978, Congress reduced capital gains tax rates by eliminating the minimum tax on excluded gains and increasing the exclusion to 60 percent, thereby reducing the maximum rate to 28 percent.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref>  The 1981 tax rate reductions further reduced capital gains rates to a maximum of 20 percent.  </p>
<p>

Later in the 1980s Congress began increasing the capital gains tax rate and repealing the exclusion of capital gains.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/55789.xml">
Tax Reform Act of 1986</link> repealed the exclusion from income that provided for tax-exemption of long term capital gains, raising the maximum rate to 28 percent (33 percent for taxpayers subject to phaseouts).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> When the top ordinary tax rates were increased by the 1990 and 1993 budget acts, an alternative tax rate of 28 percent was provided.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> Effective tax rates exceeded 28 percent for many high-income taxpayers, however, because of interactions with other tax provisions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> </p>
<p>

The end of the 1990s and the beginning of the present century heralded major reductions in taxing the income from gains on capital assets.  Lower rates for 18-month and five-year assets were adopted in 1997 with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../832/1606832.xml">
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> In 2001, President <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
