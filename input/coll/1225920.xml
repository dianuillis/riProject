<b>Streamium</b> is a line of IP-enabled entertainment products by Dutch electronics multi-national <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/7161677.xml">

. Streamium products allow users to consume digital entertainment and multimedia content --whether stored on their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../742/52742.xml">
desktop computer</link>s or delivered through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>-based services-- on their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../370/183370.xml">
home entertainment</link> and/or audio sets. Using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/63973.xml">
Wi-Fi</link> music streams wirelessly to almost any type of audio equipment, anywhere in a house. With a <link>
Wireless Multimedia Adapter</link>, it is also possible to play downloaded movies directly on an analog television set or to access the internet wirelessly.<p>

Essentially, how it works is that a Streamium device plugged into the local home network will be able to see multimedia files that are in different <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/183365.xml">
UPnP</link>-enabled computers, PDAs and other networking devices (loaded with UPnP AV MediaServer software). I.e. NAS that supports UPnP, or even a UPnP enabled phone like the <cellular_telephone wordnetid="102992529" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../305/4927305.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../836/3913836.xml">
Nokia N80</link></cellular_telephone>
 etc.</p>
<p>

Moreover, the Streamium family of products, depending on the media capabilities, allows a consumer to connect to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/52301.xml">
internet radio</link> stations and internet <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../728/1478728.xml">
photo sharing</link> (<web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Yahoo! Photos</link></web_site>
), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/853744.xml">
movie trailers</link> services directly. Subscriptions to web-based services  requiring subscriptions would be managed through the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://club.philips.com">
Club Philips portal</weblink> (see below).</p>
<p>

In all cases, using a computer with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../489/93489.xml">
RSS</link> receiver together with a UPnP AV MediaServer, it is possible to play back audio/video <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../453/1034453.xml">
podcast</link>. Some of the popular feeds include BBC live, Geekbrief, Reuters, Metacafe, YouTube. Although in most cases this video podcaster uses codec formats not supported by Streamium, it's still possible by using software codec transcoders on the PC to convert them to MPEG format.</p>
<p>

<link>
Philips Media Manager</link>, is--since SimpleCenter version 4-- a free open source UPnP AV MediaServer for Windows and Macintosh that is bundled with Streamium. Version 3 of <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/5066140.xml">

, was initially developed for inclusion with the Streamium line of products. Since Streamium devices also support photos and videos, SimpleCenter ships with video and image support, under the name 'Philips Media Manager' (PMM).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

History</st>
<p>

In 2000 Philips' consumer electronics division (business unit Audio) outlined an ambitious Internet strategy that was remarkably well executed initially: The Streamium brand was invented as well as a "Connected Home" vision. A sizeable number of products was announced, demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show (in Las Vegas, USA) and brought to market in the period between January 2000 and June 2003. In 2003 the "Connected Home" vision would be broadened to embrace the planet in the "Connected Planet" effort. This latest move was accompanied by an attempt to steer product development and industrialization from Eindhoven and to include other business units. Unfortunately, the "Connected Planet" withered, leaving a limited product portfolio of Streamiums.</p>

<p>

The FW-i1000, an audio mini-system including a CD-changer and AM/FM radio, and considered to be the precursor to the Streamium product line, first shipped in June 2001. It had been in development by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../550/23550.xml">

' audio business group in Sunnyvale (CA, USA) since May 2000. At the January 2001 <convention wordnetid="108309086" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/273555.xml">
Consumer Electronics Show</link></convention>
 they announced and demonstrated the first integrated audio device connecting to "over a thousand internet radio stations".</p>
<p>

The FW-i1000 was rapidly followed by a slew of other IP-enabled devices. The marketing name "Streamium" and the slogan "Don't dream  it, stream-it" was coined and globally registered by Ramon de la Fuente (now at Sonos) who replaced Tony Cher as a product manager in 2001.</p>

Both the Streamium-TV and MX6000i where capable of offering video content hosted by a web-based service. 
In fact, over the last 5 years (since ~2003), more than 50 companies have introduced home-network-ready receivers that connect your computer with your TV and audio system so you can stream music, TV shows, movies, and photos from the home office to your home theater.</p>
<p>

Later the SL50i multi-media adaptor and the SLM5500 media center were also introduced. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">
As of 2007</link> the WAS3300, WAC3300 and SLM5520 are some of the latest Streamium devices available from Philips.</p>

Architecture</st>
<p>

Whereas the FW-i1000 used the iM-networks service (then known as "SonicBox"), the end-to-end "Streamium" system designed by Daniel Meirsman, included a Philips owned back-end service (the "ECD-interface").</p>
<p>

This back-end service allowed Streamium devices to connect to "any number" of web based content delivery services. The back-end would thereby function as a "switch-board" connecting the content delivery services with individual boxes. Moreover, the back-end service would allow Philips to build out an "after-sales" relationship with their customers through the web-based [UI]-extension and would stimulate some early form of web-based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social networking</link> with the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.streamiumcafe.com">
streamium cafe</weblink> web site that was set up by Mark Tuttle.</p>
<p>

A navigation tree would be served to the Streamium-device from the Philips back-end, whereas the content itself would be directly streamed from the service to the Streamium-box subject to the site's policy (subject to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../143/1711143.xml">
compulsory licence</link>s...). By manipulating the navigation tree from the front panel of the Streamium-device users could select desired the service, genre, artist, album, track...</p>
<p>

From the start, Streamium-devices contained provisions (i.e. an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../938/56938.xml">
IEEE</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/20668.xml">
EUI-64</link> containing an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/3880649.xml">
OUI</link> and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/20668.xml">
MAC-address</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/10294.xml">

mechanisms</link>, as well as allowing downloading of <link>
software upgrades</link> (for bug-fixes as well as enabling new features).</p>
<p>

In most cases. Streamium functionality was provided by a module (a [PCB]) based on an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/8230363.xml">

<p>

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/45249.xml">
user interface</link> extension was available on the Streamium web-site (my.philips.com) that would allow users to manage their preferences, services and devices.</p>
<p>

On the <link>
frontpanel</link> or through the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../721/1306721.xml">
on-screen display</link> (OSD) of the Streamium devices, users could mark their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/5826555.xml">
favorites</link> or indicate they wanted to learn more about the song being played. The service would then send either an e-mail with more details, or post this info on my.philips.com with a click-through link (i.e. to Amazon.com for purchasing).</p>

There was no need to first download files to PC, or even to turn the PC on, to stream multimedia Internet content. (A broadband Internet connection is required.)</p>
<p>

A wide array of Yahoo! services including on-demand music videos, movie trailers and clips and photo services was launched together with the Streamium range extension in Spring 2004.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Out of the box consumers would have access to free services. Additionally, a number of services would offer premium (subscription-based) online services allowing consumers to broaden and personalize their home entertainment experience<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>.</p>

An early Web2.0 device?</st>
<p>

In his press conference during the CES2001, Guy Demuynck, then CEO of Philips CE, expressed his vision that the Internet would become as ubiquitous and accessible as the electric grid to devices other than the PC, and that people would increasingly rely on the Internet for information and entertainment<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>.</p>
<p>

"The Internet has transformed the way we do business," Demuynck stated, referring not only to communications and promotions but to product design as well. "We intend to put Internet capabilities into many products, making Internet content as accessible as pressing a single button on a TV remote. The Internet dominates all our thinking—it will expand from a browsing activity to an always-on, integral part of daily life," he said.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Innovative</st>
<p>

What made the early Internet audio and Streamium devices stand apart from the rest was the fact that Philips provided a back-end service, essentially aggregating an interesting services offering to its users. In addition, a UI extension was offered (my.philips) that allowed consumers to manage their devices, external service subscriptions, favorites, as well as to add their own streams. 
The PC-based UI extension was part of the lean-forward/lean-backward approach to this potentially complicated product range:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Lean backward functionality was accessible on the device directly</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Lean forward functionality was relegated to the PC</entry>
</list>

In essence, the Philips service offering was a walled garden; but the fact that consumers could add and access their own favorite streams made it more of an open system.
Although never published, Streamium relied on an XML-based API --not unlike the APIs we see today published by Web-service providers (YouTube, eBay,...) -- and implemented XML-based APIs as offered by its service providers.</p>

Commercial impact</st>
<p>

Unfortunately the first Streamium generations lacked support for a number of important media formats such as those included in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/441206.xml">
Windows Media</link> technologies which hampered their commercial success. 
Philips' legal team had issues with the non-assertion clause<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> that Microsoft required potential licensees to sign without prior opportunity to check the IP involved. Since Philips did and still does own a substantial patent-portfolio<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>, product management was not allowed to risk signing away rights on a substantial number of important patents.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>

Consumer testing</st>
<p>

To some extent consumers were involved in some of the design of the Streamiums. Of course, the classical focus test groups were used to find out what features consumers would deem important. But also after the official announcement, a limited number of pre-production versions of the Streamiums would be made available to a limited number of volunteer beta-testers that could sign up via a Philips web-site.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
