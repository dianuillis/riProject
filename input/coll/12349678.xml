The <b>Stuart Oil Shale Project</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/45010.xml">
oil shale</link> development project in Australia near <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. It was Australia's first major attempt since the 1950s to restart commercial use of oil shale.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> The project was originally developed by Australian companies <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/18953098.xml">
Southern Pacific Petroleum NL</link> and Central Pacific Minerals NL (SPP/CPM).

In 1997 SPP/CPM signed a joint venture agreement with the Canadian company <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../529/1724529.xml">
Suncor Energy</link></company>
 to develop the Stuart oil shale deposit.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  Suncor was designated as the project operator. In April 2001, Suncor left the project and SPP/CPM became the sole shareholder of the project. In February 2002, due the restructuring of SPP/CPM, SPP became the holding company for the group’s interests, including the Stuart Oil Shale Project. As SPP had granted fixed and floating charges in favour of Sandco Koala LLC in May 2003, the chargee appointed receivers of SPP on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/8356.xml">

2008</link>, Queensland Energy Resources announced that it has shunned the Alberta-Taciuk Processor (ATP) oil shale processing technology in favor of the Paraho II technology and that the ATP technology-based pilot plant is being dismantled, and obsolete components are being sold.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

The first stage of the project, which cost AU$250-360 million, consisted of an oil-shale mine and pilot <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../977/12321977.xml">
retorting plant</link>, which was constructed in 1997-1999.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> The plant, which was in operation from 1999 to 2004, used the ATP retorting technology being the first application of the ATP technology in the world on oil shale.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> The plant was designed to process 6,000 tonnes of oil shale per day with oil output of 4,500&nbsp;barrels (720&nbsp;m3).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> From 2000 to 2004 the pilot plant produced over 1.5&nbsp;million barrels (240,000&nbsp;m3) of oil. After the closure the facility is kept on care-and-maintenance in an operable condition.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> </p>
<p>

The second stage with cost of AU$600 million was planned to consist of a single commercial-size module four times larger than the first with total capacity of 19,000&nbsp;barrels (3,000&nbsp;m3) of oil products (naphtha and medium shale oil) daily. Originally it was planned to become operational in 2006. The third planned stage was construction of multiple commercial production units with capacity of up to 200 000 barrels of oil products per day.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  It was envisaged to come on stream during 2010–2013. The environmental impact assessment of stage 2 was suspended in December 2004.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

Controversy</st>
<p>

The project was heavily criticized by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/1866009.xml">
environmentalists</link>. Over 20,000 people and 27 environment, tourism and fishing groups opposed the shale oil plant.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../233/12233.xml">
Greenpeace</link> claimed that greenhouse emissions from the production of shale oil are nearly four times higher than from the production of conventional oil, although SPP promised to reduce greenhouse emissions from production of shale oil to 5% below those of conventional oil by stage 3. Greenpeace also claimed that the Stuart Oil Shale Project is a significant source of highly toxic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../142/13932142.xml">
dioxin</link>s and would damage the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area during stage 3. Also public health concerns were mentioned.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
