<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/15402.xml">
International standard</link>'s objective is to provide a mechanism that is capable of describing product data throughout the life cycle of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../436/285436.xml">
product</link>, independent from any particular system. The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving.</p>

 History </st>
<p>

The evolution of STEP can be divided into three release phases. The development of STEP started in 1984 as a successor of <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

</message>
. In 1994/95 ISO published the initial release of STEP as international standards (IS) with the parts 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 101, AP201, AP203. Today AP203  <cite >Configuration controlled 3D design</cite> is still one of the most important parts of STEP and supported by many CAD systems for import and export. </p>
<p>

In the second phase the capabilities of STEP got widely extended, primarily for the design of products in the aerospace, automotive, electrical, electronic, and other industries. This phase ended in the year 2002 with the second major release, including the STEP parts AP202, 209, AP210, AP212, AP214, AP224, AP225, AP227, AP232. Basic harmonization between the APs especially in the geometric areas was achieved by introducing the Application Interpreted Constructs (AIC, 500 series).</p>
<p>

A major problem with the APs of the first and second release is that they are too big, have too much overlap with each other and are not sufficiently harmonized. These deficits lead to the development of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../380/2247380.xml">
STEP modular architecture</link> (400 and 1000 series). This activity was primarily driven by new AP covering additional life-cycle phases such as early requirement analysis (AP233) and maintenance and repair (AP239), and also new industrial areas (AP221, 236). In addition older APs prepare for a new edition on a modular basis (AP203, 209, 210). This is an ongoing process.</p>

In total STEP consists of several hundred parts and every year new parts are added or new revisions of older parts are released. This makes STEP the biggest standard within ISO.
Each part has its own scope and introduction</p>
<p>

The APs are the top parts. They cover a particular application and industry domain and hence are most relevant for users of STEP. Every AP defines one or several Conformance Classes, suitable for a particular kind of product or data exchange scenario. To provide a better understanding of the scope, information requirements and usage scenarios an informative application activity model (AAM) is added to every AP, using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../538/2361538.xml">
IDEF0</link></p>
<p>

STEP is primarily defining data models using the EXPRESS modeling language. Application data according to a given data model can be exchanged either by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/1269826.xml">
STEP-File</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/1790124.xml">
STEP-XML</link> or via shared database access using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../057/1719057.xml">
SDAI</link>. </p>
<p>

Every AP defines a top data models to be used for data exchange, called the <it>Application Integrated Model</it> (AIM) or in the case of a modular AP called <it>Module Integrated Models</it> (MIM). These integrated models are constructed by choosing generic objects defined in lower level data models (4x, 5x, 1xx, 5xx) and adding specializations needed for the particular application domain of the AP. The common generic data models are the basis for interoperability between APs for different kinds of industries and life cycle stages.</p>
<p>

In APs with several <it>Conformance Classes</it> the top data model is divided into subsets, one for each Conformance Class.
The requirements of a conformant STEP application are:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 implementation of either a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/81971.xml">
preprocessor</link> or a <link>
postprocessor</link> or both, </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 using one of the STEP implementation methods STEP-File, STEP-XML or SDAI for the AIM/MIM data model and</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 supporting one or several conformance classes of an AP.</entry>
</list>

Originally every APs was required to have a companion <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../122/2951122.xml">
Abstract test suite</link> (ATS) (e.g. ATS303 for AP203), providing <link>
Test Purposes</link>, <link>
Verdict Criteria</link> and <link>
Abstract Test Cases</link> together with example STEP-Files. But because the development of an ATS was very expensive and inefficient this requirement was dropped and replaced by the requirements to have an informal validation report and recommended practises how to use it. Today the recommended practises are a primary source for those going to implement STEP.</p>
<p>

The <it>Application Reference Models</it> (ARM) is the mediator between the AAM and the AIM/MIM. Originally its purpose was only to document high level application objects and the basic relations between them. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../013/3180013.xml">
IDEF1X</link> diagrams documented the AP of early APs in an informal way. The ARM objects, their attributes and relations are mapped to the AIM so that it is possible to implement an AP. As APs got more and more complex formal methods were needed to document the ARM and so EXPRESS which was originally only developed for the AIM was also used for the ARM. Over time these ARM models got very detailed till to the point that some implementations preferred to use the ARM instead of the formally required AIM/MIM. Today a few APs have ARM based exchange formats standardized outside of ISO TC184/SC4:

There is a bigger overlap between APs because they often need to refer to the same kind of products, product structures, geometry and more. And because APs are developed by different groups of people it was always an issue to ensure interoperability between APs on a higher level. The <it>Application integrated constructs</it> (AIC) solved this problem for common specializations of generic concepts, primarily in the geometric area. To address the problem of harmonizing the ARM models and their mapping to the AIM the <it>STEP modules</it> were introduced. They contain a piece of the ARM, the mapping and a piece of the AIM, called MIM. Modules are built on each other, resulting in an (almost) directed graph with the AP and conformance class modules at the very top. The modular APs are:

The AP 221 model is very similar to the ISO 15926-2 model, whereas AP221 follows the STEP architecture and ISO 15926-2 has a different architecture. They both use ISO-15926-4 as their common reference data library or dictionary of standard instances. A further development of both standards resulted in <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../331/6112331.xml">
Gellish English</link></language>
 as general product modeling language that is application domain independent and that is proposed as a work item (NWI) for a new standard.</p>
<p>

The original intend of STEP was to publish one integrated data-model for all live cycle aspects. But due to the complexity, different groups of developers and different speed in the development processes, the splitting into several APs was needed. But this splitting made it difficult to ensure that APs are interoperable in overlapping areas. Main areas of harmonization are:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 AP214 and 203 in the area of 3D mechanical design. AP214 took over all of the functionality of the earlier AP203 edition and then extending the capabilities significantly. Now in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">
2007</link> the second edition of AP203 takes over bigger parts of AP214 by adding again new functionality.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 AP201, 202, 212, 214, 221 and now AP203ed2 for technical drawings with extension in AP212 and 221 for schematic functionality</entry>

</list>
</p>
<p>

For complex areas it is clear that more than one APs are needed to cover all major aspects:

 Future of STEP </st>
<p>

Despite the many successes of STEP there is still a question in user's minds about the speed of its development and deployment [5]. Many critics point out correctly that the XML standards for e-commerce are being developed much more quickly. To match with these mappings from STEP data models into XML on the basis of <standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">
<system_of_measurement wordnetid="113577171" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../537/8537.xml">
 DTD</link></system_of_measurement>
</standard>
 and later <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/185449.xml">
 XML-Schema</link></format>
 were defined. </p>
<p>

Another rather new approach is to use the <work wordnetid="100575741" confidence="0.8">
<event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">
<service wordnetid="100577525" confidence="0.8">
<act wordnetid="100030358" confidence="0.8">
<psychological_feature wordnetid="100023100" confidence="0.8">
<activity wordnetid="100407535" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../123/29123.xml">
Semantic Web</link></activity>
</psychological_feature>
</act>
</service>
</event>
</work>
 based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../001/248001.xml">
Web Ontology Language</link> for exchanging product information.</p>
<p>

Fundamentally, product model data is different from other kinds of e-commerce data such as invoices, receipts, etc. The traditional method for communicating product model information is to make a drawing and the traditional method to communicate an invoice is to make a form. When you make a drawing or 3D model you need to define information with many subtle and complex relationships and this makes the STEP data exchange problem more difficult.</p>
