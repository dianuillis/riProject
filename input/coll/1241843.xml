<b>Lydia Huntley Sigourney</b> <it>née</it> <b>Lydia Howard Huntley</b> (September 1, 1791 - June 10, 1865) was an extremely popular American poet during the early and mid 19th century.  She was commonly known as the "Sweet Singer of <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

."  Most of her works were published with just her married name <b>Mrs. Sigourney</b>.

Biography</st>

<ss1>
<st>
Early life</st>
<p>

Mrs. Sigourney was born in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/256970.xml">
Norwich, Connecticut</link></village>
 to Ezekiel Huntley and Zerviah Wentworth. Their only child, she was named after her father's first wife, Lydia Howard, who had died soon after marrying Ezekiel.</p>
<p>

In her autobiography <it>Letters of Life</it> Sigourney describes her relation to her parents, her decision to care for them, and her intent to avoid marriage because it would interfere with this relationship.</p>
<p>

I had . . . reason for avoiding serious advances. My mind was made up never to leave my parents. I felt that their absorbing love could never be repaid be the longest life-service, and that the responsibility of an only child, their sole prop and solace, would be strictly regarded by Him who readeth the heart. I had seen aged people surrounded by indifferent persons, who considered their care a burden, and could not endure the thought that my tender parents, who were without near relatives, should be thrown upon the fluctuating kindness of hirelings and strangers. To me, my father already seemed aged, though scarcely sixty; and I said, in my musing hours, Shall he, who never denied me aught, or spoke to me otherwise than in love-tones, stretch forth his hands in their weakness, "and find none to gird him"? (241). </p>

Education and the school for young ladies</st>

She was educated in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Hartford</link></village>
. After conducting a private school for young ladies in Norwich, she conducted a similar school in Hartford from 1814 until 1819.</p>
<p>

When she was quite young, one of her neighbors, the Widow Lathrop, was friendly with her and encouraged her to develop. After her friend Madam Lathrop died, Lydia was sent to visit Mrs. Jeremiah Wadsworth, an acquaintance of the Widow Lathrop in [Hartford, Connecticut]. This visit put her in contact with <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

Daniel helped her set up a school for girls, arranging for daughters of his friends to attend.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> In 1815, he also helped her publish her first work, <it>Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse</it>, arranging the publishing and performing the initial editing himself. Sigourney described Wadsworth as her "kind <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/504974.xml">
patron</link>" and says that he "took upon himself the whole responsibility of contracting publishers, gathering subscriptions, and even correcting the proof sheets".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> She goes on to say that "He delighted in drawing a solitary mind from obscurity into a freer atmosphere and brighter sunbeam".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

Marriage and married life</st>
<p>

On June 16, 1819, she married Charles Sigourney, and after her marriage chose to write anonymously in "leisure" time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> It was not until her parents were in dire need and her husband had lost some of his former affluence that she began to write as an occupation.

Since her death, her writings largely have been forgotten. When remembered, she has been criticized for being shallow or for catering to the society in which she lived where women were expected to avoid public lives. For example, much of her writing is referred to as "hack work" by Haight, her only biographer. Others have attributed her influence to her relationships with wealthy, powerful people of her day or to good business sense. Kolker points out that much of the criticism has come from modern ideas of finding a personal voice through poetry while Sigourney's avowed intent was to benefit others (66). This purpose would mean that she had no need to find a personal voice.</p>
<p>

"She was one of the most popular writers of her day, both in America and in England, and was called 'the American <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/165363.xml">
Hemans</link>.' Her writings were characterized by fluency, grace and quiet reflection on nature, domestic and religious life, and philanthropic questions; but they were too often sentimental, didactic and commonplace to have much literary value. Some of her blank verse and pictures of nature suggest <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

. Among her most successful poems are <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.niagarapoetry.ca/Contents.html#sigourney">
'Niagara'</weblink> and 'Indian Names.' Throughout her life she took an active interest in philanthropic and educational work" (<link>
1911 Encyclopædia Britannica</link>).</p>
<p>

Her influence was tremendous. She inspired many young women to attempt to become poets. According to Teed:</p>
<p>

As a dedicated, successful writer, Lydia Sigourney violated essential elements of the very gender roles she celebrated. In the process, she offered young, aspiring women writers around the country an example of the possibilities of achieving both fame and economic reward (19).</p>
<p>

Rev. E. B. Huntington wrote a small consideration of Mrs. Sigourney's life shortly after her death. He thought that her success came "because with [her] gifts and [her] success, she had with singular kindliness of heart made her very life-work itself a constant source of blessing and joy to others. Her very goodness had made her great. Her genial goodwill had given her power. Her loving friendliness had made herself and her name everywhere a charm" (85). She wrote to inspire others and Huntingdon felt that she had been successful.</p>
<p>

She contributed more than two thousand articles to many (nearly 300) periodicals (<link>
1911 Encyclopædia Britannica</link>) and some 67 books.</p>
<p>

In 1844, <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../962/113962.xml">

Lyceum Movement</st>

<p>

Sigourney's commitment to education, writing, and charity was testimony to women’s possibilities for self-betterment and, no doubt, a role model for women. When Sigourney gave up her anonymity for good, she became the most widely known "authoress" and "poetess" in America. As a result, during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/3435037.xml">
lyceum movement</link> that flourished in the United States in the 19th century, women named literary societies and study clubs in her honor, including the following examples:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
