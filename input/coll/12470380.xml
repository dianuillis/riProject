 Early life </st>
<p>

Born and raised in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/20206.xml">
Manchester</link></village>
 by parents Russell and Kimberly West, Edgar developed a tendency for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../752/752.xml">
art</link> at a young age but was generally discouraged by his then elderly grandfather, Arthur West, who had been an officer with the <military_unit wordnetid="108198398" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../731/410731.xml">
Welsh Guards</link></military_unit>
. Edgar enjoyed a comfortable childhood due to the wealth of his parents and grandparents and thusly focused his effort in terms of academic subjects, elsewhere.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> </p>
<p>

Edgar's second love was supposedly <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

, a subject at which he excelled in. His mother Kimberly had been an English teacher before marriage and Edgar had shared this apparently inherited passion. However the course of Edgar's life would soon change after the death of his grandfather, Arthur, just as he was preparing to leave for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/19725260.xml">
university</link> to study <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../384/18973384.xml">
English literature</link>. Young West took this as a sign and had his courses switched; the death of his grandfather seemingly rekindled his love for the arts, of which he had been denied for the majority of his youth.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Following his education at Camberwell West joined <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../172/148172.xml">
PricewaterhouseCoopers</link></company>
 and worked in their tax consultation department, specialising in taxing and auditing high value goods such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/153169.xml">
statues</link>, paintings and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../026/87026.xml">
tapestries</link>. The position offered West invaluable experience working with exotic pieces of art and is said to have matured his outlook on the profession. It was this experience that West would take with him to further opportunities, and that he could pass on during his lectures in <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

West later moved to America to lecture at The Savannah and it was here that he first integrated his writing ability with his love for art. His repertoire includes writing for various local newspapers and art journals, and often led him to be asked to review or judge competitions. On returning to <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/9316.xml">
England</link></country>
 in August <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/34647.xml">
1998</link> West became a full-time freelance art critic and journalist; writing for art supplements in many major newspapers in the UK, West soon established himself within both circles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> </p>
<p>

It was in 2002 that West joined a film crew in the Islamic heartlands to help research works of art for the programme “Islamic Art: Paradise Found”.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> With presenter <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

, and the rest of the recording team, West completed a highly successful tour of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/19323.xml">
Middle-East</link> finding himself immersed in the culture and the art. West quickly adopted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/803.xml">
Arabic</link> as a second language to aid his studies.</p>

 had been postponed however, due to the outbreak of war in Iraq and increasing tensions within the region.  It is believed that contacts West had made within <party wordnetid="108256968" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 would also be the cause of a follow-up program by Januszczak to be abandoned during January <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> </p>
<p>

During this time West had been informally dubbed “The Last Art Critic in the East” as his  writings on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../917/6037917.xml">
Islamic</link> arts for Western art journals became more widely regarded. Many of these articles offered a cynical view of the conflict, stating that bitter violence in the Middle-East was destroying some of these war torn countries finest treasures. Naturally many puns emerged surrounding his name (West), and his passionate interest in the East. </p>

He returned sporadically during <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/35984.xml">
