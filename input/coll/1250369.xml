The <b>monkey and banana problem</b> is a famous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/1331806.xml">
toy problem</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link>, particularly in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/17927_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
logic programming</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/1505641.xml">

Formulation of the problem</st>
<p>

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/3069677.xml">
monkey</link> is in a room. Suspended from the ceiling is a bunch of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/38940.xml">
banana</link>s, beyond the monkey's reach. In the corner of the room is a box. How can the monkey get the bananas?</p>
<p>

The solution is that the monkey must push the box under the bananas, then stand on the box, and then grab the bananas. However, figuring this out requires a <link>
planning</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>.</p>
<p>

In other variants of the problem, the bananas are in a chest and the monkey first has to open the chest using a key.</p>

Purpose of the problem</st>
<p>

There are many applications of this problem. One is as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/1331806.xml">
toy problem</link> for computer science.</p>
<p>

Another possible purpose of the problem is to raise the question: Are monkeys <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../280/519280.xml">
intelligent</link>? Both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/682482.xml">
human</link>s and monkeys have the ability to use mental <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../877/19877.xml">
map</link>s to remember things like where to go to find shelter, or how to avoid danger. They can also remember where to go to gather <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/10646.xml">
food</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>, as well as how to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/5177.xml">
communicate</link> with each other. Monkeys have the ability not only to remember how to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../791/38791.xml">
hunt</link> and gather but to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/183403.xml">
learn</link> new things, as is the case with the monkey and the bananas: despite the fact that the monkey may never have been in an identical situation, with the same artifacts at hand, a monkey is capable of concluding that it needs to move the box across the floor, position it below the bananas, and climb the box to reach for them. </p>
<p>

The degree to which such abilities should be ascribed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/288316.xml">
instinct</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/183403.xml">
learning</link> is a matter of debate.</p>
