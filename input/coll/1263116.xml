The <b>Project On Government Oversight</b> (<b>POGO</b>), founded in 1981 by Dina Rasor as the <b>Project on Military Procurement</b>,  is an independent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/72487.xml">
non-profit organization</link> in the United States that investigates and exposes corruption and other misconduct to achieve a more honest, open, and accountable federal government.  POGO investigates <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/5105530.xml">
federal agencies</link>, <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
Congress</link></legislature>
, and government contractors.  More than 20 years ago, POGO made its mark by uncovering <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/39583.xml">

 waste, fraud, and abuse by bringing to light the infamous $640 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/411727.xml">
toilet seat</link>s, $7,600 coffee makers, $436 hammers and other overpriced spare parts used by the military. POGO is currently led by executive director Danielle Brian.</p>
<p>

POGO’s range of investigations has expanded to include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/215337.xml">
national defense</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../105/42105.xml">
homeland security</link>; abuse in government contracting; excessive secrecy that fails to consider the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/173155.xml">
public good</link>; and mismanagement of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/21675.xml">
natural resources</link> by federal agencies. POGO uses <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/309754.xml">
investigative journalism</link> techniques to shed light on the government's activities, including working with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/33821.xml">
whistleblower</link>s and anonymous sources and accessing information through the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../152/163152.xml">
Freedom of Information Act</link> (FOIA).  POGO’s <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.contractormisconduct.org">
Federal Contractor Misconduct Database</weblink> has become an important tool for investigative journalists and others who want to stay on top of this important issue. </p>
<p>

Corporate whistleblowers and government insiders bring POGO many of its investigative topics. POGO informs the public of its findings, in large part through reports that contain extensive documentation and recommendations for how to solve the problems identified. Once a report has been released, many more insiders usually approach POGO to provide further documentation and information.  By gathering information and building relationships with whistleblowers and government insiders (at the congressional and agency levels), as well as by collaborating with other non-profit organizations, POGO is able to get to the root of the issues in question. We can then provide realistic recommendations for solving age-old problems that have plagued the government and the services it is responsible for providing. </p>
<p>

By applying internal and external pressure through the media, the public, government insiders, and policymakers, POGO helps ensure that the federal government implements policies and programs in a manner that benefits all Americans.</p>

The federal government has so far appropriated approximately $120 billion to respond to the relief, recovery, and reconstruction needs of the hurricane victims.  POGO has identified several systemic failures in, and evaporating oversight controls of, the federal contracting process and recommends that government contracting laws and regulations need to be strengthened because of:

, the aircraft’s manufacturer is able to secure MYP status, it would essentially lock the government into buying the 60 additional troubled F-22A’s and minimize the possibility that the program could suffer further funding cuts. An MYP would also result in the American taxpayers paying Lockheed $1 billion more than they would under the normal annual procurement process.</p>

<it>Summary</it>: There is no reason for the U.S. government to avoid competition for ownership and operation of wastewater treatment plants, whether they are located in the U.S.or in other countries.  However, Bajagua Project, LLC, has effectively utilized the standard avenues of influence – campaign contributions, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/1005883.xml">
revolving door</link>, and lobbying – to apply pressure on the company’s behalf. As a result, a number of Members of Congress designed legislation to deliver a sole-source contract for the construction and operation of a wastewater treatment facility in <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

/Bush era laws. POGO's research found that, since 1990, 43 of the government's top contractors paid approximately $3.4 billion in fines/penalties, restitution, and settlements. Furthermore, four of the top 10 government contractors have at least two criminal convictions. And yet, only one of the top 43 contractors has been suspended or debarred from doing business with the government, and then, for only five days.

Most of the reforms they sought, however, unraveled useful taxpayer protections created during the infamous defense contractor scandals of the 1980s.

When the database for the candidate reports is compared with the database for the PAC reports, only six incumbent candidates match – in the entire Congress. Furthermore, FEC’s two websites are neither linked nor concurrently updated. Among the inherent problems, a PAC will often be known by different names because the FEC does not require a standardized method to identify a PAC. Additionally, confusing forms have contributed to the dissemination of incorrect information. The Senate is further complicating the availability of information because it still hand files written reports. This report identifies seven sources of misinformation in the FEC's data and recommends specific reforms that must be addressed in order for more broad-reaching <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../302/339302.xml">

Defense Waste &amp; Fraud Camouflaged As Reinventing Government</weblink></p>
<p>

<it>Summary</it>: Overpriced spare parts horror stories from the 1980s taught us how to prevent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/58790.xml">
fraud</link>, and led to useful reforms.  By the 1990s, however, defense industry interests dovetailed with Vice President Gore's Reinventing Government campaign, and new policies bypassed some of the earlier reforms.  In the name of adopting "commercial" practices, the Administration's defense Acquisition Reform effort has gone beyond cutting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/467982.xml">
red tape</link> into throwing out important protections against contractor abuse that are needed even in a more commercial environment.  For example, a new greatly expanded definition for a "commercial" product has exempted many more purchases from normal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/3118654.xml">

<it>Summary</it>: POGO's investigation found that the military has been aware of serious wiring problems on its aircraft since at least the early 1980s, but failed to notify regulators. Furthermore, POGO discovered that wiring experts who tried to blow the whistle on flammable wiring problems were silenced and retaliated against over many years.  The military's actions left millions of commercial air travelers vulnerable to this deadly problem.</p>

crude oil</link> since 1980", we have finally received what they claim to be the last of the documents.  During this period, the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) has received thousands of pages of documents through the FOIA, and we have issued three previous reports on the topic. It comes as no surprise that it took so long for these final documents to be released. They paint a picture of an agency violating the public trust and working hard to keep the truth from the public and Congress.  As part of a larger effort to cover up the Agency's relationship with the oil industry, DOI knowingly entered into deals that forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars owed to the public. This revelation comes after the DOI acknowledged recently that the major oil companies do, in fact, owe the federal treasury significant amounts of money from underpaid royalties on crude oil production from federal land -- a turnaround after decades of ignoring the problem.</p>
