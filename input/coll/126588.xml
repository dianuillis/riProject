A <b>gift economy</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../633/317633.xml">
social theory</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> in which goods and services are given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../355/174355.xml">
quid pro quo</link></it>. Typically, a gift economy occurs in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/19159508.xml">
culture</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../349/150349.xml">
subculture</link> that emphasizes social or intangible rewards for solidarity and generosity: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../864/16864.xml">

honor</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/189043.xml">
loyalty</link> or other forms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/1180710.xml">
gratitude</link>. In some cases, simultaneous or recurring giving serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within a community. This can be considered a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/44189.xml">
reciprocal altruism</link>. Sometimes there is an implicit expectation of the return of comparable goods or services, political support, or the gift being later passed on to a third party. However, in what is considered to be in the true spirit of gift economics, many times giving is done without any expectation of reciprocity.</p>
<p>

The concept of a gift economy stands in contrast to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../843/7843.xml">
planned economy</link> or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/48852.xml">
market</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../232/4232.xml">
barter economy</link>. In a planned economy, goods and services are distributed by explicit command and control rather than informal custom; in barter or market economies, an explicit <it>quid pro quo</it> — an exchange of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8983183.xml">
money</link> or some other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/48218.xml">
commodity</link> — is established before the transaction takes place. In practice, most human societies blend elements of all of these, in varying degrees.</p>

A gift economy is sometimes referred to as a "sharing economy," although many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/9223.xml">
economists</link> reserve the term "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/2041431.xml">
sharing</link>" for the use of a single resource by more than one consumer, such as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../535/910535.xml">
common</link>, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/182010.xml">
public library</link>, or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../907/956907.xml">
shared car</link>.  It is also sometimes referred to as a "gift culture."</p>
<p>

One of the possible benefits of a gift economy (which it has in common with some planned economies) is that it can provide for the needs of some who have no current means with which to reciprocate. For example, if some in a society are so poor as to have nothing material to barter and no goods or money to bring to market, they can still receive charity if sufficient resources exist. Similarly, in the vast majority of societies, parents support their children at least in early childhood (and, in some societies, into adolescence and adulthood) without any explicit negotiation of what is expected in exchange. </p>

Anarchists, particularly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../405/98405.xml">
anarcho-primitivists</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../865/17865.xml">
anarcho-communists</link>, believe that variations on a gift economy may be the key to breaking the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../274/1796274.xml">
cycle of poverty</link>. Therefore they often desire to refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists advocate a pure gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning. This view traces back at least to <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/51074.xml">

Hyde locates the origin of gift economies in the sharing of food, citing for example the <land wordnetid="109334396" confidence="0.8">

 protocol of referring to a gift in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/1059727.xml">
Kula</link> exchange as "some food we could not eat," when it is not food at all, but an armband or shell necklace made for the explicit purpose of passing as a gift.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/192626.xml">
potlatch</link> also originated as a "big feed."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> He argues that this led to a notion in many societies of the gift as something that must "perish." In the Kula ring, this Kula gift economy still exist up until this day. In the region, other other systems such as <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

Many societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into commodities or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/181293.xml">

 there is a strong custom that any gift that crosses subclan boundaries must be consumed, rather than invested.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> For example, an animal given as a gift must be eaten, not bred. </p>
<p>

However, as in the example of the Trobriand armbands and necklaces, this "perishing" may not consist of consumption as such, but of the gift moving on. In other societies, it is a matter of giving some other gift, either directly in return or to another party. To keep the gift and not give another in exchange, though, is reprehensible. "In folk tales," Hyde remarks, "the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

A true gift economy normally requires gift exchange to be more than simply a back-and-forth between two individuals. A <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

i tale tells of two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/244747.xml">
Brahmin</link> women who tried to fulfill their obligations for alms-giving simply by giving alms back and forth to one another.

<p>

This notion of expanding the circle can be seen in societies where hunters give animals to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/23707.xml">
priest</link>s, who <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/80329.xml">
sacrifice</link> a portion to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/39438.xml">

, gives no significant explicit reciprocation for donations of blood. Most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../846/43846.xml">
organ donation</link> systems give no compensation of any sort to the donor or their family; payment in this matter is often considered suspect, even criminal.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/3808169.xml">
Regiving</link> networks are becoming very common in on-line forums where people offer items to anyone who wants them.  A feature of these is that they explicitly prohibit any reward, financial or otherwise.  They generally operate at a local level using volunteers who act as moderators to help efficiently run the forums.</p>
<p>

Information is particularly suited to gift economics, as information can be copied and transmitted at practically no cost. It can be treated as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../118/584118.xml">
nonrival good</link>: when you share information, you do not deprive yourself of the information (although not releasing it in an existing market economy may provide means to profit).</p>
<p>

Traditional scientific research is an information gift economy. Scientists produce research papers and give them away through journals and conferences. Other scientists freely refer to such papers. All scientists can therefore benefit from the increased pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../466/6974466.xml">

 web-based collaborative encyclopedia is, in most of its operations, a thriving gift economy. Millions of articles are available on Wikipedia, and none of their innumerable authors and editors receives any material reward. Wikipedia has been constructed entirely out of gifts, and gives information freely. From time to time Wikipedia has engaged in fundraising activities, asking people to contribute funds toward operating expenses; these donated funds are gifts, albeit explicitly solicited ones. A tiny portion of Wikipedia's income comes from product sales, mostly T-shirts, mugs, and the like, with Wikipedia logos. Because Wikipedia exists within a money economy, some expenses must be met with money, such as paying for servers, domain registration, and for certain IT work involved in server maintenance. Therefore, the information in Wikipedia is a gift economy, but some operational aspects of its website and related entities are not. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Small-scale gift economies also exist in most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/10401954.xml">
families</link>, with gifts of time, money, nourishment, shelter, and expertise being given without any overt negotiation of reciprocation.

Characteristics</st>
<p>

As remarked above, in a typical gift economy, gift recipients are expected to give something in return, such as political support, military services and general loyalty, or even return gifts and favors. This was common in warrior societies where <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../012/19012.xml">
kings</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/3512364.xml">
chieftain</link>s gave freely to their followers and could expect their loyal service in return. Such systems have social sanctions built in to punish freeloaders or miserly chiefs. A default punishment would be to halt gifts or services from one party to the alleged party in wrong. Typical sanctions might also include a bad reputation, formal eviction from the lord's hall, a challenge to a duel, or public ridicule. A stingy lord would find it difficult to attract followers.&#91;&#32; &ndash; &#93; </p>

 expresses the spirit of a gift economy (and its contrast to a market economy) as follows:</p>
<p>

The opposite of "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/583640.xml">
Indian giver</link>" would be something like "white man keeper"… [W]hatever we have been given is supposed to be given away not kept. Or, if it is kept, something of similar value should move in its stead… [T]he gift may be given back to its original donor, but this is not essential… The only essential is this: <it>the gift must always move.</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

He further remarks that a traditional gift economy is based on "the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../792/218792.xml">
obligation</link> to give, the obligation to accept, and the obligation to reciprocate," and that it is "at once economic, juridical, moral, aesthetic, religious, and mythological."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

Hyde argues, somewhat against Mauss, that there is a difference between a "true" gift given out of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/1180710.xml">
gratitude</link> and a "false" gift given only out of obligation. In Hyde's view, the "true" gift binds us in a way beyond any commodity transaction, but "we cannot really become bound to those who give us false gifts."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> Referring to <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

 &mdash; which functions internally largely as a gift economy &mdash; Hyde passes on a piece of AA jargon: a "Two-Stepper" is a person who tries to go directly from stopping drinking <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../014/1014.xml">
alcohol</link> to the twelfth step of giving back to others. That person has received a gift (sobriety) for which he or she feels an obligation; however, instead of doing the necessary labor (the next ten steps) to be in a position to fulfill the obligation, he or she attempts to give that which he or she does not yet possess.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref></p>
<p>

While it is easy to romanticize a gift economy, humans do not always wish to be enmeshed in a web of obligation. <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

The lack of such a "feeling bond" can, of course, be taken to hideous extremes, as when the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 neighborhood, tells in passing the story of two sisters who each came into a small inheritance. One sister hoarded the inheritance and prospered materially for some time, but was alienated from the community. Her marriage ultimately broke up, and she integrated herself back into the community largely by giving gifts. The other sister fulfilled the community's expectations, but within six weeks had nothing material to show for the inheritance but a coat and a pair of shoes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref></p>

The mixing of gift and commodity-based economies</st>
<p>

Hyde argues that when a primarily gift-based economy is turned into a commodity-based economy, "the social fabric of the group is invariably destroyed."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref> Much as there are prohibitions against turning gifts into capital, there are prohibitions against treating gift exchange as barter. Among the Trobrianders, for example, treating Kula as barter is considered a disgrace.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref> </p>
<p>

Commodity exchange bypasses the web of gratitude and obligation involved in gift-giving. It is possible, however, to reintroduce elements of a gift economy into commodity exchange, such as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../448/364448.xml">
lagniappe</link></it> given to a loyal customer, or a <link>
professional discount</link> given to a colleague.</p>
<p>

Less happily, elements of a gift economy may be viewed from the standpoint of contract law and commodity exchange as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../538/313538.xml">
nepotism</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/66220.xml">
corruption</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/260979.xml">
bribery</link>. Conversely, contract law based rational economic action aiming at profits may be viewed from the standpoint of a gift economy as unethical, amoral behavior.&#91;&#32; &ndash; &#93; </p>
<p>

Hyde writes that commercial goods can generally become gifts, but when gifts become commodities, the gift "…either stops being a gift or else abolishes the boundary… Contracts of the heart lie outside the law and the circle of gifts is narrowed, therefore, whenever such contracts are narrowed to legal relationships."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>
<p>

Even the most commodity-based economies have social (and/or legal) prohibitions on what may be commodified. In many societies, one may give up a child for adoption, but may not sell one's child. In most U.S. states, almost any private sexual activity between consenting adults is either legal or informally tolerated if it does not involve the exchange of money; most intimate acts move into the realm of the criminal if money is exchanged. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../846/43846.xml">
Organ donation</link> is actively encouraged; however, the sale of organs is not merely considered a crime, but is almost universally considered a particularly unsavory crime.&#91;&#32; &ndash; &#93;</p>

According to the critics the English word "gift" is usually a very poor translation of the wide variety of words actually used by hunter-gatherer and other cultures to describe their transactions and obligations. It is also a poor metaphor for describing the wide variety of such forms. The term "gift" was applied to "primitive cultures" by missionaries and colonial anthropologists who oversimplified their sophisticated and obscure transactions.  The term is also paternalistic, comparing sophisticated native transactions to the traditions of Western children, such as the Christmas gift exchange. This colonial legacy has been overlaid by a romantic yearning for the more innocent sounding transactions of our childhood, perpetuating the myth of a "gift economy" into post-colonial anthropology and ideology. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref></p>
<p>

On a more fundamental level, staunch advocates of a free-market economy and trading value-for-value criticize the notion of a gift economy as immoral, impractical, suboptimally productive, or all of these things.</p>

rational choice theorists</link> argue that alternatives to free market economies will provide weak incentives, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/48852.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Market+criticism+of+market+economic+alternatives%22])">
criticises such alternatives</link> because he does not believe there is any incentive for innovation or production as time progresses. With such weak incentives, they believe that very few goods or services will be produced for society compared to a market economy. They believe that without property arrangements, prices, and wages, there is no way to calculate individuals' needs and wants, and hoarding may result.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../030/1030.xml">
Austrian economists</link> argue that general prosperity in the modern economy depends on a highly elaborate and global division of knowledge and labor.  Non-local division of labor in turn requires a market price mechanism based on transactions between strangers who, beyond prices and some other simple contractual terms, are generally ignorant of each other's needs.   The "gift economy," on the other hand, depends on high degrees of reputation, trust, and mutual knowledge of those with whom one transacted.  It is necessarily thus limited to a network of friends and relatives, a group no larger than the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/2678638.xml">
Dunbar number</link>. According to their analysis, it would thus reduce the division of labor, and result in universal poverty in larger groups.</p>
<p>

Because such views generally do not attack the gift economy per se, but alternatives to free market economies in general, proponents of a pure gift economy advocate that other social mechanisms within a gift economy will replace the need for prices, which carry information about needs and wants. In this context, other individuals make the judgment which wants or needs is to be fulfilled first, in contrast to a market economy where goods would be allocated to the consumer offering the highest price. Those offering and giving the best products would then gain standing in the community.</p>
<p>

Kropotkin argues that mutual benefit is a stronger incentive than mutual strife and is eventually more effective collectively in the long run to drive individuals to produce. The reason given is that a gift economy stresses the concept of increasing the other's abilities and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/47155.xml">
means of production</link>, which would then (theoretically) increase the ability of the community to reciprocate to the giving individual. Other solutions to prevent inefficiency in a pure gift economy due to wastage of resources that were not allocated to the most pressing need or want stresses the use of several methods involving collective <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/91190.xml">
shunning</link> where collective groups keep track of other individuals' productivity, rather than leaving each individual having to keep track of the rest of society by him or herself.</p>
