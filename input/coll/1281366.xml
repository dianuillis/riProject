After WWII, things continued along much the same path until the early 1950s. Then a revolution, that was to forever change the nature of the submarine arm occurred. That revolution was <conveyance wordnetid="103100490" confidence="0.8">

The <it>Nautilus</it> was the first nuclear-powered submarine. Up until that point, submarines had really been, at their most basic level, torpedo boats that happened to be able to go underwater. They had been tied to the surface by the need to charge their batteries using diesel engines relatively often. The nuclear power plant of the <it>Nautilus</it> meant that the boat could stay underwater for literally months at a time, the only limit in the end being the amount of food that the boat could carry. With resupply by mini-subs, even this is not actually a final limit. The final limit, would be for replacing equipment that wears out and the fatigue limit of the hull.  <it>Nautilus</it> put to sea for the first time on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../920/15920.xml">

. Nuclear powered, like <it>Nautilus</it>, <it>George Washington</it> added strategic ballistic missiles to the mix. Earlier submarines had carried strategic missiles, but the boats had been diesel powered, and the missiles required the boat to surface in order to fire. The missiles were also cruise missiles, which were vulnerable to the defences of the day in a way that ballistic missiles were not.</p>
<p>

<it>George Washington's</it> missiles could be fired while the boat was submerged, meaning that it was far less likely to be detected before firing. The nuclear power of the boat also meant that, like <it>Nautilus</it>, <it>George Washington's</it> patrol length was only limited by the amount of food the boat could carry. <snack_food wordnetid="107712382" confidence="0.8">

Given the lack of large scale conventional naval warfare since 1945, with the USN's role being primarily that of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../158/931158.xml">
power projection</link>, the submarine service did not fire weapons in anger for very many years. The development of a new generation of cruise missiles changed that. The BGM-109 <link>
Tomahawk missile</link> was developed to give naval vessels a long range land attack capability. Other than direct shore bombardment, and strikes by aircraft flying off carriers, the ability of naval vessels to influence warfare on land was limited.</p>
<p>

Now, instead of being limited to firing shells less than 20 miles inland from guns, any naval vessel fitted with the Tomahawk could hit targets up to 1,000 miles inland. The mainstay of the Tomahawk equipped vessels in the early days of the missile's deployment were the <overview wordnetid="106469223" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<image wordnetid="105928118" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, and the submarine fleet. The Tomahawk was first used in combat on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../920/15920.xml">
17 January</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../703/34703.xml">
1991</link>, on the opening night of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../000/182000.xml">
Operation Desert Storm</link>. On that day, for the first time since the surrender of Japan in 1945, an American submarine fired in combat, when Tomahawks were launched by U.S. boats in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>

Since then, the Tomahawk has become a staple of American campaigns. It has seen use in no less than three separate wars. It has also been exported to the United Kingdom, which has also fitted it to submarines. The Tomahawk has seen a change in the design of attack submarines. At first it was fired through torpedo tubes, but more recent U.S. boats have been fitted with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../703/666703.xml">
vertical launch system</link>s to enable them to carry more of the weapons.</p>
<p>

In the early 21st century, the USN submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear powered vessels. It is the most powerful of its type in the world. However, there are those who worry that there are not enough boats in the fleet. As with other branches of the U.S. military the budget cuts of the late 1980s and the early 1990s, as the Cold War ended, followed up by the <conflict wordnetid="100958896" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../800/13425800.xml">

, have left little or no slack in the system. This point is illustrated by the fact that in 2003, for the first time since 1945, an American submarine made two back-to-back war patrols.</p>

<p>

U.S. Navy submarines are manned solely by volunteers from within the Navy. Submarine personnel are accepted only after the most rigorous testing and observation.</p>
<p>

Some 5,000 officers and 55,000 enlisted people make up the submarine force. In addition to submarines, they are assigned to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/476558.xml">
submarine tender</link>s, submarine rescue ships, deep-diving submersibles, floating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/213739.xml">
dry dock</link>s, shore support facilities, submarine staffs, and senior command staffs.</p>
<p>

The submarine force has always been a small fraction of the active Navy. In 1998 only about seven percent of the Navy's people were submariners, though they operated one-third of the Navy's warships.</p>
<p>

Today, at the end of the decade, the smaller submarine force of the late 1990s continues to man a significant fraction of the Navy's warships, and some of the most capable and versatile.</p>

Besides their academic and technical training, much of which is Classified Secret or Top Secret, all prospective US Naval Submariners, both officers and enlisted personnel, undergo 3 phases of physical training and testing related to the intense pressure differential between the surface and submarine operating depth.  </p>
<p>

Of the following three trainings, only the escape training is currently in use:
</p>
<ss1>
<st>
 Valsalva maneuver </st>
<p>

The first test is for the ability to perform the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/311424.xml">
Valsalva maneuver</link>, named for <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

.  If a submarine training candidate cannot perform the Valsalva maneuver under doctor's supervision at normal atmospheric pressure, that candidate is rejected as <it>unfit for submarine service</it> but may serve on surface ships.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Pressure </st>
<p>

In the second phase of testing, called <it>Pressure Testing</it>, candidates who have successfully performed the Valsalva maneuver will be subjected to increased ambient pressure.  This test is performed under the supervision of a diving-certified medical doctor.  All testees enter a pressure chamber, accompanied by the doctor, and the 'tank' is sealed.  Typically, there is in the chamber a somewhat surprising object: an inflated volleyball, water polo ball or similar inflated ball.  Upon sealing the tank, pressure is increased, while the testees equalise their eardrum pressure.  (if any testee is unable to 'Valsalva', the test stops, and pressure is slowly released.)  Pressure builds within the chamber until the chamber is equal to water pressure at "escape depth".  At this point, the chamber feels very warm and dry, and the volleyball has become compressed enough that it has become the shape of a bowl, and appears to have been emptied of air, due to the greatly increased air pressure inside of the tank.  Sounds inside the tank at pressure sound as if they are "far away".</p>
<p>

During the controlled release of pressure from the tank, the air in the chamber becomes quite chilled  and a fog forms in the chamber, often precipitating as a sort of dew. (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/1419.xml">
adiabatic expansion</link>) Once pressure is fully released, the candidates are examined with an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../335/3083335.xml">
otoscope</link> to check for ruptured eardrums.  Candidates with ruptured eardrums are either rejected as unfit, or removed from the testing cycle until healed, depending on the severity of the injury.</p>

The third phase of testing for submarine fitness is escape training, utilizing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/470726.xml">
<it>Steinke hood submarine escape appliance''</it></link>, or colloquially known as the Steinke hood or, more familiarly, as "Stinky hood".  This is a very complex device, but essentially it covers the head and shoulders during ascent from a stranded submarine, allowing air to escape during ascent, which is necessary as the expanding air in the lungs would otherwise cause disastrous injury.</p>
<p>

The escape testing proceeds as in the pressure test, except that this time, a hatch in the floor of the pressure chamber is opened.  The chamber immediately adjoins a cylindrical tower full of water,  tall enough to simulate the depth of a stranded submarine.  Because the air pressure inside the chamber is equal to the pressure of the water in the tower, the water does not enter the chamber.</p>
<p>

Donning the Steinke hood, the testee, enters the water, and immediately commences a rapid ascent, due to the buoyancy of the escape device.  As they ascend, each testee must allow the air in his lungs to escape, this is facilitated by yelling as loudly as possible.  Typically they are told to yell "I feel fine!" repeatedly.  If one does not forcefully and continuously expel air from the lungs in this manner, they may be gravely injured or killed.  The air exiting the lungs is allowed to exit the hood through a set of two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../795/428795.xml">
one-way valve</link>s, keeping the device inflated but not over-inflated.</p>
<p>

Successfully completing the escape training requires two trials, one of them at <it>double the depth</it> of the first.  On completion of escape training, testees are now considered <it>bubbleheads</it>.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/304054.xml">
As of 2004</link>, the Steinke Hood is slated for replacement with the Mark 10 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/9976299.xml">
Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment</link> (SEIE) suit. The Mark 10 will allow submariners to escape from much deeper depths than currently possible with the Steinke Hood.  Some US Navy submarines already have the system, with an ambitious installation and training schedule in place for the remainder of the fleet.  </p>
<p>

The Mark 8, its predecessor, was a double layer suit which gave the wearer the appearance of a <link>
Michelin Man</link>.  One layer was eliminated, and the fabric was used to build a life <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/186229.xml">
raft</link> that would fit in the same package that the original suit came in. </p>
<p>

Because it is a full body suit, the Mark 10 provides thermal protection once the wearer reaches the surface, and the British <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

The Mark 10 Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment suit is slated to be in place aboard all US Navy submarines by 2007. The navies of twenty-two nations currently use SEIE units of some type.</p>

Construction Complete on Submarine Escape Trainer  11/06/2007</p>
<p>

[By Robert Howland, NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic Project Engineer]</p>
<p>

<p>

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), Mid-Atlantic has completed construction on a one-of-a-kind Submarine Escape Trainer at the Naval Submarine School in SUBASE New London, Conn.
At the core of the new $18 million facility is a 20-foot diameter, 40-foot high, 84,000-gallon pool atop escape trunks, called the Lock-out Trunk (LOT) and the Logistics Escape Trunk (LET), that simulate conditions a submariner would experience during an escape from a submerged submarine. Also within the four-story pool tower are diving support equipment, pool operation equipment, and two recompression chambers.
"A key component of the success of this project was the extensive involvement and assistance from the Naval Submarine School's N4 Engineering and High Risk Training Department during the entire project," said Robert Howland, the project engineer from NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic's New London Public Works Department. "They are the professionals who will use this facility and they know exactly what is needed to sufficiently train these sailors."
The pressurized training unit is intended to train for escape from a disabled submarine with current escape immersion equipment that is in the fleet. The facility is designed to be compatible with the Navy's Seawolf, Los Angeles, Trident and Virginia class submarines. The training facility will familiarize submariners with realistic escape procedures, marking a significant improvement over the unpressurized simulator currently in use.
The contract was awarded on Feb. 14, 2005, as a Design Build Contract to M. A. Mortenson Company of Minneapolis, Minn. and Kling Architecture &amp; Engineering of Philadelphia, Pa., as the Architecture and Engineer.
Mortenson completed construction in August 2007. Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center is now installing the LOT and LET trunks and relocating the existing recompression chamber and other government furnished equipment for the facility. The tank will be filled in July 2008 and the facility will become operational in December 2008.
Upon completion of the pool operating system testing, the N4 Engineering and High Risk Training Department staff has approximately four months for staff training and certification before the facility can send the first class of students through this Navy training course.</p>

 Insignia </st>
<p>

Further training and qualification at sea are required before submariners are awarded the coveted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/768008.xml">
Submarine Warfare Insignia</link> ("dolphins") - the submarine insignia worn by officers (gold) and enlisted personnel (silver) to demonstrate their achievement.</p>
<p>

The insignia of the U.S. Navy's Submarine Service is a Submarine flanked by two dolphins (the fish, not the mammal). </p>
<p>

Wearing the dolphins is a source of pride.  Upon reassignment to "Fleet service", and leaving the submarine service, both officers and enlisted personnel usually continue to wear them with pride.</p>
<p>

The origin of this insignia dates back to June 1923, when Captain <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../637/447637.xml">
Ernest King</link></person>
, USN, Commander, Submarine Division Three (later Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations), suggested to the Secretary of the Navy that a device for qualified submariners be adopted. He submitted a pen-and-ink sketch as an example.  A Philadelphia firm, Bailey, Banks and Biddle, was requested to design a suitable badge. In 1928, a member of that firm told Ensign William C. Eddy that they were looking for a design. Eddy, using sketches of the 1926 Naval Academy class crest that he had designed, came up with the present submarine insignia.</p>
<p>

In 1941 the Uniform Regulations were modified to permit officers and enlisted men to wear the submarine insignia after they had been assigned to other duties in the naval service, unless such right had been revoked. The officer insignia was a bronze gold plated metal pin, worn centered above the left breast pocket and above the ribbons or medals. Enlisted men wore an embroidered silk insignia on the outside of the right sleeve, midway between the wrist and elbow until 1947 when it was shifted to above the left breast pocket. In 1943 the Uniform Regulations were modified to allow enlisted men, who were qualified for submarine duty then subsequently promoted to commissioned or warrant ranks, to continue wearing the enlisted submarine insignia until they qualified as submarine officers when they were entitled to wear the officers submarine pin. A 1950 change to Uniform Regulations authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to pin-on insignia) and a bronze, silver plated, pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).</p>

 SSBN patrol pin </st>
<p>

Following the tradition of the <link>
World War II patrol pin</link>, the silver Polaris Patrol Pin is worn by SSBN crews both officer and enlisted. It recognizes their sacrifice and hard work in completing strategic patrols. One gold star marks each patrol completed. A silver star marks five patrols. Upon completion of 20 patrols, a gold patrol pin is authorized.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
 Neptune Award </st>
<p>

The person on active duty, officer or enlisted, with the most deterrent patrols is presented with the Neptune Award. That person retains the award until someone else attains more patrols than the current holder or until he retires and it goes to the member with the next highest number of patrols.</p>
<p>

MMCM(SS) "Bubba" Brooks was stationed aboard the USS Mariano G. Vallejo in 1984 when he received this prestigious award.  At that time, he was the ONLY submariner authorized to wear the Gold Patrol Pin.  Everyone else wore silver.</p>

Navy Hymn</link> were written by the Reverend Gale Williamson:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

Bless those who serve beneath the deep,
</indent>
:Through lonely hours their vigil keep.
<indent level="1">

May peace their mission ever be,
</indent>
:Protect each one we ask of thee.

Bless those at home who wait and pray,
