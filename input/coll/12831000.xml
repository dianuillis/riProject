Internet censorship is effected in Thailand by two methods. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/14338598.xml">
Royal Thai Police</link> blocks approximately 32 500 websites and the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../162/10015162.xml">

</company>
 a further unspecified number directly at Thailand's Internet gateway.</p>

MICT</link>)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> , blocks indirectly by informally “requesting” the blocking of websites by Thailand's 54 commercial and non-profit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
Internet Service Provider</link>s (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
ISPs</link>).  Although <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/28147.xml">
September 19</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">
2006</link>, the Thai military staged a bloodless coup d'état against the government of elected Prime Minister <chancellor wordnetid="109906986" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 on September 20, the first day following the coup, was to enforce Web censorship and appointing Dr. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/7968483.xml">
Sitthichai Pokaiudom</link> “The Official Censor of the Military Coup” as Minister of ICT.</p>

 History </st>
<p>

Prior to the military coup d'état, in September 2006, 34,411 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/33898.xml">
web sites</link> were blocked. The top cited reasons are: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../507/5710507.xml">
Pornography</link> 56%, sale of sex equipment 13%, and threats to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../468/240468.xml">
national security</link> 11%, which includes criticisms of the king, government or military.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  This figure represents blocking done by all three government agencies.</p>
<p>

In October 2006, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link> blocked 2475 websites by "request"; by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/15847.xml">
January 11</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">
2007</link>, this number had risen to 13,435 websites, a jump of more than 500%.  This brings the current total of websites blocked to more than 45,000. All websites are blocked in secret and the criteria for censorship has never been made public by government. However, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../697/221697.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Computing%22])">
blocklist</link> must be made available to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
ISP</link>s to block. </p>
<p>

Although the great majority of censored sites are pornographic, the list is liberally salted with an attempt to block all anonymous proxy servers which serve to circumvent Web-blocking and Internet gambling sites.  Pornography and gambling are specifically illegal in Thailand.</p>

</sec>

<st>
 Methods </st>
<p>

Websites are blocked by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/32277.xml">
Uniform Resource Locator</link> (URL) and/or <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">
<protocol wordnetid="106665108" confidence="0.8">
<direction wordnetid="106786629" confidence="0.8">
<rule wordnetid="106652242" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/15323.xml">
IP address</link></rule>
</direction>
</protocol>
</message>
. However, only about 20% of blocked sites are identified by IP; the remaining 80% are unable to be identified at a physical location. If these sites could be identified as being located in Thailand, legal action could be taken against their operators. Thus, lack of IP is a major oversight.</p>
<p>

Several technologies are employed to censor the Internet such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/78768.xml">
caching</link>, blacklisting domain name or IP address, or simply redirection to a government homepage. Blacklisting the website is beneficial for this kind of web censorship as the webmasters would be unaware that their websites are being blocked. This measure is said to be used to make unpleasant websites appear unavailable.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

Many censored web sites previously redirected the user to a site hosted by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
Ministry of Information and Communication Technology</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link>) which states that the requested destination could not be displayed due to improper content. It should also be noted that censorship of the Internet in Thailand is currently for website access only. Unlike <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../405/5405.xml">
China</link></country>
's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/154457.xml">
“Great Firewall”</link>, which censors all Internet traffic including chat conversation via <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/55951.xml">
Instant Messaging</link>, Thai Internet users are still able to interact with other users without being censored. However, current policy is to use a system of transparent proxies so that the user receives system, server, TCP and browser error messages when trying to access blocked sites leading the user to believe that the failure is caused in the Internet itself.</p>
<p>

Search engine giants, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/1092923.xml">
Google</link></company>
 and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/188213.xml">
Yahoo!</link></company>
, were approached to investigate the potential capability for blocking access to their cached web pages in Thailand, a common technique used to circumvent blocking. The search engines were also asked about blocking by keyword search which is used effectively in China to censor the Internet. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/1092923.xml">
Google</link></company>
, at least, has made public a statement that it has no intention of blocking any sites to users in Thailand.</p>
<p>

<link>
Wayback Engine</link>, a project of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/176931.xml">
Archive.org</link>, currently caches 85 billion inactive web pages.  Some of these are now being blocked by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link>. With 100 million active web pages, 10% of which are thought to be pornographic, the effect of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link>'s censorship will only be negligible. </p>
<p>

Another, more disturbing, trend is the censorship of anti-coup websites such as <politics wordnetid="113840719" confidence="0.8">
<social_relation wordnetid="100032823" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/7106501.xml">
19 September Network against Coup d'Etat</link></social_relation>
</politics>
, which has been blocked six times, as of Febreuary 2007, with government refusing to acknowledge responsibility for the blocking.  </p>
<p>

Internet webboards and discussion forums such as <link>
Midnight University</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> <link>
Prachatai.com</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> and <web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/5747758.xml">
Pantip.com</link></web_site>
 have all been blocked so reasonable political discussion has been rendered impossible. Prachatai and Pantip have chosen to self-censor, closely monitoring each discussion, in order to remain unblocked.  In addition, video sharing sites such as Camfrog have recently been blocked with the grounds given that people were "behaving indecently" on webcams; the block was later reversed when it was discovered that Camfrog provided a principal means of communication for the handicapped, elderly and shut-ins. Other video sharing sites such as Metacafe remain blocked however. The entire video upload website, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/3524766.xml">
YouTube</link></company>
, has suffered several blockings, including a complete ban between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/18951826.xml">
April 4</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">

August 31</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/36165.xml">
2007</link> due to a video which was considered to be offensive to the monarchy; YouTube's parent company, Google, was reported in the press to have agreed to assist the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link> in blocking individual videos rather than the entire website. The entire <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/3524766.xml">
YouTube</link></company>
 site block persisted for nearly five months, despite the fact that the video challenged by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/562155.xml">
MICT</link> was voluntary deleted by the user who posted it.</p>

Although the “interpretive biography” of Thailand's King Bhumibhol Adulyadej, <it>The King Never Smiles</it> by <link>
Paul Handley</link> (Yale University Press) was published in July 2006, websites concerning the book had been blocked as far back as November 2005. As no advance reading copies or excerpts were made available, these sites were censored based on the book's title alone.  All sites with links to sales of the book are still blocked, including Yale University Press, Amazon. com, Amazon UK and many others.</p>

Interference in communication, including the Internet, was specifically prohibited by Section 37 of the 1997 “People's” Constitution and free speech protected by Section 39.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> However, following the pattern of past coups, the military's first action was to scrap the Constitution and establish drafting a new one.
