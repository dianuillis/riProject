Amateur career</st>
<p>

After serving in the military (where he first played around with boxing in the gym) and working as a prison guard, Smith competed in a few amateur fights before turning professional in November 1981, at the late age of 28. </p>

<p>

He lost his first fight against <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">
<person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.8">
<boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.8">

James "Broad-Axe" Broad</link></causal_agent>

</boxer>
</person>
</physical_entity>
, a vastly experienced world class amateur and qualifier for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/82785.xml">
1980 Olympics</link> who was 2-0 as a pro. The fight was broadcast on <channel wordnetid="106259898" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../795/77795.xml">
ESPN</link></channel>
, and Smith had come in on short notice and was not in great shape, looking out of depth against the skilled Broad. Smith was dropped in 4 rounds with body shots, and counted out.</p>
<p>

The following year Smith upset future <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/1839240.xml">
cruiserweight</link> world champion and southpaw <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../714/11220714.xml">
Ricky Parkey</link>, then 2-0 as a pro, by winning a 6 round points decision. After scoring two knockouts, Smith followed up the Parkey win with another upset, an 8 round points decision over Chris McDonald, who was 8-0-1 as a pro and had been a top amateur. He went on to score nine straight knockouts, before traveling to the UK in 1984 to fight a world title eliminator against the hard hitting undefeated British prospect <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/325187.xml">
Frank Bruno</link></boxer>
, who was 21-0 (21 KO). Once again Bonecrusher would throw a spanner in the works. Having been outboxed with relative ease by Bruno for the first nine rounds, he unleashed a salvo of power punches to kayo Bruno in the tenth and final round, and qualified for a world title shot. The fight showed all his strengths and weaknesses - he couldn't box with the best, but had a decent chin and world class power in his right hand.</p>
<p>

In November 1984 he fought the long reigning <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/140927.xml">
Larry Holmes</link></boxer>
 for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/241038.xml">
IBF</link> heavyweight championship. Holmes had a record of 45-0 and had won eighteen straight world title fights. After rocking Holmes several times, a waning Smith was stopped on advice of the doctor in the 12th round, due to a bad cut. He again was vastly behind on points. </p>
<p>

Smith came back in 1985 relegated to fighting on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../527/14428527.xml">
Don King</link> undercards. He lost a 10 round decision to 19-0 amateur star and future world champ <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 (14-2) and <link>

<p>

In December 1986, while preparing for a fight with the erratic <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 informed him at short notice that Tony Tubbs had dropped out of his upcoming challenge to reigning WBA champ <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../076/1249076.xml">
Tim Witherspoon</link></boxer>
, and now Smith would be getting a rematch with his former conqueror, his second world title fight.</p>
<p>

Knowing of Witherspoon's mental weariness and lack of passion due to a never ending legal war with King, and with a million dollar shot at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../380/93380.xml">
WBC</link> champ <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/39027.xml">
Mike Tyson</link></boxer>
 looming for the winner, Smith came out fast. He dropped the usually durable Witherspoon three times in the opening round, scoring a shocking first round knockout and winning the WBA title. After the Bruno fight it was the second biggest win of his career.</p>
<p>

In March 1987 Smith put up his WBA belt against Tyson's WBC belt in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/47737.xml">
Las Vegas, Nevada</link></village>
 as part of a unification tournament. Tyson tried to throw bombs, and Smith held excessively, losing nearly every round in a boring fight. However it was in the final 30 seconds of the fight that Smith finally decided to let his hands go. A desperation right hand seemed to freeze Tyson, yet it was too late. Smith lost his world title on a wide points decision.</p>

<ss1>

Career end</st>
<p>

He returned to the ring a few months. He took on Brazilian contender <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../708/18118708.xml">
Adilson Rodrigues</link></boxer>
 in <link>
São Paulo</link>, but dropped a very controversial decision.</p>
<p>

In 1989, now aged 36, he took on the young power-punching Jamaican-Canadian <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../244/3826244.xml">
Donovan (Razor) Ruddock</link></boxer>
. Smith's own punch power was still evident as he decked Ruddock hard in the 2nd round, but seemed to punch himself out trying to finish Ruddock, who was a crafty survivor. The next few rounds saw Smith tire, as Ruddock's youth and power overwhelmed him, knocking him clean out in the 7th round for the full 10 count. Ruddock would go on to become a star and feature in several high profile fights. Smith's career appeared to be over. He announced his retirement after the loss and said he would now pursue politics.</p>
<p>

Smith was back in the ring only two months later, KOing journeyman Calvin Jones jaw and followed up with three more knockouts before being matched with former victim <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 in a battle of hard hitting ex-champs. This time Smith was resigned to having to win a dull 12 round points decision over Weaver, although he did score a knockdown in a brief moment of excitement. He also earned the superfluous WBA Americas belt, and a world ranking. </p>
<p>

After a year layoff he was back, now aged 38, and scored six knockouts, including a notable 8 round knockout of the cement-skulled journeyman Everett (Bigfoot) Martin (who had just taken <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</person>
 the distance), and a first round knockout of equally hard hitting ex-contender <link>
Jeff Sims</link>.</p>
<p>

However he lost his world ranking and all his momentum in November 1991 when he dropped a shocking 10 round decision to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/4886177.xml">
club fighter</link> Levi Billups who had a patchy 15-5 record. Smith looked under-prepared as he was banged around and generally outhustled by Billups. He rallied to knock down the underdog in the 9th, however it was too little too late.</p>
<p>

Still active in 1992, now aged 39 and with a 33-9-1 record, Smith regained some credibility with a 10 round decision over <artist wordnetid="109812338" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../864/2297864.xml">
Mark Wills</link></artist>
. His old agitator Don King gave him another opportunity on one of his undercards and matched him with fellow aging warhorse <artist wordnetid="109812338" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../577/642577.xml">
Greg Page</link></artist>
, in a battle of two ex-champs. In the opening round Bonecrusher tried to rush Page as he had done Witherspoon, however was decked himself for his efforts, and was outpunched easily by Page over the 10 round distance.</p>
<p>

In 1993 Smith lost to undefeated southpaw and #1 contender <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../417/214417.xml">
Michael Moorer</link></boxer>
. The paying audience jeered the two passive fighters through to the 10 round finish, where Smith lost a lopsided decision.</p>
<p>

It seemed at this point Smith was boxing now purely for the payday. He competed in the One-Night Heavyweight Tournament in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../275/122275.xml">
Bay St Louis</link> (not included in the official record, counted as show), where a group of heavies of varying quality would fight a series of 3 round fights with the winner being awarded one million dollars. He beat Lester Jackson and Marshall Tillman, before losing in the semi-final to Romanian prospect Dan Dancuta. Smith's old buddy <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 eventually won.</p>
<p>

In 1994 he was matched with power punching Tyson-lookalike <link>
Lionel Butler</link>, who was highly ranked and on a red hot string of knockouts. Smith collapsed in 3 rounds, having offered little resistance. </p>
<p>

Later that year he traveled to Europe to drop a points decision to German <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../829/3945829.xml">

, and then <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../972/76972.xml">

 where he was stopped in 5 rounds due to a cut from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../265/1325265.xml">
headbutt</link>, courtesy of <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/157589.xml">
Brian Nielsen</link></boxer>
. Smith was overweight for both of these fights, and his days as a contender were definitely over.</p>
<p>

He fought on and off for a few more years. In 1998 he traveled to <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/4689264.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../119/412119.xml">

 for an obscure belt, but had to retire after one round when his shoulder popped out. The same injury ended a fight in 1999 with yet another aged fighter, old buddy <boxer wordnetid="109870208" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/140927.xml">

. After this Smith finally saw sense and hung up the gloves, aged 46 and with a record of 44-17-1 (32 KOs).</p>

Life after boxing</st>
<p>

After his retirement from boxing, Smith became an ordained <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../238/739238.xml">
minister</link> and dedicated his life to helping young people stay clear of crime and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../949/25949.xml">
drugs</link>.</p>
<p>

In 2002 Smith started the non-profit organization Champion For Kids Inc. to provide scholarships to high school students. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.championforkids.org/index.html">
