. MOCC is the state's only maximum-security correctional facility and has a current capacity of 1,124 inmates. Construction of MOCC began in the spring of 1991 and was completed in December 1994. The facility was dedicated on December 12, 1994 and received it first inmates on February 14, 1995. Inmate transfers were completed on March 27, 1995 and the West Virginia Penitentiary was closed. Total construction costs for MOCC were $61.8 million. </p>
<p>

The facility's 19 buildings are encompassed by a secure perimeter fence approximately one (1) mile long. Approximately 80 acres are inside the secure perimeter. Extensive use is made of both electronic and manual security controls. </p>
<p>

MOCC operates as a small town, having its own post office, power plant, fuel depot, water supply, central warehouse, maintenance garage, gymnasium, chapel, library, classrooms, food service and laundry. Professionals through contractual agreements provide medical, dental, mental health and food services. </p>
<p>

The WV Department of Education provides many educational and vocational programs for the inmate population such as ABE/GED, Life Skills, Business Education, Culinary Arts and Building Construction. College courses are available through the West Virginia University Institute of Technology. WV Correctional Industries operates an engraving factory, sign and welding shop, janitorial supply factory and manufactures license plates for the WV Division of Motor Vehicles. </p>
<p>

In July 2007, MOCC opened a 48-bed Inmate Work Camp outside of the secure perimeter for inmates holding an appropriate security classification. These inmates provide labor and community service to various agencies/charitable organizations throughout the local area. MOCC also provides these inmates to the WV Division of Highways for various labor projects. </p>
<p>

In September 2007, MOCC underwent an intensive audit by the American Correctional Association. Auditors spent three (3) days at MOCC examining policy, procedures and interacting with staff and inmates. MOCC was found to be in compliance with required national standards and was granted accreditation. MOCC became the fourth WV correctional facility, and is the largest correctional facility in the state, to receive accreditation.</p>
