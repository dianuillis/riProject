, where Malcolm played the main role)</p>
<p>

In the metal newspaper that Joe made is an advertisment. The wealthiest woman in town, Miss Havisham, is willing to pay twenty <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/270673.xml">
quid</link> a day to a little boy who will play with a lonely girl. Pip goes to the Havisham residence to accept the job.</p>
<p>

At the gate, Pip meets Estella, a young girl who takes him to see Miss Havisham. She insults him the whole time. Miss Havisham is in a dark room, and asks Pip, "Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has never seen the sun in over twenty years?" Pip says no, and (stuttering a bit) says "you meet people who have never seen the sun in twenty years a lot these days."</p>
<p>

She tells Estella to play with Pip. Estella doesn't want to; she says, "With this boy? But he is just a commoner!" Upon learning that she can break his heart, she agrees to play "smack the blonde boy in the head with a large log."</p>
<p>

Miss Havisham asks Pip what he thinks of Estella. He thinks she is quite pretty and insulting. Miss Havisham tells Pip to return in a week. Pip soon falls in love with Estella, and dreams about her.</p>
<p>

Eventually, Estella is a little nicer to Pip, and lets him <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/50399.xml">
kiss</link> her. They then walk in the garden. They come across a naked boy, playing in the fountain. Estella casually says that he is another playmate of hers; Pip is not the only one. This makes Pip feel bad; it seems she still does not care about him, and she resumes insulting him. Miss Havisham, who has been watching through a window, is quite happy about this, and says, "Yes, good, she will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces."</p>
<p>

Despite Estella being mean, or perhaps because of it, Pip finds himself falling more and more in love with her every day. This is bad for Pip, because she is rich and he thinks she would never marry a commoner like him. Pip talks this over with Joe, and Joe agrees with Pip.</p>
<p>

Luckily, a man comes in bearing an offer for Pip. An <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../382/181382.xml">
anonymous</link> benefactor, most likely Miss Havisham, has agreed to pay for Pip to go to <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/17867.xml">

, Pip is sent to live with his roommate, Mr. Pocket. Pocket is the boy Pip saw earlier, naked in the fountain. Pip says this is because Miss Havisham is generous, and is paying for both of them to become gentlemen. Pocket says he has nothing to do with Miss Havisham anymore, because she is mad.</p>
<p>

Pocket tells the story of Miss Havisham. He interrupts it to tell Pip whenever Pip does something improper, like passing gas at the dinner table. Each time, Pip apologizes, and Pocket says, "Not at all, I'm sure."</p>
<p>

Miss Havisham grew up as a rich young girl. She was about to marry a man, when he failed to show up at the wedding. He left her a letter, a letter she got at 9:20. Since then, she stopped all the clocks in the house at 9:20, and never looked upon the sun again.</p>
<p>

Pip spent the rest of his time in London learning how to be a gentleman, by learning "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../893/10893.xml">
fencing</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../007/2007.xml">
archery</link>, and how to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../495/46495.xml">
eat box</link>."</p>
<p>

After his time in London, he shows up at Miss Havisham's house to thank her for letting him go to London, and to see if he is good enough for Estella. At this point, Pip learns from Miss Havisham that Estella has been learning how to be a woman. Miss Havisham tells Pip that he can find Estella at a party at the palace on Friday. She sends Pip off, telling him to love Estella. Once she is alone, she again says something threatening about how Estella will break Pip's heart.</p>

<p>

Right when it seems fit for Pip to ask Estella to be his girlfriend, her boyfriend Steve comes in. Steve, anachronistically wearing 21st century American clothing, is seventeen, has a car, and for some reason, is not <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. Estella says (seeming at least somewhat sincere) that she is sorry, but, well, he's seventeen and has a car, so this is how it has to be.</p>
<p>

Pip, saddened, runs to tell Miss Havisham, only to find that she approves of Estella's boyfriend. She tells Pip that things aren't always as they seem. She is glad that Estella has broken Pip's heart. Estella's boyfriend is saddened to know that Estella was just using him to hurt Pip, and Miss Havisham takes joy that his heart is broken as well.</p>

villain</link>, which brings the tale from something somewhat in line with the book to something completely nonsensical, Miss Havisham explains why she has her daughter Estella break hearts. Miss Havisham will use the tears from the men with broken hearts to power her Genesis Device, allowing the old woman to become young again and put herself in Estella's body, and then she will continue breaking men's hearts for another generation. She then uses her <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../781/25781.xml">
robot</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/3069677.xml">
monkey</link>s to attack Pip.</p>
<p>

Pip escapes and falls unconscious. He wakes up, and finds himself in his old house. Joe and Pocket are there. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../382/181382.xml">
anonymous</link> person who sent Pip to London is revealed to be the escaped convict Pip met at the beginning of the story. Because of Pip's kindness, the convict led a life of goodness and became a millionaire. Sending Pip to London was his way of repaying Pip for the good that Pip did for him. The scene ends with Pip realizing that being a real "gentleman" means being good to everyone, and then declaring his intention to stop Miss Havisham's evil plot by saying (in a non english manner, probably to mimic Estella's non english boyfriend) "Let's go kick her ass!"</p>

<st>
Act Three</st>
<p>

The four of them, Pip, Joe, Pocket, and the convict, decide to stop Miss Havisham. They show up too late; Miss Havisham has already started the machine.</p>
<p>

Joe and the convict fight the monkeys. The convict is killed by an acid-spewing Miss Havisham in the struggle, and Joe is overwhelmed the whole time.</p>
<p>

Meanwhile, Pocket tries to get the broken hearted men, who have been hung upside-down over receptacles, not to cry, so they won't power the Genesis Device. He tells them to think of nice things, like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../713/12713.xml">
panda bears</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../742/26742.xml">
stamp collecting</link>. The men find ways to make the nice things sad; panda bears are sad because they are almost extinct, and one man's father died in a stamp collecting accident. The men continue to cry and fuel the machine, and reveal that Pocket is merely boring them to tears.</p>
<p>

Pip tries to convince Estella to leave the machine. He knows she has a heart, and to prove it, he reaches into his sack and pulls out a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/26573.xml">
bunny</link>. He states that no one with a heart would kill a bunny. He gives Estella the bunny. She breaks its neck.</p>
<p>

Pip then says no one with a heart would kill two bunnies. She breaks the second bunny's neck. This continues until they get to the twenty-sixth bunny. She simply doesn't see the point in killing the bunny. Pip says this proves that she has too big a heart to kill twenty-six bunnies. Estella replies that she may be able to kill it after all, but Pip nevertheless gets her to leave the machine.</p>
<p>

This disrupts Miss Havisham's transfer process, destroying the machine and killing Miss Havisham. Joe, Pocket, Estella, and all the men with broken hearts leave the mansion. Estella finally declares her love for Pip, after which Pocket asks for his bunnies back.</p>
<p>

The episode ends with the British Person closing the episode. He declares, "Then they all live happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/15925628.xml">
Hepatitis B</link>."</p>
