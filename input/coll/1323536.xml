<p>

6thMix was intended to be the Next Generation of Dance Dance Revolution. As such, there are many changes. First, the difficulty levels were renamed. Basic' was renamed 'Light', 'Trick' was named 'Standard', and 'Maniac' was named 'Heavy'. They are also given Japanese difficulty names in conjunction: 楽 (<it>raku</it>), 踊 (<it>you</it>), and 激 (<it>geki</it>), respectively.  Their color codes--orange, fuchsia and green, respectively--remain the same. </p>

<sec>
<st>
Gameplay</st>

<p>

<indent level="1">

<it>Main article: <link>
Gameplay of Dance Dance Revolution</link></it>
</indent>

Core gameplay remained mostly the same on 6thMix, with the addition of Freeze Arrows and a new scoring system:</p>
<p>

Freeze Arrows appear as green arrows with a long extension. If they are held for the entire length successfully, a <it>O.K.</it> is scored. If it is not held down for the entire length, a <it>N.G.</it> (no good) is scored. Freezes affect the life bar. Scores are calculated with 2 distinct scoring systems, the <b>long-score</b> system used to determine rankings, and an independent <b>dance point</b> system now used to determine the grade.</p>
<p>

All songs have a long-score ceiling of 50 million points, and a bonus score is tacked onto it based on the difficulty of the song and other factors. Rankings are given for the highest long-score accumulations a round.  If a player plays more than three songs, then it only counts the last three played.  If a song is played repeatedly among the three songs used for ranking, then the repeated songs carry no bonus score.</p>
<p>

The dance-point system uses raw step values to determine the grade. A 'perfect' step adds two points, a 'great' step adds one point, a 'good' step is worth nothing, a 'boo' step takes away four points, and a 'miss' step takes away eight points. An 'O.K.' freeze adds six points, and an 'N.G.' freeze is worth nothing. The dance points are also tied to the life bar. As always, if a player takes too many bad steps and depletes the life bar, they will fail, and the game will end immediately. If the first song is in Light mode, then the game will allow a player to fail that song and continue, but will fail the player out if they fail a second song. In two-player games, if one player fails, they can continue dancing, but it ceases to accumulate dance points for the failed player, accumulates score points at only 10 points per step, and automatically gives the failed player an 'E' for the song.</p>
<p>

The grade is dependent on the number of dance points accumulated: 100% dance points is 'AAA', at least 93% is 'AA', at least 80% is 'A', at least 65% is 'B', at least 45% is 'C' and anything below 45% is a 'D'. If a net dance-point total of zero is obtained without depleting the life bar and, thus, failing, an 'E' ia awarded. The final grade for the entire game is an average of the grades from the last three songs and not derived from the actual dance points scored.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Interface &amp; graphics</st>
<p>

Dancing characters have been removed in 6thMix. Instead, the arrows scroll over clips of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/420534.xml">
full motion video</link>, hence the game does not render any polygons. The screen refreshes at a full speed of 60 frames per second. In addition, the arrows themselves have been tweaked too, now having a rounded edge on their outer tip rather than the V-shaped cut used in all previous games.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Groove Radar</st>
<p>

The Groove Radar is a graphical representation of the difficulty of a song which debuted on <it>DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix</it> which exclusively used the system to represent difficulty instead of foot ratings, the only version to do this. Due to this, the only songs that have no known foot ratings are "Follow Me" and "Flash in the Night", because both songs have yet to appear on a different mix.</p>
<p>

The radar uses 5 categories to represent the difficulty:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Stream</it> - the overall density of the steps in the song.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Voltage</it> - the measure of the peak density of the steps (the highest density of arrows that ever appear on the screen at once).</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Air</it> - the amount of jump steps within the song</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Freeze</it> - the number of freezes (requiring the player to hold a note after it has been pressed initially) in the song (but not the length of the freezes).</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Chaos</it> - the number of steps in the song that don't occur on quarter or eighth notes.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The Groove Radar displays up to two graphs, one for each player, depending on the difficulty they select.</p>

A new options menu accessed by holding down the start button when selecting a song debuted on 6thMix, and is retained on future mixes.</p>
<p>

Some of the available modifiers include Speed mods, which change the arrow speed. Boost, which causes the arrows to accelerate as they near the step zone, Appearance, which changes the appearance of the arrows. Turn mods modify the stepchart itself, Other effects the difficulty of the steps, Scroll changes the scroll direction of the arrows, and Freeze Arrows can also be turned off.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Extra Stage</st>
<p>

New to 6thMix is the "Extra Stage", where players are rewarded for meeting conditions set by the game. If a AA is scored on the final stage on Heavy mode, a message inviting the player to "Try Extra Stage" is shown instead of the Cleared graphic. For the Extra Stage, the song wheel is locked on "MAX 300", and the song is played with several forced modifiers, including 1.5x speed and Reverse. The song is also played in Pressure mode, where the dance gauge starts filled, and can only go down.</p>
<p>

If the player scores a AA or higher on the Extra Stage the game again rewards them with "One More Extra Stage". This time, the song wheel is locked to "CANDY☆", an easier song but with more difficult Modifiers. The exact same modifiers are used, but the song is played in Sudden Death mode, where any step judgment which breaks a combo immediately ends the game. If the player clears the song with a full combo (which is the only way to do so in Sudden Death mode), a special credits movie is shown. When this second Boss Song is passed for the first time it too will be unlocked for normal play, also displayed on the Song Wheel in red.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Link data</st>
<p>

Some machines have the ports to insert PlayStation memory cards.  Such memory cards have to be PlayStation (not PS2) memory cards with Link Data from the home version of DDR 5th Mix (the home version of 6thMix cannot create arcade-compatible Link Data). 5thMix can create two different kinds of arcade link data; the Link Data file for 6thMix is known as "New Version" Link Data and is forward-compatible with 7thMix arcade machines as well.  Link Data serves two primary purposes: Score-saving and Internet Ranking. The user can save his or her scores from arcade performances, and whenever the game is played in the future, the arcade game will load the scores for each user and show them on the song-selection screen to show the player's best performances. These scores can also be viewed at home with 5thMix. 6thMix also provides Internet Ranking codes based on the user's performance in a given set of songs. As with all of Konami's Internet Ranking events, the website for the game would allow users to enter in a generated password which contains their initials and scores for that session, and the website would display the rankings for those who have submitted codes. Link Data saves these passwords so that they may be entered much more conveniently.</p>
<p>

The arcade game can exchange custom stepchart data with 6thMix, as well as any earlier version that has songs that are in 6thMix, though this requires special steps to be taken in 6thMix to write a PlayStation-formatted save file, which must then be copied to the PlayStation memory card by the user.</p>

Songs</st>
<p>

Unlike past DDR versions, songs from previous versions did not carry over to 6thMix, so the song list was completely new.</p>
<p>

Notable songs from this version include:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>MAX 300</b>: As the title suggests, this song plays at 300 BPM, surpassing "DROP OUT". Usually considered to be the first 10-foot difficulty song (on Heavy), though it was not given that rating officially until <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/1457621.xml">
DDRMAX2</link> was released. The Heavy step patterns are fairly simple to many people, but the incredible speed takes a toll on stamina and endurance. The steps briefly pause a minute into the song, offering a slight rest, but they quickly start up again with increased difficulty. The maximum combo of the Heavy steps on Single is 573, a number often used in Konami games for the fact that it is loosely based on a Japanese visual pun. (5 is "go" in Japanese, 7 is "nana" - think "na" - and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/37604.xml">
kanji</link> symbol for 3 can be pronounced as "mi". Hence, "gonanami," or loosely "Konami.") Certain versions of <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">
