automatic number plate recognition</link>. Existing traffic cameras in towns and cities are being converted to read number plates automatically as part of the new national surveillance network.
"What we're trying to do as far as we can is to stitch together the existing camera network rather than install a huge number of new cameras," - Mr Whiteley chairman of the ANPR steering committee said.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

One camera can cover many motorway lanes. Just two ANPR devices, for instance, cover north and south movements through the 27 lanes of the Dartford crossing toll area on the Thames.
Mr Whiteley,said the intention eventually was to move from the "low thousands" of cameras to the " high thousands".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

National ANPR Data Centre</st>
<p>

The National ANPR Data Centre stores all ANPR data feed from the various police and civic CCTV networks in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/1048927.xml">
UK</link>. The National ANPR Data Centre is based at Hendon in north London, the site of the existing Police National Computer. In March 2006 the National ANPR Data Centre could store 50 million number plate 'reads' per day,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> to be expanded to 100 million 'reads' per day within a couple of years. The time, date and place of each vehicle sighting will be stored for five years.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> At the present 50 million clocks a day, over 18 billion ANPR records would be recorded every year.</p>

The <b>National ANPR Data Centre</b> is being built alongside the Police National Computer because of the need to be constantly updated with lists of suspect drivers and vehicles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>
Car Registrations are checked against lists from the Police National Computer, including vehicles of interest to the police for crimes such as burglary or theft of petrol. Uninsured drivers will be identified from data provided by the insurance industry, Vehicles without a valid MoT test certificate will be flagged, vehicles without a valid tax disc or with unlawful number plates will be identified and crimes.</p>
<p>

The <b>National ANPR Data Centre</b> allows analysis across police force boundaries. If a vehicle enters the CCTV network, the police should have an image of it entering the area, which may also show the driver and passenger. As the data generated is stored for 5 years the police argue criminals could be identified and linked to vehicles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

Data mining</st>

<p>

A major feature of the <b>National ANPR Data Centre</b> for car numbers is the ability to data mine. Advanced versatile automated data mining software trawls through the vast amounts of data collected, finding patterns and meaning in the data. Data mining can be used on the records of previous sightings to build up intelligence of a vehicle's movements on the road network or can be used to find cloned vehicles by searching the database for impossibly quick journeys.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

"We can use ANPR on investigations or we can use it looking forward in a proactive, intelligence way. Things like building up the lifestyle of criminals - where they are going to be at certain times. We seek to link the criminal to the vehicle through intelligence. Vehicles moving on the roads are open to police scrutiny at any time. The Road Traffic Act gives us the right to stop vehicles at any time for any purpose" - Frank Whiteley, Chief Constable of <county wordnetid="108546183" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Police</st>

<p>

The police have real-time access to all ANPR camera data. Effectively, the police (and Security Services) would then be able track any car (technically any numberplate) around the country in close to real time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Every police force will have direct computer access to the National ANPR Data Centre. The current restraints on police use of ANPR data have been dictated by pragmatism rather than a concern for civil liberties. Giving every police officer free access to the system would overload the system, "make it unstable, slow it down", said John Dean, National ANPR co-ordinator for the Association of Chief Police Officers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> ANPR records younger than 91 days would "probably" therefore be available only to police analysts, said John Dean.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Intelligence officers will be able to access data on a car's movements over a number of years.</p>
<p>

Police in West Yorkshire are working out how to arm bobbies on the beat with the National ANPR Data Centre. West Yorkshire Police asked RIM, maker of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../339/72339.xml">
Blackberry</link> handheld computer given to his coppers, about the technicalities of an ANPR link. The police have most streets of Bradford covered by ANPR cameras, while Leeds is being wired. "Once that's stable we'll look at taking it onto BlackBerry,"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

This followed the successful rollout of Project Spectrum in which all 43 Police Forces in England and Wales were supplied by the Home Office with an ANPR capable mobile unit, and a 'Back Office'. A subsequent series of trials were then commenced in 2002 when the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../880/2570880.xml">
Vehicle and Operator Services Agency</link> (VOSA) was given funding by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/225695.xml">
Home Office</link> to work with the Police Standards Unit and develop "<b>Project Laser</b>" using the equipment supplied under Project Spectrum.  With the aim of running the ANPR system nationwide, it was initially trialled by nine police forces and ran between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../843/27843.xml">
30 September</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/35502.xml">

The second phase of the project ran between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../856/15856.xml">
1 June</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/36163.xml">

21 June</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link> and involved 23 police forces in total.  The DVLA is also involved with Project Laser, using the system to gather details on unregistered and unlicensed vehicles and those without a valid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/1244583.xml">
MOT certificate</link> or insurance cover.
"Eventually the database will link to most CCTV systems in town centres, meaning that all vehicles filmed on one of the many cameras protecting Bedford High Street, for instance, can be checked against the database and the movements of wanted cars traced to help with serious crime investigations."
— <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/bedfordshirepolice/news/bedfordpolicesearch.taf?function=detail&amp;NewsRelease_uid1=1162">

<p>

The project was seen as a success despite a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/225695.xml">
Home Office</link> report showing that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/192927.xml">
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</link> (DVLA) trial had an error rate of up to 40%, with claims that the system was contributing "…in excess of 100 arrests per officer per year – ten times the national average…"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>
Further findings went on to show that the error rate dropped to 5% when infrared systems and more regular updates of information were used.</p>
<p>

During the second phase of the project around 28 million number plates were spotted in total, with 1.1 million (3.9%) of these matching an entry in one of the databases.  180,543 vehicles were stopped (101,775 directly because of the ANPR system), leading to 13,499 arrests (7.5% of the total) and the issue of 50,910 fines (28.2%).  1,152 stolen vehicles (worth £7.5 million in total), £380,000 worth of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/218449.xml">
drugs</link> and £640,000 worth of stolen goods were also recovered.  The primary goal of the second phase was, however, to see how well the costs of the ANPR system could be covered.  The final conclusion was that less than 10% of the expenditure incurred was recouped, with the Home Office claiming that the failure of drivers to pay fines contributed to this low figure, and continued to recommend the system be deployed throughout the UK. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-and-publications/publication/operational-policing/Driving_Crime_Down_-_Denyin1.pdf?view=Binary">

Funding is now in place for the construction of the National ANPR Data Centre capable of holding 50 million ANPR reads per day, destined to form the basis of a vehicle movement database.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
