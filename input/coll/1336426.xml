The <b>Green Ribbon Club</b> was one of the earliest of the loosely combined associations which met from time to time in London taverns or coffee-houses for political purposes in the 17th century.<p>

It had its meeting place at the King's Head tavern at Chancery Lane End, so was known as the <b>King's Head Club</b>. It seems to have been founded about the year 1675 as a resort for members of the political party hostile to the court. As these associates were in the habit of wearing in their hats a bow, or bob, of green ribbon, as a distinguishing badge useful for the purpose of mutual recognition in street brawls, the name of the club was changed, about 1679, to the Green Ribbon Club. The 'Green Ribbon' was the badge of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/30558.xml">
The Levellers</link> in the English Civil Wars in which many of the members had fought and was an overt reminder of their radical origins.</p>
<p>

 and Claypole, with such profligates as <link>
Lord Howard of Escrick</link> and Sir Henry Blount, and with scoundrels of the type of Dangerfield and Oates. </p>
<p>

An allusion to Dangerfield, notorious among his other crimes and treacheries for a seditious paper found in a meal-tub, is found in connection with the club in <it>The Loyal Subject's Litany</it>, one of the innumerable satires of the period, in which occur the lines:
<indent level="1">

"From the dark-lanthorn Plot, and the Green Ribbon Club From brewing sedition in a sanctified Tub, <it>Libera nos, Domine</it>."
</indent>
The club was the headquarters of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../729/43729.xml">
Whig</link> opposition to the court, and its members were active promoters of conspiracy and sedition. The president was either Lord Shaftesbury or Sir <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/9773184.xml">
Robert Peyton</link>, MP for <subdivision wordnetid="108674251" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/147635.xml">

, who afterwards turned informer. The Green Ribbon Club served both as a debating society and an intelligence department for the Whig faction. Questions under discussion in parliament were here threshed out by the members over their tobacco and ale; the latest news from Westminster or the city was retailed in the tavern, for some or others were continually coming and going, says Roger North, to import or export news and stories.</p>
<p>

Slander of the court or the Tories was invented in the club and sedulously spread over the town, and measures were concerted there for pushing on the Exclusion Bill, or for promoting the pretensions of the Duke of Monmouth. The popular credulity as to Catholic outrages in the days of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/547778.xml">
Popish Plot</link> was stimulated by the scandalmongers of the club, whose members went about in silk armour, supposed to be bullet proof, in which any man dressed up was as safe as a house, says North, for it was impossible to strike him for laughing; while in their pockets, for street and crowd-work, they carried the weapon of offence invented by Stephen College and known as the Protestant Flail.</p>
<p>

The genius of Shaftesbury found in the Green Ribbon Club the means of constructing the first systematized political organization in England. North relates that every post conveyed the news and tales legitimated there, as also the malign constructions of all the good actions of the government, especially to places where elections were depending, to shape men's characters into fit qualifications to be chosen or rejected. In the general election of January and February 1679 the Whig interest throughout the country was managed and controlled by a committee sitting at the club in Chancery Lane.</p>
<p>

The club's organizing activity was also notably effective in the agitation of the Petitioners in 1679. This celebrated movement was engineered from the Green Ribbon Club with all the skill and energy of a modern caucus. The petitions were prepared in London and sent down to every part of the country, where paid canvassers took them from house to house collecting signatures with an air of authority that made refusal difficult.

's accession, were also organized by the club. They ended by the lighting of a huge bonfire in front of the club windows; and as they proved an effective means of inflaming the religious passions of the populace, it was at the Green Ribbon Club that the mobile vulgus first received the nickname of the mob. The activity of the club was, however, short-lived.</p>

, in which many of its members were implicated. In 1685 John Ayloffe, who was found to have been a dubber at the King's Head Tavern and a green-ribon man, was executed in front of the premises on the spot where the pope-burning bonfires had been kindled; and although the tavern was still in existence in the time of <link>
Queen Anne</link>, the Green Ribbon Club which made it famous did not survive the accession of James II. </p>
