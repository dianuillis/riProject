patent</link> law and more particularly the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/1678619.xml">
patentability of so-called business methods</link>. Basically, since this decision, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/44312.xml">
invention</link> is considered eligible for protection by a patent in the United States if it involves some practical application and "it produces a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/1043551.xml">
useful</link>, concrete and tangible result."

 Overview </st>

<p>

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/20054.xml">
March 9</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/34598.xml">
1993</link>, Signature Financial Group, Inc. was granted <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=5193056">
U.S. Patent 5,193,056</weblink><weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.pat2pdf.org/pat2pdf/foo.pl?number=5193056">
&nbsp;</weblink> entitled "Data Processing System for Hub and Spoke Financial Services Configuration". The "spokes" were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/226597.xml">
mutual fund</link>s that pool their assets in a central "hub". That the invention described and claimed in the patent constituted protectable subject matter was affirmed by Court of Appeals for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../782/1196782.xml">
Federal Circuit</link> in July 1998.</p>
<p>

The court held that
<indent level="1">

"(...) the transformation of data, representing discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through a series of mathematical calculations into a final share price, constitutes a practical application of a mathematical algorithm, formula, or calculation, because it produces 'a useful, concrete and tangible result' -- a final share price momentarily fixed for recording and reporting purposes and even accepted and relied upon by regulatory authorities and in subsequent trades."
</indent>

This is considered by many to be significant because previously "methods of doing business" had been widely speculated to be an excluded class of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../565/1043565.xml">
patentable</link> subject matter, although some point out that the issue was never directly addressed by the courts until the <it>State Street</it> decision. </p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../782/1196782.xml">
Federal Circuit</link> in this opinion observed that
<indent level="1">

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/1678619.xml">
business method exception</link> has never been invoked by this court, or the CCPA, to deem an invention unpatentable. Application of this particular exception has always been preceded by a ruling based on some clearer concept of <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title35/title35.html">
Title 35</weblink> or, more commonly, application of the abstract idea exception based on finding a mathematical algorithm.  Illustrative is the CCPA's analysis in In re Howard, 394 F.2d 869, 157 USPQ 615 (CCPA 1968), wherein the court affirmed the Board of Appeals' rejection of the claims for lack of novelty and found it unnecessary to reach the Board's <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+35USC101">
section 101</weblink> ground that a method of doing business is "inherently unpatentable." Id. at 872, 157 USPQ at 617
</indent>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../782/1196782.xml">
Federal Circuit</link> found it unnecessary to carve out a new exception to the principle that "anything under the sun made by man is patentable" (a phrase from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/31737.xml">
U.S. Supreme Court</link> ruling in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/1169761.xml">
Chakrabarty decision</link> based on a 1952 report from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
Congress</link>).  Accordingly, that principle is equally applicable to any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/1678619.xml">
business method</link> that produces a useful, concrete and tangible result. </p>
<p>

According to many, this ruling has been a major impetus behind the recent boom in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/76266.xml">
software</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/1678619.xml">
business method</link> patents. Others argue that the boom started much earlier, i.e., in the early 1990s. Regardless, some commentators &#91;&#93;see the boom as harmful and others as beneficial.</p>
