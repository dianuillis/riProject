<b>Emu oil</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
oil</link> made from the fat of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../894/76894.xml">
emu</link>, a bird native to Australia. It has been used for thousands of years by the Australian aborigines for the treatment of burns, wounds, bruises, and as a pain reliever for bone, muscle, and joint disorders. Emu oil is approximately 70% unsaturated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/10975.xml">
fatty acid</link>s. The largest component is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../100/661100.xml">
oleic acid</link> – a mono-unsaturated fatty acid. Emu oil also contains about 20% <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/880497.xml">
linoleic</link> (Omega 6) acid and 1-2% <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/4421561.xml">
linolenic</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/22594.xml">
Omega 3</link>) acid. There is some evidence to suggest that the oil may have medicinal benefit.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> It is frequently used topically to soften skin and is frequently found in ointments for dry cracked heels.  As well as being part the main ingredient in most "Emu Oil" beauty products, such as natural analgesics, non-surgical facelifts, and wrinkle removers.<p>

Emu oil has been shown in studies to aid in reducing scar formation in healed burn wounds, muscle sprains, and arthritis due to its strong anti-inflammatory properties. "Evaluation of Emu Oil in Lubrication and Treatment of Healed Burn Wounds," S. O’Banion, J. Griswold, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas. American Burn Association, March 18, 1998, Chicago, Illinois.  There is evidence that emu oil is also effective against foot fungus.It has also been shown to help with Excema moderate to severe.</p>

Emu oil is a complete neutral <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/17940.xml">
lipid</link>, since emu oil lacks <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/24505.xml">
phospholipid</link>, making it highly penetrating to the skin.</p>
