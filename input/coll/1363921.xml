After the war he remained with his unit, which remained as an occupying force in Italy until 1946 when they transferred to England.

In England Rachman built up a property empire in north London consisting of more than one hundred mansion blocks and several <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/19321330.xml">

, and the first house he purchased and used for multi-occupation was nearby in now-fashionable <link>
St. Stephen's Gardens</link>, London W2. Adjacent areas in Notting Hill (W11), including Powis Square, Powis Gardens, Powis terrace, Colville Road and Colville Terrace were also early areas where he subdivided and let rooms, initially often for prostitution. Much of this area south of Westbourne Park Road, having become derelict, was compulsorily purchased by Westminster City council in the late 1960s and demolished in 1973-4 to make way for the "Wessex Gardens" estate<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.</p>
<p>

In order to maximise his rental from his properties, he is said to have driven out the, mostly white, sitting tenants of the properties he owned in Notting Hill, who had statutory protection against high rent increases, and then to have packed the properties with recent immigrants from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/18956035.xml">
West Indies</link>.  New tenants did not have the same protection under the law as the sitting tenants had possessed, and so could be charged any amount Rachman wished.  Most of the new tenants were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../039/1580039.xml">
Afro-Caribbean</link> immigrants who had no choice but to accept the high rents, as it was difficult for them to obtain housing in London at the time due to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/26316.xml">
colour bar</link>. Indeed, Rachman's reputation, which he even promoted in the media, was initially as someone who could help to find and provide accommodation for immigrants who otherwise would find it difficult. </p>
<p>

According to his biographer, Shirley Green, certain elements of the traditional story about Rachman, such as the use of violence to drive away the sitting tenants, may be mythical, and more devious methods were used, such as relocating the protected tenants in a smaller concentration of properties or buying them out, in order to minimise the number of tenancies with statutory rent controls. Also, houses were subdivided into a number of flats in order to increase the number of tenancies without rent controls. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

Rachman did not achieve general notoriety until after his death, when the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/100422.xml">

, MP for North Paddington, who coined the phrase "Rachmanism". The subsequent 1965 Rent Act added to the security of tenants, but had the unintended consequence that private rented housing became scarce.</p>

According to his biographer, rather than being the vicious ogre of popular myth, Rachman was an intelligent man with a genial personality. Though not blessed with conventional good looks, being short, balding and dumpy, he had the power to charm women and mixed with all classes of society from prostitutes to the aristocracy. He was flamboyant about the way he displayed his wealth: driving a Rolls Royce, chewing on a Winston Churchill type cigar and sporting dark sunglasses.  Though generally a happy individual he was somewhat conflicted between his Jewish and Polish heritage, due to traditional Polish <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/7628593.xml">
anti-Semitism</link>. Confusion of identity was made worse by the fact that his home town of Lvov was transferred from Poland to the Soviet Union after World War Two, and being denied British citizenship, he was technically <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../996/1116996.xml">
stateless</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> </p>

He got married to long-standing girlfriend Audrey O'Donnell in 1960, but remained a compulsive womaniser, maintaining Mandy-Rice Davies as his mistress at 1 Bryanston Mews West W1, where he had previously installed Christine Keeler. After suffering two heart attacks, Peter Rachman died in <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
