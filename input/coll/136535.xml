The type of marriage prevalent in each culture plays a crucial role in the adoption of differing primogenitures. In Christian Europe, the church had a monopoly on the power to sanction marriage. They discouraged polygamy, divorce and remarriage. Consequently, in Europe, it was extremely difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male line or even by direct offspring. In Islamic, India and Oriental cultures, religion either sanctioned the practice of polygamy or use of consorts, or had no power to sanction marriage. Consequently, monarchs could ensure sufficient numbers male offspring to confirm the succesion. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare or nonexistent. In Japan, the Meiji emperor was the last to have a female consort. While the current system still mandates that the heir to the throne must be a male, there is currently only one male grand child of the current emperor.</p>

Usually, women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture.

A right of succession may also be inherited by a male through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female heir who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood; Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law has been mentioned. In such cases, inheritance was based on uterine kinship<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>.

Preference for males</st>
<p>

The preference for males existing in most systems of primogeniture (and in other mechanisms of hereditary succession) comes mostly from the perceived nature of the tasks and role of the monarch: A monarch most usually was, first and foremost, a military protector.</p>
<p>

It was very useful, or even requisite, that the monarch be a warrior, and a commander of military. And, also, war troops (consisting typically only of males) were perceived to approve only males as their commanders, or even warriors.</p>

Arguments in favour</st>
<p>

Primogeniture prevents the <link>
subdivision of estates</link> and diminishes internal pressures to sell property (for example, if two children inherit a house and one cannot afford to buy out the other's share). In Western Europe, most younger sons of the nobility had no prospect of inheriting property, and were obliged to seek careers in the Church, in military service, or in government. Wills often included bequests to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/19626.xml">
monastic order</link> who would take the disinherited son.</p>
<p>

Many of the Spanish <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/303159.xml">
Conquistador</link>s were younger sons who had to make their fortune in war. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, many younger sons of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

In Japan, the Imperial chronologies include eight reigning empresses from ancient times up through the Edo period; however, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>   <sovereign wordnetid="110628644" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 Arguments against</st>
<p>

The fact that the eldest son "scooped the pool" often led to ill-feeling amongst younger sons (and of course daughters). Through marriage, estates inherited by primogeniture were combined and some nobles achieved wealth and power sufficient to pose a threat even to the crown itself.  Finally, nobles tended to complain about and resist rules of primogeniture (though this opposition might indicate primogeniture among nobles was good for the king).</p>

, was due to the operation of semi-Salic law in Hanover and to male-preference primogeniture in the British Empire. </p>
<p>

In 1890, the divergence of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by  semi-Salic law, was caused by the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than the Dutch one. The Luxembourg succession was ruled by the provisions of the Nassau House Treaty of 1783. Where the succession is concerned, Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-) Nassau-Dietz. The Dutch succession only went back to King William I (1815-1840). Therefore Luxembourg still had agnatic heirs from another branch of the House of Nassau left to succeed, while in the Netherlands the male line starting with William I was depleted. </p>
<p>

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.</p>
<p>

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/69304.xml">
lord</link> was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters. In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title with the suffix <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../237/13170237.xml">
jure uxoris</link></it>.</p>
<p>

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../026/1921026.xml">
proximity of blood</link> and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.</p>

 The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/628922.xml">
Burgundian succession</link> in 1361 was resolved in favor of John, son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than Charles, grandson of the elder daughter. Proximity sometimes favored younger lines (directly contrary to the outcome from applying primogeniture), since it was more probable that from a younger line, a member of an earlier generation was still alive compared with  the descendants of the elder line.</entry>

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.</p>

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, <it>agnatic primogeniture</it> (practically the same as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../740/77740.xml">
Salic Law</link>) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.</p>
<p>

Some countries however accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, Queen <sovereign wordnetid="110628644" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the <legislation wordnetid="106535222" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/12770139.xml">
Statute of Wills</link></legislation>
 was passed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../144/35144.xml">
1540</link>, a will could  control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../016/2065016.xml">
by operation of law</link>. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/1873645.xml">
Administration of Estates Act</link> in 1925.</p>
<p>

In law, the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/16897.xml">
knight</link>). The effect of this rule was to keep the father’s land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England. In the United States primogeniture never became widely established.</p>
