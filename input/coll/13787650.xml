, is a charity (Reg charity no 209642)  that has been supporting the health and wellbeing of dogs, cats and horses since its foundation in 1942. It was awarded a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../943/100943.xml">
Royal Charter</link> on 29 July 1963. The Trust provides specialist <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/32654.xml">
veterinary</link> clinical, surgical and diagnostic services. Appointments for pets and companion animals are through referral only. Many members of the veterinary teams are world leaders in their field, and specialist units include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/56153.xml">
ophthalmology</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../580/66580.xml">
oncology</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/21226.xml">
neurology</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/74553.xml">
dermatology</link>.</p>
<p>

The Trust represents the science behind animal welfare, with its clinics and research facilities working closely together to benefit not only individual cases, but the veterinary profession as a whole, internationally. Disease and injury is the biggest threat to the health of our pets, and we aim to bring these statistics down as much as we can. Our successes in research include major breakthroughs in anaesthesia and surgical techniques, as well as the development of vaccines against diseases such as canine distemper and equine influenza.</p>
