<b>Olive leaf</b> is the leaf of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
olive</link> tree (<it>Olea europaea</it>). While <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link> is well known for its flavor and health benefits, the leaf has been used medicinally in various times and places. Natural olive leaf and olive leaf extracts (OLE), are now marketed as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/712581.xml">
anti-aging</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/2993422.xml">
immunostimulator</link>s, and even <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/1805.xml">
antibiotic</link>s.  Clinical evidence has proven the blood pressure lowering effects of carefully extracted Olive Leaf Extracts.  Bioassays support its antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects at a laboratory level.  A liquid extract made directly from fresh olive leaves recently gained international attention when it was shown to have an antioxidant power almost double green tea extract and 400% higher than Vitamin C.</p>

 History </st>

<p>

Olive leaf extract is derived from the leaves of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
olive</link> tree. Recorded evidence of olive leaf's medicinal use dates back thousands of years: it was used by ancient <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

 and Mediterranean cultures to treat a variety of health conditions. Olive leaf is the first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/4183.xml">

Bible</link> (Ezekiel 47:12) as a natural healer: "The fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine."</p>

<p>

The primary medical constituents contained in unprocessed olive leaf is believed to be the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/3277.xml">
antioxidant</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/12862518.xml">
oleuropein</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/6498688.xml">

 Nutritional and medicinal uses </st>

<p>

Olive leaf and extracts are utilized in the complementary and alternative
medicine community for its ability to act as a natural pathogens killer by
inhibiting the replication process of many pathogens.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> More specifically, it
disables infections long enough for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/14958.xml">
immune system</link> to eliminate them and prevent pathogens from spreading.</p>
<p>

Olive leaf is commonly used to fight colds and flu, yeast infections, and viral infections such as the hard-to-treat Epstein-Barr disease, shingles and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../704/6925704.xml">
herpes</link>.
Olive leaf is also good for the heart. Olive leaf has shown to reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or bad <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/6437.xml">
cholesterol</link>. Researchers have found that olive leaf lowers blood pressure (see below) and increase blood flow by relaxing the arteries.</p>
<p>

Olive leaf harbors <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/3277.xml">
antioxidant</link> properties that help protect the body from the continuous onslaught of free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/9722260.xml">
chemical</link> substances that, when oxidized, can cause cellular damage if left unchecked. Some recent research on the olive leaf has shown its antioxidants to be effective in treating some tumors and cancers such as liver, prostate and breast <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link> but the research on this is preliminary.</p>
<p>

Olive leaf can be taken as a dried leaf tea, powder or capsule.  The leaf extracts can be taken in powder, liquid extract or capsule form though the fresh leaf liquid extracts are quickly gaining popularity due to the broader range of healing compounds they contain.</p>

Side effects</st>
<p>

These may be significant, and may include lowering blood pressure and blood glucose; both of these effects can be life-threatening.  Sufferers of low blood pressure and diabetes are particularly at risk.  Interactions with drugs which cause these effects may be dangerous.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

 Soaps and cosmetics </st>

<p>

Olive leaf extracts are combined with olive oil in soaps and skin creams for application to the skin or other body surfaces.</p>

 Olive leaf tea </st>

<p>

To prepare olive leaf tea, a large teaspoon (approx. 10g) dried olive leaf is placed in a tea ball or herb sack and dropped into two quarts boiling water. The heat is immediately reduced to a medium simmer and the tea let brewed in a covered pot for three to ten minutes with occasional stirring. Tea should be a medium amber color.</p>
