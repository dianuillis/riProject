<b>Cost-utility analysis</b> (CUA) is a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../133/6639133.xml">
economic</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/651604.xml">
analysis</link> used to guide <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/763365.xml">

CUA in health economics</st>

<p>

In health economics, the purpose of CUA is to estimate the ratio between the cost of a health-related intervention and the benefit it produces in terms of the number of years lived in full health by the beneficiaries. Hence it can be considered a special case of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/265128.xml">
cost-effectiveness analysis</link>, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/166789.xml">
Cost</link> is measured in monetary units. Benefit needs to be expressed in a way that allows health states that are considered less preferable to full health to be given <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/861437.xml">
quantitative</link> values. However, unlike <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/374583.xml">
cost-benefit analysis</link>, the benefits do not have to be expressed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../032/297032.xml">
monetary</link> terms. In HTAs it is usually expressed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/1393169.xml">
quality-adjusted life years</link> (QALYs).</p>
<p>

If, for example, intervention A allows a patient to live for three additional years than if no intervention had taken place, but only with a quality of life weight of 0.6, then the intervention confers 3 * 0.6 = 1.8 QALYs to the patient. If intervention B confers two extra years of life at a quality of life weight of 0.75, then it confers an additional 1.5 QALYs to the patient. The net benefit of intervention A over intervention B is therefore 1.8 - 1.5 = 0.3 QALYs.</p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../132/265132.xml">
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</link> (ICER) is the ratio between the difference in costs and the difference in benefits of two interventions. A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../791/41791.xml">
threshold</link> value is often set by policy makers, who may decide that only interventions with an ICER below the threshold are cost effective (and therefore should be funded). </p>

, as of January 2005, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../680/429680.xml">
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence</link> (NICE) is believed to have a threshold of about £30,000 per QALY, although a formal figure has never been made public <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Thus, any health intervention which has an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/2115218.xml">
incremental</link> cost of more than £30,000 per additional QALY gained is likely to be rejected and any intervention which has an incremental cost of less than or equal to £30,000 per extra QALY gained is likely to be accepted as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/265128.xml">
cost-effective</link>.</p>
<p>

In North America, US$50000 per QALY is often suggested as a threshold ICER for a cost-effective intervention.</p>
