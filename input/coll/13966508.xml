 was elected foundation president. Following this branches were established throughout New Zealand.<p>

The League became heavily involved in housing, health, and education. By 1956 the League had 300 branches, 88 district councils and over 4000 members. As president, Dame Whina Cooper became the highest profile Maori women in New Zealand. However Cooper was acting in consultation with the League's executive less and less, and in 1957 she was persuaded to step aside as President. The League's annual conference bestowed her the title "Te Whaea o te Motu" (Mother of the Nation) in 1958.</p>
<p>

The organisation continues to have an annual conference, and be heavily involved in social issues within New Zealand, especially relating to Maori health and education. </p>
