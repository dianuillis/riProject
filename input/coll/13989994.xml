Data storage</link></st>
<p>

The main unit of data storage is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link>, which is a collection of tables with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/199701.xml">
typed</link> columns. SQL Server supports different data types, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/333491.xml">
primary type</link>s such as <it>Integer</it>, <it>Float</it>, <it>Decimal</it>, <it>Char</it> (including character strings), <it>Varchar</it> (variable length character strings), binary (for unstructured <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

 of data), <it>Text</it> (for textual data) among others. It also allows user-defined composite types (UDTs) to be defined and used. SQL Server also makes server statistics available as virtual tables and views (called Dynamic Management Views or DMVs). A database can also contain other objects including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/1960226.xml">
views</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/277251.xml">
stored procedure</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../076/1711076.xml">
indexes</link> and <link>
constraints</link>, in addition to tables, along with a transaction log. A SQL Server database can contain a maximum of 231 objects, and can span multiple OS-level files with a maximum file size of 220 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../657/30657.xml">
TB</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> The data in the database are stored in primary data files with an extension .mdf. Secondary data files, identified with an .ndf extension, are used to store optional metadata. Log files are identified with the .ldf extension.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Storage space allocated to a database is divided into sequentially numbered <it>pages</it>, each 8 KB in size. A <it>page</it> is the basic unit of I/O for SQL Server operations. A page is marked with a 96-byte header which stores metadata about the page including the page number, page type, free space on the page and the ID of the object that owns it. Page type defines the data contained in the page - data stored in the database, index, allocation map which holds information about how pages are allocated to tables and indexes, change map which holds information about the changes made to other pages since last backup or logging, or contain large data types such as image or text. While page is the basic unit of an I/O operation, space is actually managed in terms of an <it>extent</it> which consists of 8 pages. A database object can either span all 8 pages in an extent ("uniform extent") or share an extent with up to 7 more objects ("mixed extent"). A row in a database table cannot span more than one page, so is limited to 8 KB in size. However, if the data exceeds 8 KB and the row contains <it>Varchar</it> or <it>Varbinary</it> data, the data in those columns are moved to a new page (or possible a sequence of pages, called <it>Allocation unit</it>) and replaced with a pointer to the data.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

For physical storage of a table, its rows are divided into a series of partitions (numbered 1 to n). The partition size is user defined; by default all rows are in a single partition. A table is split into multiple partitions in order to spread a database over a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../896/18949896.xml">
cluster</link>. Rows in each partition are stored in either <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../674/4674.xml">
B-tree</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../996/13996.xml">
heap</link> structure. If the table has an associated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../076/1711076.xml">
index</link> to allow fast retrieval of rows, the rows are stored in-order according to their index values, with a B-tree providing the index. The data is in the leaf node of the leaves, and other nodes storing the index values for the leaf data reachable from the respective nodes. If the index is non-clustered, the rows are not sorted according to the index keys. An indexed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/1960226.xml">
view</link> has the same storage structure as an indexed table. A table without an index is stored in an unordered  heap structure. Both heaps and B-trees can span multiple allocation units.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

Buffer management</st>
<p>

SQL Server <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/40821.xml">
buffer</link>s pages in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/25847.xml">
RAM</link> to minimize disc I/O. Any 8 KB page can be buffered in-memory, and the set of all pages currently buffered is called the buffer cache. The amount of memory available to SQL Server decides how many pages will be cached in memory. The buffer cache is managed by the <it>Buffer Manager</it>. Either reading from or writing to any page copies it to the buffer cache. Subsequent reads or writes are redirected to the in-memory copy, rather than the on-disc version. The page is updated on the disc by the Buffer Manager only if the in-memory cache has not been referenced for some time. While writing pages back to disc, asynchronous I/O is used whereby the I/O operation is done in a background thread so that other operations do not have to wait for the I/O operation to complete. Each page is written along with its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../538/7538.xml">
checksum</link> when it is written. When reading the page back, its checksum is computed again and matched with the stored version to ensure the page has not been damaged or tampered with in the mean time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Logging and Transaction</st>
<p>

SQL Server ensures that any change to the data is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/60776.xml">
ACID</link>-compliant, i.e., it uses <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../953/233953.xml">
transactions</link> to ensure that any operation either totally completes or is undone if fails, but never leave the database in an intermediate state. Using transactions, a sequence of actions can be grouped together, with the guarantee that either all actions will succeed or none will. SQL Server implements transactions using a write-ahead log. Any changes made to any page will update the in-memory cache of the page, simultaneously all the operations performed will be written to a log, along with the transaction ID which the operation was a part of. Each log entry is identified by an increasing <it>Log Sequence Number</it> (LSN) which ensure that no event overwrites another. SQL Server ensures that the log will be written onto the disc before the actual page is written back. This enables SQL Server to ensure integrity of the data, even if the system fails. If both the log and the page were written before the failure, the entire data is on persistent storage and integrity is ensured. If only the log was written (the page was either not written or not written completely), then the actions can be read from the log and repeated to restore integrity. If the log wasn't written, then also the integrity is maintained, even though the database is in a state when the transaction as if never occurred. If it was only partially written, then the actions associated with the unfinished transaction are discarded. Since the log was only partially written, the page is guaranteed to have not been written, again ensuring data integrity. Removing the unfinished log entries effectively undoes the transaction. SQL Server ensures consistency between the log and the data every time an instance is restarted.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Concurrency and locking</st>
<p>

SQL Server allows multiple clients to use the same database concurrently. As such, it needs to control concurrent access to shared data, to ensure data integrity - when multiple clients update the same data, or clients attempt to read data that is in the process of being changed by another client. SQL Server provides two modes of concurrency control: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/217356.xml">
pessimistic concurrency</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/233011.xml">
optimistic concurrency</link>. When pessimistic concurrency control is being used, SQL Server controls concurrent access by using locks. Locks can be either shared or exclusive. Exclusive lock grants the user exclusive access to the data - no other user can access the data as long as the lock is held. Shared locks are used when some data is being read - multiple users can read from data locked with a shared lock, but not acquire an exclusive lock. The latter would have to wait for all shared locks to be released. Locks can be applied on different levels of granularity - on entire tables, pages, or even on a per-row basis on tables. For indexes, it can either be on the entire index or on index leaves. The level of granularity to be used is defined on a per-database basis by the database administrator. While a fine grained locking system allows more users to use the table or index simultaneously, it requires more resources. So it does not automatically turn into higher performing solution. SQL Server also includes two more lightweight <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../827/36827.xml">
mutual exclusion</link> solutions - latches and spinlocks - which are less robust than locks but are less resource intensive. SQL Server uses them for DMVs and other resources that are usually not busy. SQL Server also monitors all worker threads that acquire locks to ensure that they do not end up in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../181/105181.xml">
deadlock</link>s - in case they do, SQL Server takes remedial measures, which in many cases is to kill one of the threads entangled in a deadlock and rollback the transaction it started.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> To implement locking, SQL Server contains the <it>Lock Manager</it>. The Lock Manager maintains an in-memory table that manages the database objects and locks, if any, on them along with other metadata about the lock. Access to any shared object is mediated by the lock manager, which either grants access to the resource or blocks it.</p>
<p>

SQL Server also provides the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, which is similar to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/218423.xml">
multiversion concurrency control</link> used in other databases. The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to overwriting the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version of the row. Both the old as well as the new versions of the row are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as Tempdb. When a row is in the process of being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version of the row. If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rows - both of them will be stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Data retrieval</st>
<p>

The main mode of retrieving data from an SQL Server database is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
 querying</link> for it. The  query is expressed using a variant of <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../004/29004.xml">
SQL</link></programming_language>
 called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/295710.xml">
T-SQL</link>, a dialect Microsoft SQL Server shares with <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">
<artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<instrumentality wordnetid="103575240" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/295744.xml">
Sybase SQL Server</link></instrumentality>
</artifact>
</system>
 due to its legacy. The query <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../648/210648.xml">
 declaratively</link> specifies what is to be retrieved. It is processed by the query processor, which figures out the sequence of steps that will be necessary to retrieve the requested data. The sequence of actions necessary to execute a query is called a query plan. There might be multiple ways to process the same query. For example, for a query that contains a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../204/665204.xml">
join</link> statement and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/665285.xml">
select</link>  statement, executing join on both the tables and then executing select on the results would give the same result as selecting from each table and then executing the join, but result in different execution plans. In such case, SQL Server chooses the plan that is supposed to yield the results in the shortest possible time. This is called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/3480761.xml">
query optimization</link> and is performed by the query processor itself.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> </p>
<p>

SQL Server includes a cost-based query optimizer which tries to optimize on the cost, in terms of the resources it will take to execute the query. Given a query, the query optimizer looks at the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/345937.xml">
database schema</link>, the database statistics and the system load at that time. It then decides which sequence to access the tables referred in the query, which sequence to execute the operations and what access method to be used to access the tables. For example, if the table has an associated index, whether the index should be used or not - if the index is on a column which is not unique for most of the columns (low "selectivity"), it might not be worthwhile to use the index to access the data. Finally, it decides whether to execute the query <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../605/2581605.xml">
 concurrently</link> or not. While a concurrent execution is more costly in terms of total processor time, because the execution is actually split to different processors might mean it will execute faster. Once a query plan is generated for a query, it is temporarily cached. For further invocations of the same query, the cached plan is used. Unused plans are discarded after some time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

SQL Server also allows <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/277251.xml">
stored procedure</link>s to be defined. Stored procedures are parameterized T-SQL queries, that are stored in the server itself (and not issued by the client application as is the case with general queries). Stored procedures can accept values sent by the client as input parameters, and send back results as output parameters. They can also call other stored procedures, and can be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../684/40684.xml">
 selectively provided access to</link>. Unlike other queries, stored procedures have an associated name, which is used at runtime to resolve into the actual queries. Also because the code need not be sent from the client every time (as it can be accessed by name), it reduces network traffic and somewhat improves performance.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Execution plans for stored procedures are also cached as necessary.</p>

Services</st>
<p>

SQL Server also includes an assortment of add-on services. While these are not essential for the operation of the database system, these provide value added services on top of the core database management system. These services either run as a part of some SQL Server component or out-of-process as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/5034169.xml">
Windows Service</link> and presents their own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/24th_century.xml">
API</link> to control and interact with them.</p>

<st>
Service Broker</st>
<p>

The Service Broker, which runs as a part of the database engine, provides a reliable messaging and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/429709.xml">
message queuing</link> platform for SQL Server applications. Used inside an instance, it is used to provide an asynchronous programming environment. For cross instance applications, Service Broker communicates over <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../476/15476.xml">
TCP/IP</link> and allows the different components to be synchronized together, via exchange of messages.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

Replication Services</st>
<p>

SQL Server Replication Services are used by SQL Server to replicate and synchronize database objects, either in entirety or a subset of the objects present, across replication agents, which might be other database servers across the network, or database caches on the client side. Replication follows a publisher/subscriber model, i.e., the changes are sent out by one database server ("publisher") and are received by others ("subscribers"). SQL Server supports three different types of replication:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Transaction replication: Each transaction made to the publisher database (master database) is synced out to subscribers, who update their databases with the transaction. Transactional replication synchronizes databases in near real time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></entry>

</p>
<p>

<list>

Merge replication: Changes made at both the publisher and subscriber databases are tracked, and periodically the changes are synchronized bi-directionally between the publisher and the subscribers. If the same data has been modified differently in both the publisher and the subscriber databases, synchronization will result in a conflict which has to be resolved - either manually or by using pre-defined policies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></entry>

The SQL Server Full Text Search service architecture
</caption>
</image>

SQL Server Full Text Search service is a specialized indexing and querying service for unstructured text stored in SQL Server databases. The full text search index can be created on any column with character based text data. It allows for words to be searched for in the text columns. While it can be performed with the SQL LIKE operator, using SQL Server Full Text Search service can be more efficient. Full Text Search (FTS) allows for inexact matching of the source string, indicated by a <it>Rank</it> value which can range from 0 to 1000 - a higher rank means a more accurate match. It also allows linguistic matching ("inflectional search"), i.e., linguistic variants of a word (such as a verb in a different tense) will also be a match for a given word (but with a lower rank than an exact match). Proximity searches are also supported, i.e., if the words searched for do not occur in the sequence they are specified in the query but are near each other, they are also considered a match. T-SQL exposes special operators that can be used to access the FTS capabilities.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>
<p>

The Full Text Search engine is divided into two processes - the <it>Filter Daemon</it> process (msftefd.exe) and the <it>Search</it> process (msftesql.exe). These processes interact with the SQL Server. The Search process includes the indexer (that creates the full text indexes) and the full text query processor. The indexer scans through text columns in the database. It can also index through binary columns, and use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../489/3185489.xml">
iFilter</link>s to extract meaningful text from the binary blob (for example, when a <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../287/20287.xml">
Microsoft Word</link></software>
 document is stored as an unstructured binary file in a database). The iFilters are hosted by the Filter Daemon process. Once the text is extracted, the Filter Daemon process breaks it up into a sequence of words and hands it over to the indexer. The indexer filters out <it>noise words</it>, i.e., words like <it>A</it>, <it>And</it> etc, which occur frequently and are not useful for search. With the remaining words, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/3125116.xml">
inverted index</link> is created, associating each word with the columns they were found in. SQL Server itself includes a <it>Gatherer</it> component that monitors changes to tables and invokes the indexer in case of updates.</p>
<p>

When a full text query is received by the SQL Server query processor, it is handed over to the FTS query processor in the Search process. The FTS query processor breaks up the query into the constituent words, filters out the noise words, and uses an inbuilt <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/30334.xml">
thesaurus</link> to find out the linguistic variants for each word. The words are then queried against the inverted index and a rank of their accurateness is computed. The results are returned to the client via the SQL Server process.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref></p>

 data, in addition to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/25873.xml">
 relational data</link>. For this purpose, it defined an xml data type that could be used either as a data type in database columns or as literals in queries. XML columns can be associated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/185449.xml">
XSD</link> schemas; XML data being stored is verified against the schema. XML is converted to an internal binary data type before being stored in the database. Specialized indexing methods were made available for XML data. XML data is queried using <standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">

</standard>
; SQL Server 2005 added some extensions to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/295710.xml">
T-SQL</link> language to allow embedding XQuery queries in T-SQL. In addition, it also defines a new extension to XQuery, called XML DML, that allows query-based modifications to XML data. SQL Server 2005 also allows a database server to be exposed over <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/93483.xml">

<p>

For relational data, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/295710.xml">

Permissions and access control have been made more granular and the query processor handles concurrent execution of queries in a more efficient way. Partitions on tables and indexes are supported natively, so scaling out a database onto a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../896/18949896.xml">

The current version of SQL Server, <b>SQL Server 2008</b>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> (code-named "Katmai",<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>) was released (RTM) on August 6th, 2008<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref> and aims to make data management <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../382/11462382.xml">
self-tuning</link>, self organizing, and self maintaining with the development of <it>SQL Server Always On</it> technologies, to provide near-zero downtime. SQL Server 2008 will also include support for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../519/8519.xml">
structured</link> and semi-structured data, including digital media formats for pictures, audio, video and other multimedia data. In current versions, such multimedia data can be stored as <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

, SQL Server 2008 can be a data storage backend for <it>different varieties of data: XML, email, time/calendar, file, document, spatial, etc</it> as well as perform <it>search, query, analysis, sharing, and synchronization</it> across all data types.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref></p>
<p>

Other new data types include specialized date and time types and a <it>Spatial</it> data type for location-dependent data.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref> Better support for unstructured and semi-structured data is provided using the <it>FILESTREAM</it> data type has been added, which can be used to reference any file stored on the file system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref> Structured data and metadata about the file is stored in SQL Server database, whereas the unstructured component is stored in the file system.

T-SQL</link> constructs to directly deal with them, without using recursive queries.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../066/4880066.xml">

Spatial data will be stored in two types. A "Flat Earth" (GEOMETRY or planar) data type represents geospatial data which has been projected from its native, spherical, coordinate system into a plane. A "Round Earth" data type (GEOGRAPHY) uses an ellipsoidal model in which the Earth is defined as a single continuous entity which does not suffer from the singularities such as the international dateline, poles, or map projection zone "edges". Approximately 70 methods are available to represent spatial operations for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../855/1043855.xml">

SQL Server includes better compression features, which also helps in improving scalability. It also includes <it>Resource Governor</it> that allows reserving resources for certain users or workflows. It also includes capabilities for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../836/2555836.xml">

T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is the primary means of programming and managing SQL Server. It exposes keywords for the operations that can be performed on SQL Server, including creating and altering database schemas, entering and editing data in the database as well as monitoring and managing the server itself. Client applications, both which consume data or manage the server, leverage SQL Server functionality by sending T-SQL queries and statements which are then processed by the server and results (or errors) returned to the client application. SQL Server allows it to be managed using T-SQL. For this it exposes read only tables from which server statistics can be read. Management functionality is exposed via system-defined stored procedures which can be invoked from T-SQL queries to perform the management operation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref></p>
