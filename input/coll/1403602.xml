<b><it>Scrod</it></b> (or <it>schrod</it>) is a generic term for a young (2.5-lb or less) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../515/41515.xml">
cod</link> or, less frequently, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../822/313822.xml">

 seafood and fish markets.  <p>

A dubious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/11709.xml">
folk etymology</link> holds that the term comes from the acronym "Small Cod Remaining On Dock", but it more likely comes from the obsolete <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

Others&#91;&#93; argue the term comes from either a sign on a wharf in Boston or a restaurant that advertised this kind of generic whitefish as "Special Catch Recorded (sometimes 'Right') On Day."</p>
<p>

Others&#91;&#93; still say that the term was coined by Guy Perry, the ma√Ætre d' for many years at the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../080/3488080.xml">
Parker House Hotel</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/3775.xml">
Boston</link>, to describe the hotel restaurant's "fresh catch" even before the chef returned from the fish market.</p>

Scrod/pluperfect joke</st>

<p>

A grammatical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../267/16267.xml">
joke</link> involving scrod often goes like this:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<it>A businessman arriving in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/3775.xml">
Boston</link> for a convention found that his first evening was free, and he decided to go find a good seafood restaurant that served scrod, a <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 specialty. Getting into a taxi, he asked the cab driver, "Do you know where I can get scrod around here?" "Sure," said the cabdriver. "I know a few places... but I can tell you it's not often I hear someone use the third-person pluperfect indicative anymore!"</it>
</indent>

Contrary to the joke, however, "scrod" is <it>not</it> the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/1841901.xml">
pluperfect</link> of "screw." The "third-person pluperfect indicative", though a legitimate grammatical construction ("he had gone" is the corresponding part of the verb "to go"), is used in the joke for humorous effect only; the structure of the given sentence would not support its use. </p>
<p>

(<it>Minor note</it>: First, the speaker is using first-person, not third-person: <it>I</it> get scrod, not <it>he/she/it</it> gets scrod. Second, <it>I get scrod</it> would be passive, not indicative, which is <it>I screw</it>. The joke travels among linguists as "I've never heard it in the pluperfect subjunctive before." Compare Harper's version referenced in footnote 2, "passive pluperfect subjunctive." Third, the "structure," if that means syntax, does indeed support the joke--the verb is exactly where it's supposed to be. Moreover, the demotic idiom <it>I got screwed</it> as opposed to less demotic but equally idiomatic "I was screwed" is being invoked here. Finally, the joke plays on the English strong verb, in which a root vowel undergoes ablaut: think-thought, speak-spoke, etc. The e-o variation in the joke (screw-scrod) can be seen in speak-spoke, bear-bore, wear-wore. English speakers are so familiar with this particular ablaut series that the joke works. If you tell it right, of course.)</p>
