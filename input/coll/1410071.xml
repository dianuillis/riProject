A <b>benefit society</b> or <b>mutual aid society</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/105070.xml">
organization</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/313347.xml">
voluntary association</link> formed to provide <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../228/62228.xml">
mutual aid</link>, benefit or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/15176.xml">
insurance</link> for relief from sundry difficulties. Such organizations may be formally organized with charters and established customs, or may arise ad hoc to meet unique needs of a particular time and place. <p>

Benefit societies can be organized around a shared ethnic background, religion, occupation, geographical region or other basis. Benefits may include money or assistance for sickness, retirement, education, birth of a baby, funeral and medical expenses, unemployment. Often benefit societies provide a social or educational framework for members and their families to support each other and contribute to the wider community.</p>

History of benefit societies</st>

 in China and among African-Americans during the post-revolutionary years, such as those who organized the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../917/3250917.xml">

<p>

Mutual aid was a foundation of social welfare in the United States until the early 20th Century. Early societies not only shared material resources, but often advanced social values related to self-reliance and moral character. Many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/602117.xml">
fraternal organizations</link> were first organized as mutual aid societies. 
Medieval <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/12369.xml">
guild</link>s were an early basis for many Western benefit societies. </p>
<p>

A guild charter document from 1200 states:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

 "To become a gildsman,..it was necessary to pay certain initiation fees,..(and to take) an oath of fealty to the fraternity, swearing to observe its laws, to uphold its privileges, not to divulge its counsels, to obey its officers, and not to aid any non-gildsman under cover of the newly-acquired 'freedom.'" (C Gross, <it>The Gild Merchant</it>, (1927))
</indent>

This charter shows the importance of 'brotherhood', and the principles of discipline, conviviality and benevolence. The structure of fraternity in the guild forms the basis for orders such as Freemasons, friendly societies, fraternal orders and modern trade unions. Joining such an organisation a member gained the 'freedom' of the craft; and the exclusive benefits that the organisation could confer on members.</p>
<p>

Historically, benefit societies have emphasised the importance of social discipline, in conforming to the rules of the organisation and society, and acting in a morally uplifting  and ethical manner. Conviviality and benevolence are important principles.</p>
<p>

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries benefit societies in the form of friendly societies and trade unions were essential in providing social assistance for sickness and unemployment, and improving social conditions for a large part of the working population. With the introduction in the early twentieth century of state social welfare programs, and industrial, health and welfare regulation, the influence and membership of benefit societies have declined in importance. </p>
<p>

Oaths, secret signs and knowledge, and regalia were historically an important part of many benefit societies, but have declined in use during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In other cases, signs and ceremony have become the mainstay of fraternal societies that no longer focus as much on mutual aid.</p>

<p>

Many of the features of benefit organizations today have been assimilated into organizations that rely on the corporate and political structures of our time. Insurance companies, religious charities, credit unions and democratic governments now perform many of the same functions that were once the purview of ethnic or culturally affiliated mutual benefit associations. </p>
<p>

But new technologies have provided yet more new opportunities for humanity to support itself through mutual aid. Recent authors have described the networked affiliations that produce <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/18938758.xml">
collaborative projects</link> such as <web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

In post-disaster reactions, formal benefit societies of our time often lend aid to others outside their immediate membership, while ad hoc benefit associations form among neighbors or refugees. Ad hoc mutual aid associations have been seen organized among strangers facing shared challenges at such disparate settings as the <festival wordnetid="115162388" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
