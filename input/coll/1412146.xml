Hydrogenated oils are main source for Trans fats. Of all the fats, trans fatty acids are considered to have an adverse effect on blood lipids and immune system. . Dalda is the only brand in Pakistan which produces a banaspati(hydrogenated oils) which is the most popular brand in Pakistan, which happens to be VTF (virtually trans fats free). VTF means that content of Trans Fats in Dalda Banaspati is less than 1% as against other ordinary banaspati brands which contain around 20-25% trans fats.</p>
