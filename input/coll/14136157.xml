<b>Chicken Riggies</b> are native to the Central New York region, specifically the Utica-Rome area. It is a delicious concoction consisting of a variety of hearty ingredients. Chicken Riggies, which is essentially chicken, rigatoni, peppers, onions, in a spicy, cream and tomato sauce is unique to this region. Since this dish is so popular, there is always a debate as to who has the best Riggies. In 2005 a Riggiefest event was first held, and each year continues to be held, to decide who has the best Riggies and who wins the Riggie Cup. </p>

There are many variations of the chicken riggie recipe.  Some include sherry, some people say that you must use a JAR of peppers, because "juice" adds to the sauce.  I have heard that chicken riggies began when someone of importance came to the city of Utica.  The restaurant was closing and the chef "threw together" some chicken, peppers, red sauce, white sauce, garlic, onions, olives, mushrooms.  Through the years, people have added their own twists on the recipe to fit their taste.</p>
