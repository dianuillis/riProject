Oil additives are used to improve the base <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
oil</link> (or oil "base stock") into a better performing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/18069.xml">
lubricant</link>. By utilizing the same base stock, many different oils can be manufactured, each with its own unique properties.<p>

Nearly all <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/216189.xml">
motor oil</link>s currently being sold have an additive package, whether they are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../468/522468.xml">
synthetic</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">

According to a source in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../887/994887.xml">

<it>"A lubricant additive package can comprise anywhere from 1% of a finished <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../812/241812.xml">

Additives in the Aftermarket and Controversy</st>
<p>

Although motor oil is manufactured with numerous additives, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/41910.xml">
aftermarket</link> oil additives exist, too. A glaring inconsistency of mass-marketed aftermarket oil additives is that they often use additives which are foreign to motor oil. On the other hand, commercial additives are also sold that are designed for extended drain intervals (to replace depleted additives in used oil) or for formulating oils <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/379978.xml">
in situ</link> (to make a custom motor oil from base stock). Commercial additives are identical to the additives found in off-the-shelf motor oil, while mass-marketed additives have some of each.</p>
<p>

Some mass-market oil additives, notably the ones containing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../791/30791.xml">
PTFE</link>/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../152/15028152.xml">
Teflon</link> (e.g. <link>
Slick 50</link>)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../080/7270080.xml">
chlorinated paraffins</link> (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/4195574.xml">
Dura Lube</link>)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>, have caused a major backlash by consumers and the U.S. <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/182215.xml">
Federal Trade Commission</link></agency>
 which investigated many mass-marketed engine oil additives in the late 1990s. Although there is no reason to say that all oil additives used in packaged engine oil are good and all aftermarket oil additives are bad, there has been a tendency in the aftermarket industry to make unfounded claims regarding the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/896469.xml">
efficacy</link> of their oil additives. These unsubstantiated claims have caused consumers to be lured into adding a bottle of chemicals to their engines which do not lower emissions, improve wear resistance, lower temperatures, improve efficiency, or extend engine life more than the (much cheaper) oil would have. Many consumers are convinced that aftermarket oil additives work, but many consumers are convinced that they do not work and are in fact detrimental to the engine. The topic is hotly debated on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>.</p>
<p>

Although PTFE, a solid, was used in some aftermarket oil additives, users alleged that the PTFE clumped together, clogging filters. Certain people in the 1990s have reported that this was corroborated by <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/18426568.xml">
NASA</link></agency>
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> and U.S. universities.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> One thing to note, in defense of PTFE, is that if the particles are smaller than what was apparently used in the 1980s and 1990s, then PTFE can be an effective lubricant in suspension.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> The size of the particle and many other interrelated components of a lubricant make it difficult to make blanket statements about whether PTFE is useful or harmful. Although PTFE has been called <b>"the slickest substance known to man,"</b><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> it would hardly do any good if it remains in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../351/4903351.xml">
oil filter</link>.</p>

 research report is purported to say about PTFE oil additives, <it>"In the types of bearing surface contact we have looked at, we have seen no benefit. In some cases we have seen detrimental effect. The solids in the oil tend to accumulate at inlets and act as a dam, which simply blocks the oil from entering. Instead of helping, it is actually depriving parts of lubricant."</it> The source of this quote is unknown, but the quote itself appears in the magazine article referenced below.</entry>
