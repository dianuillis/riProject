biofuel</link> from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../633/633.xml">
algae</link>. Compared with second generation biofuels, algae are high-yield  high-cost (30 times more energy per acre than terrestrial crops) s to produce biofuels. Since the whole organism uses sunlight to produce lipids, or oil, algae can produce more oil in an area the size of a two-car garage than an entire football field of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/62784.xml">
soybean</link>s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><p>

Though there are many factors to overcome for algae to be a wide-spread source of energy, several positive factors can already be considered.  Algal fuels do not impact <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../001/230001.xml">
fresh water</link> resources,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  and can use ocean and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../928/216928.xml">
wastewater</link>.  The cost of various algae species is typically between US$5&ndash;10 per kg dry weight, with research actively looking to reduce capital and operating costs and make algae oil production commercially viable.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

, was tasked with investigating the use of algae for the production of energy.  The program initially focused efforts on the production of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../255/13255.xml">
hydrogen</link>, however, shifted primary research to studying oil production in 1982.  From 1982 through its culmination, the majority of the program research was focused on the production of transportation fuels, notably <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/188551.xml">
biodiesel</link>, from algae. In 1995, as part of the over-all efforts to lower budget demands, the DoE decided to end the program.  Research stopped in 1996 and staff began compiling their research for publication.

Dry algae factor is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../493/64493.xml">
percentage</link> of algae cells in relation with the media where is cultured, e.g. if the dry algae factor is 50%, one would need 2 kg of wet algae (algae in the media) to get 1 kg of algae cells.</p>
<p>

Lipid factor is the percentage of vegoil in relation with the algae cells needed to get it, i.e. if the algae lipid factor is 40%, one would need 2.5 kg of algae cells to get 1 kg of oil.</p>

</sec>
<sec>

 Fuels </st>
<p>

The vegoil algae produce can then be harvested and converted into biodiesel; the algae’s <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/5932.xml">
carbohydrate</link> content can be fermented into bioethanol.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

<p>

Currently most research into efficient algal-oil production is being done in the private sector, but predictions from small scale production experiments bear out that using algae to produce <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/188551.xml">
biodiesel</link> may be the only viable method by which to produce enough automotive fuel to replace current world diesel usage.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
<p>

Microalgae have much faster growth-rates than terrestrial crops. The per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from between 5,000 to 20,000 gallons per acre, per year (4.6 to 18.4 l/m2 per year); this is 7 to 30 times greater than the next best crop, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../238/493238.xml">
Chinese tallow</link> (699 gallons).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

Algae can also grow on marginal lands, such as in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../999/18955999.xml">
desert</link> areas where the groundwater is saline.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
<p>

The difficulties in efficient biodiesel production from algae lie in finding an algal strain with a high <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/17940.xml">
lipid</link> content and fast growth rate that isn't too difficult to harvest, and a cost-effective cultivation system (i.e., type of photobioreactor) that is best suited to that strain.</p>
<p>

Another obstacle preventing widespread mass production of algae for biofuel production has been the equipment and structures needed to begin growing algae in large quantities. Diversified Energy Corporation have avoided this problem by taking a different approach, and growing the algae in thin walled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../385/77385.xml">
polyethylene</link> tubing called Algae Biotape, similar to conventional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../254/757254.xml">
drip irrigation</link> tubing, which can be incorporated into a normal agricultural environment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> </p>
<p>

Open-pond systems for the most part have been given up for the cultivation of algae with high-oil content.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> Many believe that a major flaw of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../456/4584456.xml">
Aquatic Species Program</link> was the decision to focus their efforts exclusively on open-ponds; this makes the entire effort dependent upon the hardiness of the strain chosen, requiring it to be unnecessarily resilient in order to withstand wide swings in temperature and pH, and competition from invasive algae and bacteria. Open systems using a monoculture are also vulnerable to viral infection. The energy that a high-oil strain invests into the production of oil is energy that is not invested into the production of proteins or carbohydrates, usually resulting in the species being less hardy, or having a slower growth rate. Algal species with a lower oil content, not having to divert their energies away from growth, have an easier time in the harsher conditions of an open system.</p>

Some open sewage ponds trial production has been done in <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">

<p>

In a closed system (not exposed to open air) there is not the problem of contamination by other
organisms blown in by the air.  The problem for a closed system is finding a cheap source of sterile <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/5906.xml">
carbon dioxide</link> (CO2).
Several experimenters have found the CO2 from a smokestack works well for growing algae.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref>  To be economical, some experts think that
algae farming for biofuels will have to be done next to power plants, where they can also help soak up the pollution.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
<p>

A feasibility study using marine microalgae in a photobioreactor is being done by The International Research Consortium on Continental Margins at the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.iu-bremen.de/">
International University Bremen</weblink>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref></p>
<p>

Research into algae for the mass-production of oil is mainly focused on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/6983768.xml">
microalgae</link>; organisms capable of photosynthesis that are less than 0.4&nbsp;mm in diameter, including the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../374/46374.xml">
diatoms</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../618/129618.xml">
cyanobacteria</link>; as opposed to macroalgae, e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../983/18597983.xml">
seaweed</link>. However, some research is being done into using seaweeds for biofuels, probably due to the high availability of this resource.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref>  This preference towards microalgae is due largely to its less complex structure, fast growth rate, and high oil content (for some species). Some commercial interests into large scale algal-cultivation systems are looking to tie in to existing infrastructures, such as coal power plants or sewage treatment facilities. This approach not only provides the raw materials for the system, such as CO2 and nutrients; but it changes those wastes into resources.</p>

Algae cultivation</st>
<p>

Algae grow rapidly and can have a high percentage of lipids, or oils. They can double their mass several times a day and produce at least 15 times more oil per acre than alternatives such as rapeseed, palms, soybeans, or jatropha. Moreover, algae-growing facilities can be built on coastal land unsuitable for conventional agriculture. </p>
<p>

The hard part about algae production is growing the algae in a controlled way and harvesting it efficiently. </p>
<p>

Most companies pursuing algae as a source of biofuels are pumping nutrient- water through plastic tubes (called "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/616670.xml">
bioreactor</link>s" ) that are exposed to sunlight (and so called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/616670.xml">
photobioreactor</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/630431.xml">
PBR</link>).</p>
<p>

Running a PBR is more difficult than a open <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/18842299.xml">
pond</link>, and more costly.</p>

Algal nutrient solutions</link></it>
</indent>

Nutrients like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/21175.xml">
nitrogen</link> (N), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/23318.xml">
phosphorous</link> (P), and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../055/23055.xml">
potassium</link> (K), are important for plant growth and are essential parts of fertilizer.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/43710.xml">
Silica</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/14734.xml">
iron</link> may also be considered important marine nutrients as the lack of one can limit the growth of, or productivity in, an area.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref></p>
<p>

Another possible nutrient source is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../928/216928.xml">
waste water</link> from the treatment of sewage, agricultural, or flood plain run-off, all currently major pollutants and health risks. However, this waste water cannot feed algae directly and must first be processed by bacteria, through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/1545608.xml">
anaerobic digestion</link>. If waste water is not processed before it reaches the algae, it will contaminate the algae in the reactor, and at the very least, kill much of the desired algae strain. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/54838.xml">
biogas</link> facilities, organic waste is often converted to a mixture of <link>
carbon dioxide</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/18582230.xml">
methane</link>, and organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer that comes out of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/1400329.xml">
digester</link> is liquid, and nearly suitable for algae growth, but it must first be cleaned and sterilized.</p>
<p>

One company, Green Star Products, announced their development of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/1148672.xml">
micronutrient</link> formula to increase the growth rate of algae. According to the company, its formula can increase the daily growth rate by 34% and can double the amount of algae produced in one growth cycle.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref></p>
