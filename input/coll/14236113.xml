Synopsis</st>
<p>

In <it>How Children Fail</it> John Holt states his belief that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../987/128987.xml">
children</link> love to learn, but hate to be taught. His experiences in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/1214654.xml">
classroom</link> as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../075/205075.xml">
teacher</link> and researcher brought him to the conclusion that all children are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../280/519280.xml">
intelligent</link>. They become unintelligent because they are accustomed by teachers and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../022/28022.xml">
school</link>s to strive only for teacher <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../368/188368.xml">
approval</link> and for the “<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/51490.xml">
right</link>” <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/642.xml">
answer</link>s, and to forget all else. In this system, children see no value in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../080/37080.xml">
thinking</link> and discovery, but see it only in playing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/18723138.xml">
game</link> of school. </p>
<p>

Children believe that they must please the teacher, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/167334.xml">
adult</link>s, at all costs. They learn how to manipulate teachers to gain clues about what the teacher really wants. Through the teacher’s <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../663/366663.xml">
body language</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../760/242760.xml">
facial expression</link>s and other clues, they learn what might be the right answer. They mumble, straddle the answer, get the teacher to answer her own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/502038.xml">
question</link>, and take wild guesses while waiting to see what happens- all in order to increase the chances for a right answer. </p>
<p>

When children are very young, they have natural curiosities about the world and explore them, trying diligently to figure out what is real. As they become “producers”, rather than “thinkers”, they fall away from exploration and start fishing for the right answers with little thought. They believe they must always be right, so they quickly forget <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../475/216475.xml">
mistake</link>s and how these mistakes were made. They believe that the only good response from the teacher is “yes”, and that a “no” is defeat. </p>
<p>

They <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/10828.xml">
fear</link> wrong answers and shy away from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/946966.xml">
challenge</link>s because they may not have the right answer. This fear that rules them in the school setting does their thinking and learning a great disservice. A teacher’s job is to help them overcome their fears of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../769/19005769.xml">
failure</link> and explore the problem for real learning. So often, teachers are doing the opposite- building children’s fears up to monumental proportions. Children need to see that failure is honorable, and that it helps them construct <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/18916.xml">
meaning</link>. It should not be seen as humiliating, but as a step to real learning. Being afraid of mistakes, they never try to understand their own mistakes and cannot and will not try to understand when their thinking is faulty. Adding to children’s fear in school is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/55169.xml">
corporal punishment</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../834/205834.xml">
humiliation</link>, both of which can scare children into right/wrong thinking and away from their natural exploratory thinking.</p>
<p>

Holt maintains that when teachers praise students, they rob them of the joy of discovering truth for themselves. They should be aiding them by guiding them to explore and learn as their interests move them. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/18831.xml">
mathematics</link>, children learn <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithms</link>, but when faced with problems with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/1549329.xml">
Cuisenaire rods</link>, they cannot apply their learning to real situations. Their learning is superficial in that they can sometimes spit out the algorithm when faced with a problem on paper, but have no understanding of how or why the algorithm works and no deep understanding about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../690/21690.xml">
number</link>s. </p>
<p>

Holt believes that end of year <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/11717483.xml">
achievement test</link>s do not show real learning. Teachers (Holt included) generally <know-how wordnetid="105616786" confidence="0.8">
<method wordnetid="105660268" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/13195412.xml">
cram</link></method>
</know-how>
 for these tests in the weeks preceding. Meanwhile, the material learned is forgotten shortly after the tests because it was not motivated by interest, nor does it have practical use.</p>
