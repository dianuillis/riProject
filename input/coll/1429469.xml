<b>Sensible Erection</b> (SE) describes itself as "an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../537/17253537.xml">

Sensible Election</weblink>; its political ghetto. </p>
<p>

The site was originally created by "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../100/3918100.xml">
teh</link> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.sensibleerection.com/profile.php/1">
matt</weblink>
" (his username) for his personal blogging and as a community portal for friends. It quickly grew and was eventually sold to "<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.sensibleerection.com/profile.php/2405">
Saint_Marck</weblink>", who runs the site today.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

SE uses a moderation system inspired by <web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../715/26715.xml">
Slashdot</link></web_site>
, but extends its application from discussions alone to include front page articles. Users may post articles directly to the front page, without an intermediate editorial approval process; however, in order to post they must have been registered for at least 15 days. Registered users of the site may vote for articles either positively or negatively under different labels, (e.g. +1 Interesting or -1 WTF), depending on how interesting, relevant, or tasteful/tasteless they are.  Each user may enable filters that remove posts below a certain numerical score from their view of the front page. This opt-in self censorship preserves freedom of speech, while allowing a user the ability to quickly browse through articles. Highly controversial posts often get positive scores with negative labels, such as the occasional +10 Unworthy Self Link. (See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Post+scoring%22])">
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Post scoring</entry>
</list>
</link>.)  This scoring system also applies to article comments. Users have a "karma" score they receive for posting well-received articles and comments.  If a user's karma score drops below 1, they are prevented from posting articles to the front page until they can regain karma by posting insightful comments to other articles.  In this manner, the users of SE are allowed to moderate each other by voting which articles and comments are "good" and which are "bad".</p>

Post scoring</st>
<p>

Posts can have a score in the inclusive range [-10, +10]. The score is given by this algorithm:</p>
<p>


score = 0
for each moderation M:
    score += M
    score = max(-10, score)
    score = min(+10, score)
end for
</p>
<p>

The order of the moderations is important. If the SUM of moderations is 15, but the final moderation given is -1, the score will be +9, not +10 as may be expected. The rationale for this method is that when a person moderates "against the grain," there is an emotional need to have instant gratification. If you negatively moderate an entry which appears as +10, you expect it to become +9. You would be surprised if positive mods beyond the cap kept the score from changing as a result of your actions.</p>
<p>

The possible moderations are:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +2 Classy Pr0n</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +2 Funny</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Good</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Hot Pr0n</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Informative</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Insightful</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Interesting</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Laser (retired)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Original</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 Underrated</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 +1 WTF</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Bad</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Bad Pr0n</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Boring</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Flamebait</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Illegal Pr0n</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Old</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Overrated</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Repost</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Troll</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -1 Unworthy Self Link</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -3 WTF</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 -100 Wrong Category</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The score for the post may also include one of the labels listed above. The final label which tags the post score is decided by a simple majority, which makes final scores like “+1 Illegal Pr0n” possible (and, indeed, much sought after).</p>
