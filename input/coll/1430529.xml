<b>Market timing</b> is the strategy of making buy or sell decisions of financial assets (often <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/19372783.xml">
stock</link>s) by attempting to predict future market price movements. The prediction may be based on an outlook of market or economic conditions resulting from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../577/112577.xml">
technical</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../684/11684.xml">
fundamental analysis</link>. This is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../614/1925614.xml">
investment strategy</link> based on the outlook for an aggregate market, rather than for a particular financial asset.<p>

Whether market timing is ever a viable investment strategy is controversial. Some may consider market timing to be a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/11921.xml">
gambling</link> based on pure <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/19196523.xml">
chance</link> because they do not believe in the possibility of predicting future financial prices. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/164602.xml">
efficient market theory</link> suggests that financial prices often exhibit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../451/235451.xml">
random walk</link> behavior and thus can not be predicted with consistency. Some consider market timing to be sensible in certain situations, such as an apparent <condition wordnetid="113920835" confidence="0.8">
<state wordnetid="100024720" confidence="0.8">
<problem wordnetid="114410605" confidence="0.8">

</condition>
. However, because the economy is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/37438.xml">
complex system</link> that contains many factors, even at times of significant market optimism or pessimism, it often remains difficult, if not impossible, to pre-determine the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../420/298420.xml">
local maximum or minimum</link> of future prices with any precision; a so-called bubble can last for many years before prices collapse. Likewise, a <condition wordnetid="113920835" confidence="0.8">
<state wordnetid="100024720" confidence="0.8">

 can persist for extended periods; stocks that appear to be "<it>cheap</it>" at a glance can often become much <it>cheaper</it> afterwards before either rebounding at some time in the future or heading toward <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/4695.xml">
bankruptcy</link>.</p>
<p>

A major stumbling block for many market timers is the phenomenon of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../425/555425.xml">
curve fitting</link>. This means that a given set of trading rules has been optimized to fit the particular dataset for which it has been back-tested. Unfortunately optimized trading rules often fail to work on future data. Market timers attempt to avoid these difficulties in a number of ways. One is by looking for clusters of parameter values which work particularly well<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. Another is using out-of-sample data, which ostensibly allows the market timer to see how the system will work on unforeseen data. However, critics charge that once the strategy has been revised to reflect such data it is no longer "out-of-sample".</p>
<p>

Several independent organizations (e.g., Timer Digest and Hulbert Financial Digest) have tracked some market timers' performance for in some cases over thirty years.  In many of these cases, they have found that purported market timers do no better than chance or even worse.  However, some have proven to be reliable for the entire thirty year period with performances that substantially exceed the performance of the general stock market or the sectors that the market timer invests in. <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 Renaissance Technologies Medallion Hedge Fund has consistently outperformed the market. The fund allegedly uses mathematical models developed by Ellwyn Berlekamp <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>.  Efficient market theory has also been criticized as an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/226673.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Controversy%22])">

 methodology. </p>

A recent study suggested that the best predictor for a fund to consistently outperform the market was low expenses and low turnover, not pursuing a value or contrarian strategy.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>  However, other studies have concluded that some simple strategies will outperform the overall market.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  One market timing strategy is referred to as <link>

 in 2003 where some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/226597.xml">
mutual fund</link>s "secretly" allowed select investors to rapidly trade the portfolio despite statements banning the practice in the prospectus. The scandal did not involve market timing per se, and market timing is not itself illegal. However, it involved permitting selected investors to make frequent and repeated trades during the day while permitting general investors to trade only at the close of business, which permitted the favored investors to take advantage of market timing strategies. A double standard that favors one investor at the expense of another is illegal and undermines the credibility of the industry"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>  In this instance, the market timing frequently involved predictions of the performance of how international markets would respond to the day's trading in the US. This scandal also involved <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../624/1430624.xml">
late trading</link>.</p>

Mutual fund flow</link>s are published by organizations such as <group wordnetid="100031264" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/4727315.xml">
Investment Company Institute</link></group>
 and <link>
TrimTabs</link>. These show that flows generally track the overall level of the market. For example, the largest <it>in</it>flows to stock mutual funds were in early 2000 while the largest outflows were in mid 2002.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> It is good to note that these mutual fund flows were near the start of a significant <it>bear</it> (downtrending) market and <it>bull</it> (uptrending) market respectively.</p>
<p>

This mutual fund flow data would seem to indicate that most investors attempt to prescribe to a <link>
buy high, sell low</link> strategy. However, studies confirm that the general tendency of investors is to buy <it>after</it> a stock or mutual fund price has already increased. This creates a surge in the number of buyers which then drives the price even higher. However, when the supply of buyers becomes exhausted, the demand (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/29664.xml">
supply and demand</link>) for the stock declines and the stock or fund price also declines.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

The famous <link>
Dalbar study</link> found that the average investor's return in stocks is much less than the amount that would have been obtained by simply holding an index fund consisting of all stocks contained in the <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/164602.xml">
efficient market hypothesis</link> (EMH) says that market timing strategies do not work. EMH says that the investment return created by a strategy that is 50% of the time in cash and 50% of the time in stocks should be similar to a strategy that is 50% invested in stocks and 50% in cash <it>at all times</it> (plus variations for random error). </p>

Proponents of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/164602.xml">

behavioral finance</link> claim that investors are irrational but their biases <it>are</it> consistent and predictable.</p>
