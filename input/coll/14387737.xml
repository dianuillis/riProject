IBM originally intended that System/360 should have only one batch-oriented operating system, OS/360. It also intended to  supply a separate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/30958.xml">
timesharing</link> operating system, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../358/6253358.xml">
TSS/360</link>. There are at least two accounts of why IBM eventually decided to produce other, simpler batch-oriented operating systems: because it found that OS/360 would not fit into the limited memory available on the smaller System/360 models;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> or because it realized that the development of OS/360 would take much longer than expected. IBM introduced a series of stop-gaps to prevent System/360 hardware sales from collapsing&mdash;first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/140635.xml">
BOS/360</link> (Basic Operating System, for the smallest, card-only machines), then <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/140634.xml">
TOS/360</link> (Tape Operating System, for machines with only tape drives), and finally <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/626229.xml">
DOS/360</link> (Disk Operating System), which became a mainstream operating system and is the ancestor of to-day's widely used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../682/32682.xml">
z/VSE</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

IBM released three variants of OS/360: <b>PCP</b> (Primary Control Program), a short-lived stop-gap which could run only one job at a time, in 1966; MFT (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../857/6857.xml">
<b>M</b>ultiprogramming</link> with <b>F</b>ixed number of <b>T</b>asks) for the mid-range machines, and MVT (<b>M</b>ultiprogramming with <b>V</b>ariable number of <b>T</b>asks) for the top end.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> MFT and MVT were used until at least the late 1970s, a good five years after their successors had been launched.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> It is unclear whether the division between OS/MFT and OS/MVT arose because MVT required too much memory to be usable on mid-range machines or because IBM needed to release a multiprogramming version of OS (MFT) as soon as possible. Initially IBM maintained that MFT and MVT were simply "two configurations of the [OS/360] control program", although later IBM described them as "separate versions of OS/360".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

TSS/360 was so late and unreliable that IBM cancelled it. By this time <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../718/315718.xml">
CP-67</link> was running well enough for IBM to offer it "without warranty" as a timesharing facility for a few large customers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

<st>
OS/MFT and OS/MVT</st>
<p>

These two systems offered such similar facilities that porting applications between them usually required minimal effort, and the same versions of IBM "Program Products" (application and utility software) ran on both.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
OS/MFT</st>
<p>

MFT differed from MVT mainly in the way in which it managed memory: when installing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/2660651.xml">
 MFT</link>, customers would specify a fixed number of  "partitions", areas of memory with fixed boundaries, in which application programs could be run simultaneously.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Experience indicated that it was not advisable to install OS/MFT on systems with less than 256 KB of memory, which in the 1960s was quite a large amount.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 OS/MVT </st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../232/39232.xml">
OS/MVT</link> was considerably larger and more complex than MFT and therefore was used on the most powerful System/360 CPUs.  It treated all memory not used by the operating system as a single pool from which contiguous "regions" could be allocated as required by an indefinite number of simultaneous application programs.  This scheme was more flexible than MFT's and in principle used memory more efficiently, but was liable to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/3909369.xml">
 fragmentation</link> - after a while one could find that, although there was enough spare memory in total to run a program, it was divided into separate chunks none of which was large enough.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Shortly after the release of MVT, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/212150.xml">
Time Sharing Option</link> (TSO) was added.  TSO became widely used for program development because it provided: an editor; the ability to submit batch jobs, be notified of their completion and view the results without waiting for printed reports; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/50485.xml">
debugger</link>s for some of the programming languages used on System/360. TSO communicated with terminals by using TCAM (Telecommunications Access Method).  TCAM's name suggests that IBM hoped it would become the standard access method for data communications, but in fact TCAM was used almost entirely for TSO and was largely superseded by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/864826.xml">
VTAM</link> in the mid to late 1970s.</p>

An additional file structure, partitioned, and access method (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/13578642.xml">
BPAM</link>), was mainly used for managing program libraries.  Although partitioned files needed to be compressed to reclaim free space, this seldom halted development work as it did with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/626229.xml">
DOS/360</link>'s Core Image Library, because MFT and MVT allowed an indefinite number of partitioned files and each project generally had at least one.</entry>

Generation Data Groups (GDGs) were originally designed to support <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/1107031.xml">
 grandfather-father-son backup procedures</link> - if a file was modified, the changed version became the new "son", the previous "son" became the "father", the previous "father" became the "grandfather" and the previous "grandfather" was deleted. But one could set up GDGs with a lot more than 3 generations, and some applications used GDGs to collect data from large and variable numbers of sources and feed the information to one program - each collecting program created a new generation of the file and the final program read the whole group as a single sequential file (by not specifying a generation in the JCL).</entry>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

The file naming system allowed files to be managed as hierarchies, e.g. <it>PROJECT.USER.FILENAME</it>. This was simply a naming convention, as MFT and MVT lacked the concept of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/5515027.xml">

Hence IBM also committed to delivering enhanced operating systems which could support the use of virtual memory.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/9815217.xml">
OS/VS1</link> was the successor to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/2660651.xml">
 OS/MFT</link>, and offered identical facilities apart from the addition of virtual memory and VSAM (see below).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> IBM released fairly minor enhancements of OS/VS1 until 1983, and in 1984 announced that there would be no more.

OS/VS2 was initially just <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/19161423.xml">
OS/MVT</link> plus virtual memory and VSAM (see below).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> But in 1974 IBM released what it described as OS/VS2 release 2 but which was really a new operating system that was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/4459.xml">
 upwards-compatible</link> with OS/VS2 release 1. The new system had been largely rewritten in a new language, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/1033828.xml">
PL/S</link>, which was a dialect of <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../708/23708.xml">

The new version's most noticeable feature was that it supported multiple virtual address spaces - different applications thought they were using the same range of virtual addresses, but the new system's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/32354.xml">
virtual memory</link> facilities mapped these to different ranges of real memory addresses. Each application's address space consisted of 3 areas: operating system (one instance shared by all jobs); an application area which was unique for each application; shared virtual area which was used for various purposes including inter-job communication. IBM promised that the application areas would always be at least 8MB. This approach eliminated the risk of memory <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/329777.xml">
fragmentation</link> that was present in MVT and SVS, and improved the system's internal security.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> The new system rapidly became known as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/19649.xml">
MVS</link>" (Multiple Virtual Storages), the original OS/VS2 became known as "SVS" (Single Virtual Storage) and IBM itself accepted this terminology and labelled MVS's successors "MVS/<it>xxx</it>".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

MVS introduced a new approach to workload management, allowing users to define performance targets for high-priority batch jobs. This enabled users to to give their systems more work than before without affecting the performance of the highest-priority jobs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

MVS was IBM's first mainstream operating system to support what IBM called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/50318.xml">
 "tightly-coupled multiprocessing"</link>, in which 2 (later up to 8) CPUs shared concurrent access to the same memory (and copy of the operating system) and peripherals, providing greater processing power and a degree of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../729/2573729.xml">
graceful degradation</link> if one CPU failed.</p>
<p>

Initially MVS was supplied with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/4019422.xml">
job queue</link> manager called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../191/1356191.xml">
JES2</link> (Job Entry Subsystem 2), which was descended from HASP (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/8977072.xml">
Houston Automated Spooling Program</link>) and also supported <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/2015398.xml">

</direction>
</protocol>
</message>
 from workstations located elsewhere. JES2 could only manage jobs for one CPU (which might be a tightly-coupled multiprocessor system). In 1976 IBM provided another option, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../191/1356191.xml">
JES3</link> (Job Entry Subsystem 3), a descendant of ASP (Attached Support Processor), which allowed one CPU to manage a single job queue feeding work to several physically distinct CPUs, and therefore allowed one operator's console to manage the work of all those CPUs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Note: JES1 was the job queue manager for OS/VS1 (see above).</p>

 Entry-Sequenced Datasets (ESDS) provide facilities similar to those of both sequential and BDAM (direct) datasets, since they can be read either from start to finish or directly by specifying an offset from the start.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Key-Sequenced Datasets (KSDS) are a major upgrade from IBM's ISAM: they allowed secondary keys with non-unique values and keys formed by concatenating non-contiguous fields in any order; they greatly reduced the performance problems caused by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../475/41475.xml">
overflow</link> records in ISAM; and they greatly reduced the risk that a software or hardware failure in the middle of an index update might corrupt the index. VSAM provided an ISAM / VSAM Interface which allowed ISAM-based applications to use VSAM KSDS without reprogramming.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Relative Record Datasets (RRDS) are a replacement for direct access (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../030/16245030.xml">

VSAM also provides a catalog facility which enables applications to access files by name, without needing to know which disk drive(s) they are on. VSAM datasets <it>must</it> be defined in a VSAM catalog before they are used, and non-VSAM datasets can also be listed in a VSAM catalog.

In 1974 IBM announced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../267/78267.xml">
Systems Network Architecture</link>, which was meant to reduce the cost of running large networks of terminals, mainly by using communications lines much more efficiently. This was only available for users of IBM's virtual memory operating systems, since its mainframe software component, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/864826.xml">

virtual address</link>ing hardware was later developed for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/59785.xml">
System/370</link>, the OS/360 systems were upgraded and renamed; MFT became <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/9815217.xml">
OS/VS1</link></b> and MVT became <b>OS/VS2</b>. OS/VS2 was announced in two forms: <b>OS/VS2 Release 1</b>, aka <b>SVS</b> (Single Virtual Storage) and <b>OS/VS2 Release 2</b>, aka <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/19649.xml">
MVS</link></b> (Multiple Virtual Storage). SVS was intended as a stepping stone from MVT to MVS, and is only of historical interest today. MVS is still used on the latest members of the IBM 360 Series and its successors, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/59785.xml">
