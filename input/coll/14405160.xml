In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/21245.xml">
neuroscience</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/5323.xml">
computer science</link>, <b>synaptic weight</b> refers to the strength or amplitude of a connection between two nodes, corresponding in biology to the amount of influence the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../998/156998.xml">
firing</link> of one <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../120/21120.xml">
neuron</link> has on another. The term is typically used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/2839842.xml">
artificial neural network</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/1726672.xml">

In a computational neural network, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/292688.xml">
vector</link> or set of inputs <math>\textbf{x}</math> and outputs <math>\textbf{y}</math>, or pre- and post-synaptic neurons respectively, are interconnected with synaptic weights represented by the matrix <math>w</math>, where for a linear neuron</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>y_j = \sum_i w_{ij} x_i ~~\textrm{or}~~ \textbf{y} = w\textbf{x}</math>.
</indent>

The synaptic weight is changed by using a learning rule, the most basic of which is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/404084.xml">
Hebb's rule</link>, which is usually stated in biological terms as </p>
<p>

<it>Neurons that fire together, wire together.</it></p>
<p>

Computationally, this means that if a large signal from one of the input neurons results in a large signal from one of the output neurons, then the synaptic weight between those two neurons will increase. The rule is unstable, however, and is typically modified using such variations as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../564/9617564.xml">
Oja's rule</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../753/2310753.xml">
radial basis functions</link> or the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../091/1360091.xml">
backpropagation</link> algorithm.</p>

For biological networks, the effect of synaptic weights is not as simple as for linear neurons or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/404084.xml">
Hebbian learning</link>. However, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../000/54000.xml">
biophysical</link> models such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/14200011.xml">
BCM theory</link> have seen some success in mathematically describing these networks.</p>
<p>

In the mammalian <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/7251.xml">
central nervous system</link>, signal transmission is carried out by interconnected networks of nerve cells, or neurons. For the basic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/627937.xml">
pyramidal neuron</link>, the input signal is carried by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/958.xml">
axon</link>, which releases neurotransmitter chemicals into the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../809/27809.xml">
synapse</link> which is picked up by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../131/8131.xml">
dendrites</link> of the next neuron, which can then generate an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../998/156998.xml">
action potential</link> which is analogous to the output signal in the computational case.</p>
<p>

The synaptic weight in this process is determined by several variable factors:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 How well the input signal propagates through the axon (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../319/19319.xml">
myelination</link>),</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The amount of neurotransmitter released into the synapse and the amount that can be absorbed in the following cell (determined by the number of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/522632.xml">
AMDA</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/374325.xml">
NMDA</link> receptors on the cell membrane and the amount of intracellular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/5668.xml">
calcium</link> and other ions),</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The number of such connections made by the axon to the dendrites,</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 How well the signal propagates and <link>
integrates</link> in the postsynaptic cell.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The changes in synaptic weight that occur is known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../771/423771.xml">
synaptic plasticity</link>, and the process behind long-term changes (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/372266.xml">
long-term potentiation</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/487921.xml">
depression</link>) is still poorly understood. Hebb's original learning rule was originally applied to biological systems, but has had to undergo many modifications as a number of theoretical and experimental problems came to light.</p>
