computer programming</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/12432.xml">
genius</link> working for the L. Dullo computer company. He was banished to the "sub-sub-basement" by his boss, Leo Dullo. By day Marlo works for L. Dullo. At night he builds, programs, and interacts with his Magic Movie Machine (<link>
Mert Koplin</link>, voice) built using L. Dullo hardware. Wavy lines appeared on the Magic Movie Machine's screen whenever it talked and it played short clips. The two (man and computer) traded tips and quips.</p>
<p>

Marlo would call up the various film clips featured on the show by entering codes using a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../829/451829.xml">
numeric keypad</link> with round, yellow number buttons and pressing an orange rectangular Start button to start the selected film.  In earlier episodes, an analog display would show the code entered on the keypad.  In later episodes, this was changed to an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/18290.xml">
LED</link> display, and the buttons were made to sound like the tones made by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/8488.xml">
touch-tone</link> telephone as Marlo pressed them.  Most of the time, Marlo used a small keypad, located in front of him when he was sitting at the console of the Magic Movie Machine.  However, a larger keypad located on the wall was sometimes used (see below).</p>

Segments</st>

<p>

Regularly featured segments, in the form of films played by the Machine, included:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>The Pre-fame Game</b> - Marlo always used the code '5060' to call up this film.  Baby pictures of famous people would be shown and you would be given a chance to guess who they are before a more current picture is revealed.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>The Birthday Game</b> - A date would be chosen, possibly from letters sent in by fans having that birthday.  Marlo would enter this month and day on the keypad.  A film featuring famous people who shared that birthday would be shown.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>What do you see from A to Z</b> - The code for this feature was '456.'  A letter of the alphabet would be chosen, and film clips of things beginning with that letter would be shown.  The clip would begin shown completely covered up, and gradually uncovered until it is completely revealed after 10 seconds.  Presumably, the audience would try to identify what is being shown as quickly as possible.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>What do you see from A to Z Hidden Word Game</b> - The code was '4560.'  Similar to above, except that each word would begin with a different letter, and after the picture is uncovered, its initial letter would be placed in a blank in a final word.  At the end of the segment, the final word would be completely filled in.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Magic Year, Magic Month, and Magic Day</b> Using a chosen date or year as the code and utilizing a special keypad added in a later season to enter months, Marlo and the machine would feature events in history occurring on a particular day (the same day in different years) or in a particular month or year.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Knock-knock Jokes</b> - Marlo would use the larger keypad to enter the code '0000' to call up this film.  A character on-screen would begin by saying "knock-knock," Marlo would answer "Who's There," and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../988/16988.xml">
knock-knock joke</link> would be told.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Riddles</b> - In a later season, the Knock-knock jokes were replaced by riddles, which Marlo would call up, again using the bigger keypad, by pressing '2222.'</entry>
