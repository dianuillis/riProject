 History </st>
<p>

Founded as the American Documentation Institute (ADI) on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/20198.xml">
March 13</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../684/34684.xml">
1937</link>, the organization was first concerned with microfilm and its role as a vehicle for the dissemination of information.<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22fn_7%22])">
7</link>  The organization went through its first name change in January 1968.  The change was made to represent the organization’s interest in “all aspects of the information transfer process” such as, “designing, managing and using information systems and technology<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22fn_7%22])">
7</link>.  In 2000 the organization updated its name to American Society for Information Science and Technology to embrace the increase in online databases.  Today, the organization comprises professionals from various fields including engineering, linguistics, librarianship, education, chemistry, computer science and medicine.  The members share a “common interest in improving the ways society stores, retrieves, analyzes, manages, archives and disseminates information.<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22fn_7%22])">
7</link>  The organization began publishing its journal, The Journal of the American Society for Information Science, in 1950 and has continued through to the present.<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22fn_9%22])">

 Membership </st>
<p>

Upon its conception ASIST’s membership was constructed of representatives of scientific and professional societies, foundations, and government agencies. (history)  Changes made to the bylaws in 1952 opened the organization to any individual with interest in the dissemination of information.  Today, memberships are fee-based and can be individual or institutional.  There are no specific professional requirements to join as an individual.  Similar to most organizations of its kind, ASIST offers as basic membership benefits a subscription to the Society Bulletin; access to their job assistance services (JobLine); a subscription to JASIST, the Society Journal; discounts to ASIST-sponsored events; and the ability to participate in the ASIST SIG system and participation in the election of Society officials.</p>
