In addition to the academic curriculum, the Accelerated Scholars also receive formal leadership instruction through a number of sources which include college level classroom instruction, supervised leadership practical exercises, confidence and team building activities, and everyday opportunities to place learned leadership skills into practice with their peers.</p>
