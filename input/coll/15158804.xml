Scientists have gathered an enormous volume of information on biological evolution, and there are problems in management of that information similar to those in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/4214.xml">
bioinformatics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/55170.xml">
genomics</link>. Indeed, bioinformatics and genomics are pertinent to the study of evolution, and utilization of information from those areas is of concern in evolutionary informatics.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

In 2006,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> the <link>

,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> funded the NESCent Evolutionary Informatics Working Group and conference series:</p>
<p>

Though evolutionary biologists have developed powerful tools for inferring phylogenies, detecting selection, and so on, integrating evolutionary methodology into workflows in bioinformatics does not depend so much on the power of analysis tools as it does on a well developed informatics infrastructure: software and standards for data exchange, visualization, input-and-output, editing, control, and storage-and-retrieval. We propose a working group to facilitate (directly and indirectly) the development of this infrastructure. Through a series of four meetings, each with presentations, discussion, and actual software development, the working group will build on the foundation provided by current analysis tools and available standards.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The working group has filed its first (June 2007)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> and second (December 2007)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> reports to NESCent.</p>

<p>

The notion that information processing is essential to life and to evolution predates the entry of the term <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../625/4964625.xml">
informatics</link> into the English language (1966).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Various investigators argued in the 1940's that certain principles of information processing apply both in living and engineered systems, and much of their thinking is encapsulated in <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/63185.xml">
Norbert Wiener</link></scientist>
</person>
's <it>Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</it> (1948).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> Wiener regarded evolution as <it>phylogenetic learning,</it> or accrual of information in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../388/12388.xml">
genome</link>. It should be noted that while <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/5904.xml">
cybernetics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/3929318.xml">
biocybernetics</link> address information, they place an emphasis on principles of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/11545.xml">
feedback</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../473/275473.xml">
control</link> that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../625/4964625.xml">
informatics</link> does not.</p>
<p>

Relatively recent work has focused on evolution as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../033/52033.xml">
optimization</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/412285.xml">
fitness function</link>s, and has addressed the role of information in optimization. Beginning with a 1995 technical report<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> and continuing with a 1997 article, "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Wolpert and Macready established that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../837/190837.xml">
evolutionary algorithm</link>s have average performance no better than that of random search. They argued that superior performance could be achieved only if <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>s incorporate prior knowledge of problems, and provided an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/487312.xml">
information-geometric</link> analysis of how algorithms and problems are matched (and mismatched).</p>
<p>

English argued in 1996 that there was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../704/144704.xml">
no free lunch</link> due to an underlying "conservation of information,"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> and pursued the notion further in 1999.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> In that work, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../956/6956.xml">
conservation</link> was characterized in terms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/15445.xml">
Shannon information</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../282/427282.xml">
mutual information</link>. In 2000, English turned to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/1635.xml">
Kolmogorov complexity</link> as a measure of information in instances of fitness functions and optimization algorithms. He observed that almost all problems exhibit a high degree of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/1635.xml">
Kolmogorov randomness</link>, and thus are easy for almost all optimization algorithms.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> In 2004, English gave a new perspective on conservation by way of characterizing approximate satisfaction of a necessary and sufficient condition for "no free lunch."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

Wolpert and Macready proved the existence of coevolutionary "free lunches" in 2005.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> This may be interpreted as the discovery of a problem class for which some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../835/190835.xml">
coevolutionary</link> algorithms are generally better informed than others of how to solve problems.</p>

Evolutionary informatics merges theories of evolution and information, thereby wedding the natural, engineering, and mathematical sciences. Evolutionary informatics studies how evolving systems incorporate, transform, and export information.</p>
<p>

This may be compared to a statement by the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 School of Informatics: </p>
<p>

Informatics studies the representation, processing, and communication of information in natural and engineered systems. [...] The central notion is the transformation of information - whether by computation or communication, whether by organisms or artifacts. [...] Computational systems, whether natural or engineered, are distinguished by their great complexity, as regards both their internal structure and behaviour, and their rich interaction with the environment. Informatics seeks to understand and to construct (or reconstruct) such systems, using analytic, experimental and engineering methodologies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

As of January 2008, three unpublished technical papers by Marks and Dembski are available at the Evolutionary Informatics Laboratory's website, and none refers explicitly to evolutionary informatics.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
