With the passage of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../372/6151372.xml">
Balanced Budget Act of 1997</link>, Medicare beneficiaries were given the option to receive their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">
Medicare</link> benefits through private <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">
health insurance</link> plans, instead of through the Original Medicare plan (Parts A and B). These programs were known as Medicare+Choice or Part C plans.  <p>

Pursuant to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/378922.xml">
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act</link> of 2003, the compensation and business practices changed for insurers that offer these plans, and "Medicare+Choice" plans became known as "Medicare Advantage" (MA) plans.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Overview</st>
<p>

Medicare has a standard benefit package that covers medically necessary care members can receive from nearly any hospital or doctor in the country. For people who choose to enroll in a Medicare private health plan, Medicare pays the private health plan a set amount every month for each member. Members may have to pay a monthly premium in addition to the Medicare Part B premium and generally pay a fixed amount (a copayment of $20, for example) every time they see a doctor. The copayment can be higher to see a specialist. </p>
<p>

The private plans are required to offer a benefit “package” that is at least as good as Medicare’s and cover everything Medicare covers, but they do not have to cover every benefit in the same way. Plans that pay less than Medicare for some benefits, like skilled nursing facility care, can balance their benefits package by offering lower copayments for doctor visits. Private plans use some of the excess payments they receive from the government for each enrollee to offer supplemental benefits. Some plans put a limit on their members’ annual out-of-pocket spending on medical care, providing some insurance against catastrophic costs over $5,000, for example. But many plans use the excess subsidies to offer dental coverage and other services not covered by Medicare and can leave members exposed to high medical bills if they fall seriously ill. Private plan members can end up with unexpectedly high out-of-pocket costs. </p>
<p>

In 2006 enrollees in Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service plans were offered a net extra benefit value (the value of the additional benefits minus any additional premium) of $55.92 a month more than the traditional Medicare benefit package; enrollees in other Medicare Advantage plans were offered a net extra benefit value of $71.22 a month more.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Medicare Advantage Plans that also include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../773/2870773.xml">
Part D</link> prescription drug benefits are known as a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan or a MAPD.</p>
<p>

Enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans grew from 5.4 million in 2005 to 8.2 million in 2007.  Enrollment grew by an additional 800,000 during the first four months of 2008.  This represents 19% of Medicare beneficiaries.  A third of beneficiaries with Part D coverage are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.  Medicare Advantage enrollment is higher in urban areas; the enrollment rate in urban counties is twice that in rural counties (22% vs. 10%).  Almost all Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least two Medicare Advantage plans; most have access to three or more.  The number of organizations offering Fee-for-Service plans has increased dramatically, from 11 in 2006 to almost 50 in 2008.  Eight out of ten beneficiaries (82%) now have access to six or more Private Fee-for-Service plans.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
