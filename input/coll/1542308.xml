Plot Summary</st>

<p>

The novel is divided into four sections. Each detail a particular day in the four months that spanned the summer of 1958.</p>
<p>

<it>In June</it>: This section takes up half of the book and shows the narrator meeting up with various teenaged friends and some adults in various parts of London and discussing his outlook on life and the new concept of being a teenager. He also learns that his ex-girlfriend, Suzette, is to enter a marriage of convenience with her boss, a middle-aged gay fashion designer called Henley.  </p>

<it>In September</it> is set on the narrator's nineteenth birthday. He sees this, symbolically, as the beginning of his last year as a teenager. He witnesses several incidents of racial violence, which disgust him. His father also dies, leaving him four envelopes stuffed with money. Suzette has separated from Henley, but still seems uncertain as to whether she should resume her relationship with the narrator. The narrator decides to leave the country and find a place where racism doesn't exist. At the airport, he sees Africans arriving and gives them a warm welcome.</p>

Although MacInnes turned forty-four in the summer of 1958, the book is written through the eyes of an eighteen-year-old, who is part of the new vibrant and affluent London youth culture of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../815/370815.xml">
coffee bar</link>s, Modern Jazz and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/25412.xml">

mod</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../349/150349.xml">
subculture</link> in the 1960s. MacInnes has the narrator use a very stylised form of speech. For example, when the narrator and Zesty-Boy talk  about why Vendice no longer uses Dido's newspaper for advertising, MacInnes writes it as:</p>
<p>

'And why has Partner's pimpery taken their custom away from Dido's toilet-paper daily?' I asked Zesty-Boy.
'It may be that Dido's slipping, or the paper's slipping, or just that everything these days is falling in the fat laps of the jingle kings.'
'I wonder why Dido doesn't do a quick change and crash land in the telly casbah?'</p>

<p>

The narrator is never given a name. When asked it by a girl at a party, he avoids the question. When pressed, he says, sarcastically, <fictional_character wordnetid="109587565" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/4786098.xml">

</fictional_character>
. He is variously addressed in the book as "blitz baby", "kid", "teenager", "child", "infant prodigy" and "son": all terms that emphasize his youth. The majority of the other characters are given nicknames or referred to by their job titles, rather than by their real names.</p>
