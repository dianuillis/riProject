A <b>digital signal processor</b> (<b>DSP</b> or <b>DSP micro</b>) is a specialized <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/19553.xml">

Typical characteristics</st>

<p>

Digital signal processing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>s typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly on a set of data.  Signals are converted from analog to digital, manipulated digitally, and then converted again to analog form, as diagrammed below.  Many DSP applications have constraints on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/17933.xml">
latency</link>; that is, for the system to work, the DSP operation must be completed within some time constraint.</p>

Most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute DSP algorithms successfully. But these microprocessors are not suitable for application of mobile telephone and pocket PDA systems etc. because of power supply and space limit. A specialized digital signal processor, however, will tend to provide a lower-cost solution, with better performance and lower latency.</p>
<p>

The architecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing work.  Some useful features for optimizing DSP algorithms are outlined below.</p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../753/34753.xml">
1978</link>, Intel released the 2920 as an "analog signal processor". It had an on-chip ADC/DAC with an internal signal processor, but it didn't have a hardware multiplier and was not successful in the market. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/34754.xml">

 presented in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/34755.xml">
1983</link>, proved to be an even bigger success. It was based on the Harvard architecture, and so had separate instruction and data memory. It already had a special instruction set, with instructions like load-and-accumulate or multiply-and-accumulate. It could work on 16-bit numbers and needed 390ns for a multiply-add operation. TI is now the market leader in general-purpose DSPs. Another successful design was the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

.</p>
<p>

About five years later, the second generation of DSPs began to spread. They had 3 memories for storing two operands simultaneously and included hardware to accelerate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/45273.xml">
tight loop</link>s, they also had an addressing unit capable of <link>
loop-addressing</link>. Some of them operated on 24-bit variables and a typical model only required about 21ns for a MAC (multiply-accumulate). Members of this generation were for example the AT&amp;T DSP16A or the Motorola DSP56001.</p>
<p>

The main improvement in the third generation was the appearance of application-specific units and instructions in the data path, or sometimes as coprocessors. These units allowed direct hardware acceleration of very specific but complex mathematical problems, like the Fourier-transform or matrix operations. Some chips, like the Motorola MC68356, even included more than one processor core to work in parallel. Other DSPs from 1995 are the TI TMS320C541 or the TMS 320C80. </p>
<p>

The fourth generation is best characterized by the changes in the instruction set and the instruction encoding/decoding. SIMD and MMX extensions were added, VLIW and the superscalar architecture appeared. As always, the clock-speeds have increased, a 3ns MAC now became possible.</p>

Modern DSPs</st>

<p>

Modern signal processors yield much greater performance. This is due in part to both technological and architectural advancements like lower design rules, fast-access two-level cache, (E)<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../717/57717.xml">
DMA</link> circuit and a wider bus system. Of course, not all DSPs provide the same speed and many kinds of signal processors exist, each one of them being better suited for a specific task, ranging in price from about US$1.50 to US$300. A Texas Instruments <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../355/2542355.xml">
C6000</link> series DSP clocks at 1.2 GHz and implements separate instruction and data caches as well as an 8 MiB 2nd level cache, and its I/O speed is rapid thanks to its 64 EDMA channels. The top models are capable of as many as 8000 MIPS (million <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../684/20684.xml">
instructions per second</link>), use VLIW (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../706/51706.xml">
very long instruction word</link>) encoding, perform eight operations per clock-cycle and are compatible with a broad range of external peripherals and various buses (PCI/serial/etc).</p>
<p>

Another player at the high-end signal processor manufacturer today is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/486512.xml">
Freescale</link>. The company provides a multi-core DSPs family MSC81xx. The MSC81xx is based on StarCore™ Architecture processors. The latest MSC8144 DSP combines four programmable SC3400 StarCore™ DSP cores. Each SC3400 StarCore™ DSP core runs at 1GHz. The SC3400 performed higher than any other programmable DSP at 1 GHz on BDTIsimMark2000™  results published by Berkeley Design Technology, Inc. (BDTI).</p>

 family of embedded digital signal processors, with models like the ADSP-BF531 to ADSP-BF536. These processors combine the features of a DSP with those of a general use processor. As a result, these processors can run simple <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../339/903339.xml">

 while operating relatively efficiently on real-time data.</p>
<p>

Most DSPs use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../736/449736.xml">
fixed-point arithmetic</link>, because in real world signal processing, the additional range provided by floating point is not needed, and there is a large speed benefit and cost benefit due to reduced hardware complexity. Floating point DSPs may be invaluable in applications where a wide dynamic range is required. Product developers might also use floating point DSPs to reduce the cost and complexity of software development in exchange for more expensive hardware, since it is generally easier to implement algorithms in floating point.</p>
<p>

Generally, DSPs are dedicated integrated circuits, however DSP functionality can also be realized using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../814/592814.xml">
Field Programmable Gate Array</link> chips.</p>
<p>

Embedded general-purpose RISC processors are becoming increasingly DSP in functionality. For example, ARM Cortex-A8 has a 128-bit wide SIMD unit that can have impressive 16- and 8-bit performance for industry standard benchmarks.</p>
