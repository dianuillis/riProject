 History </st>

<p>

Founded in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../760/34760.xml">
1987</link> by <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 and Ken Morris, PeopleSoft was originally headquartered in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/107424.xml">

 before moving to  <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../340/107340.xml">
Pleasanton, California</link></village>
. PeopleSoft began with an idea Duffield had about a "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/6513.xml">
Client-Server</link>" version of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../051/8394051.xml">
Integral Systems</link></company>
 popular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/20266.xml">
mainframe</link> HRMS package.  Once Integral declined development, Duffield was released to pursue this endeavor on his own, and PeopleSoft was born.  In 2003, when the company acquired <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/252911.xml">
J.D. Edwards</link>, it decided to differentiate its former product line with those of Edwards by renaming both products.  In January <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/35984.xml">
2005</link>, PeopleSoft was acquired by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/22591.xml">
Oracle Corporation</link></company>
.  PeopleSoft products continue to be used.</p>

 Product design </st>

<p>

PeopleSoft's product suite (also called PeopleSoft) was initially based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/6513.xml">
Client-Server</link> architecture. The entire software suite moved to a <invention wordnetid="105633385" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/33139.xml">
web</link></invention>
-centric design called Pure Internet Architecture (PIA) with the release of PeopleSoft Version 8.  The new format allowed all of a company's business functions to be accessed and run on a web client.  Originally, a small number of security and system setup functions still needed to be performed on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../586/273586.xml">
fat client</link> machine, however, this is no longer the case. The inherent nature of Internet-based applications allowed for a straightforward transition from a client-server model .  One important feature of PeopleSoft's PIA is that no code is required on the client - there is no need for additional downloads of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../659/23659.xml">
plugins</link>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/16389.xml">
JVM</link>s such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../607/7207607.xml">
Jinitiator</link> required for Oracle Applications.</p>
<p>

The architecture is built around PeopleSoft’s proprietary <environment wordnetid="113934596" confidence="0.8">

 technology. (development platform similar to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/11367.xml">
4GL</link>) PeopleTools includes many different components a developer needs to create an application, including a scripting language called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/5157513.xml">
PeopleCode</link>, design tools to define various types of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/18933632.xml">
metadata</link>, standard security structure, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/37285.xml">
batch processing</link> tools.  The metadata describes data for user interfaces, tables, messages, security, navigation, portals, and so forth.  The benefit of creating their own development platform allowed PeopleSoft applications to run on top of many different operating systems and database platforms.  Currently, it is not tied to any specific database platform. PeopleSoft implementations exist or have existed on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../725/323725.xml">

All of PeopleSoft’s modules (Human Resources, Supply Chain, Financials, CRM, etc.) are built with the PeopleTools technology.   A benefit of the technology is that all the code which makes up a module can be customized to suit a company’s business needs.

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/36163.xml">
2003</link>, PeopleSoft performed a friendly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../769/20769.xml">
merger</link> with smaller rival <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/252911.xml">
J.D. Edwards</link>.  The former rival's similar product line was differentiated by its target audience: mid-sized companies who could not afford the original PeopleSoft applications. J.D. Edwards product lines, formerly J.D. Edwards <it>World</it> on the AS/400 and OneWorld, were and continue to be differentiated by the Configurable Network Architecture or <it>CNC</it> Architecture. This architecture is designed to shield applications from both the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> and the database backend as long as some flavor of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../004/29004.xml">

Beginning in 2003, PeopleSoft battled with <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/22591.xml">

 over control of the PeopleSoft company.  In June 2003, Oracle made a $7 billion bid ($19.50/share) in a hostile corporate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../119/56119.xml">
takeover</link> attempt.  In February 2004, Oracle increased their bid to approximately $9.4 billion ($26/share), a 33% increase; this offer was also rejected forthwith by PeopleSoft's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../822/4822.xml">
board of directors</link>.  Later that month, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../563/52563.xml">
U.S. Department of Justice</link> filed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/113258.xml">
suit</link> to block Oracle, on the grounds that the acquisition would break <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/666256.xml">
anti-trust</link> laws; however, in September 2004, the suit was rejected by a <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

.  Though Oracle had reduced its offer to $7.7 billion ($21/share) in May, it again raised its bid in November to $9.4 billion ($24/share), marking a 14% increase. </p>
<p>

In December 2004, Oracle announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire PeopleSoft for approximately $10.3 billion ($26.50/share).  In January 2005, Oracle made drastic cuts in the PeopleSoft ranks.  These cuts affected approximately 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies, but Oracle maintained at least 90% of PeopleSoft's product development and support staff.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Oracle moved to capitalize on the perceived strong brand loyalty within the JD Edwards user community by rebranding former JD Edwards products. Thus <b>PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne</b> became <b>JD Edwards EnterpriseOne</b> and <b>PeopleSoft World</b> became <b>JD Edwards World</b>.</p>
<p>

Oracle has announced that a new product <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/4649749.xml">
Fusion</link> is to be released in the near future.  Oracle says Fusion will take the best aspects of the PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and Oracle Applications and merge them into a new product suite.  </p>
<p>

Oracle continues to support the existing Oracle and PeopleSoft product lines for current users.  By retaining current applications and supporting the move to Fusion when appropriate, Oracle may be attempting prevent customer defections to rival <link>
Enterprise Resource Planning</link> vendors.</p>

PeopleSoft projects have been successfully implemented by many users, though there have been instances of litigation. As with any ERP software, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../704/407704.xml">
implementation</link> process (including analysis, planning and development), performance (load) testing and various other types of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/29090.xml">
