Family Medicine Residency</st>
<p>

At Excela Health Latrobe Hospital a dually accredited (ACGME and AOA) unopposed Family Medicine Residency program exists. The program was founded in 1974 in response to a community need for family physicians. Each class graduates a total of 6 physicians. A Benefit of the program include subsidized housing across the street from the hospital. One unique feature of the program are during the entirety of a resident's training, they are assigned to one of three community health centers, each staffed with two residents from each class, and at least three family medicine faculty. This ensures excellent continuity of care and it gives residents "real office" experience so they are prepared for any type of practice that they may choose to enter following graduation.</p>
