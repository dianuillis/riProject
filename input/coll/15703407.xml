A Board of Commissioners governs the State Bar. The minimum number of Commissioners on the Board is 31, and the maximum number is 33. The Board of Commissioners has several standing committees which provide oversight to the operations of the Bar in strategic planning, finance, public policy, member services and other matters. The Bar's elected officers include a President, President-Elect, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. A 10-member Executive Committee composed of the officers, a Representative Assembly Chair and Vice-Chair, and three other commissioners chosen by the President manage the affairs of the Bar between board meetings. A 150-member Representative Assembly is the final policymaking body of the State Bar. Currently, the Bar has more than 39,000 members.</p>
