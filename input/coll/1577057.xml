Supreme Court of Colorado</link> (see 187 P.2d 926, 928). Mr. Wolf appealed the conviction by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../489/158489.xml">
writ of certiorari</link>, which the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/31737.xml">

Frankfurter's opinion for the majority</st>
<p>

In its 6-to-3 decision, the Court upheld the decision of the lower courts. It stated that although exclusion of evidence is indeed an effective way of discouraging and preventing unreasonable searches, there exist other methods that can achieve the same effect while complying with the minimal standards set by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/40359.xml">
Due Process Clause</link>. As an example, the Court suggested civil remedies, such as “the internal discipline of the police, under the eyes of an alert public opinion.”</p>

 does not impose similar limitations upon states. He cites the notion that due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is shorthand for the first eight amendments of the Constitution, and flatly rejects it, commenting that “the issue is closed.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

In considering the restrictions which the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/40359.xml">
Due Process Clause</link> imposes upon states in regards to enforcement of criminal law, the Court does not stray far from the views expressed in <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/1577711.xml">
Palko v. Connecticut</link></it>, <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=302&amp;page=319">
302 U.S.  319</weblink> (1937). In that decision, Associate Justice <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<judge wordnetid="110225219" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../837/594837.xml">
Benjamin N. Cardozo</link></judge>
</person>
 rejected the notion that the Due Process Clause incorporates the original <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../082/43082.xml">
Bill of Rights</link>.</p>
<p>

In addition to this rationale, the court stated that the fourteenth amendment does not specifically prohibit the use of illegally obtained evidence from being presented in the court of law.</p>
<p>

Frankfurter writes that the security of an individual’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police is basic to a free society. Thus, it is implicit in “the concept of ordered liberty” and, therefore, is enforceable against states through the Due Process Clause. Accordingly, if a state were to affirmatively sanction such police action, it would violate the guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, enforcement of this basic right raises further questions, e.g., how to check such police conduct, what remedies are appropriate against it, and so forth. </p>
<p>

The important precedent relevant in this case arises from <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../237/1580237.xml">
Weeks v. United States</link></it>, (1914).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> The main consequence of the unanimous ruling in <it>Weeks</it> was that in a <it>federal</it> prosecution, the Fourth Amendment prohibited the use of evidence obtained by an illegal search and seizure. Frankfurter notes, with apparent disapproval, that this 1914 ruling “was not derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment,” nor “based on legislation expressing Congressional policy in the enforcement of the Constitution.” However, because the rule has been frequently applied since, “we stoutly adhere to it.”</p>
<p>

However, Frankfurter reaffirms, the immediate question at hand is whether this basic right to protection against arbitrary intrusion by the police in a federal case extends to state cases as well. He writes that because most of the English-speaking world “does not regard as vital … the exclusion of evidence such obtained,” the Court must hesitate “to treat this remedy as an essential ingredient of the right.”</p>
<p>

Frankfurter writes that although the practice of exclusion of evidence is indeed an efficient way of deterring unlawful searches, the Court cannot condemn other equally effective methods as falling below the minimal standards required by the Due Process Clause. Further, there exist reasons for excluding evidence obtained by the federal police that are less compelling in the case of state or local authority.</p>
<p>

He concludes that because of the above reasons, the Court holds that “in a prosecution in a State Court for a State crime, the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../687/572687.xml">
search and seizure</link>.”</p>

<st>
Black's concurrence</st>
<p>

In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../063/150063.xml">
Hugo L. Black</link> notes that as per his previous dissents, he agrees that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizure is enforceable against the states.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> He writes that he would be in favor of the reversal of the decision of the lower courts if he thought that the Fourth Amendment, by itself, barred not only unreasonable searches and seizures, but also the use of evidence so obtained. However, he agrees with the implication evident from the Court’s opinion in that the federal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/1504970.xml">
exclusionary rule</link> is “not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> He concludes that this implication leads him “to concur in the Court’s judgment of affirmance.”</p>

Douglas' dissent</st>
<p>

Associate Justice <judge wordnetid="110225219" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/365245.xml">
William O. Douglas</link></judge>
 writes in his dissenting opinion that for the reasons stated by Justice <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../063/150063.xml">
Hugo L. Black</link> in his dissent in <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../336/1577336.xml">
Adamson v. California</link></it>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> he believes that the Fourth Amendment is applicable to the States. He agrees with Justice Frank Murphy’s assertion that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded in state as well as in federal prosecutions; in absence of such exclusion, “the Amendment would have no effective sanction.”</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Murphy's dissent</st>
<p>

In his dissent opinion, with which Justice <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../788/747788.xml">
Wiley B. Rutledge</link> concurs, Associate Justice <judge wordnetid="110225219" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/507293.xml">
Frank Murphy</link></judge>
 takes issue with the majority opinion’s suggestion that there exist alternatives to the exclusionary rule. He complains that this very statement “conveys the impression that one possibility is as effective as the next,” while, in his opinion, there is only one alternative to the rule of exclusion – and that is “no sanction at all.”</p>
<p>

Murphy openly questions the Court’s suggestion of self-regulation, scoffing at the notion of expecting “a District Attorney to prosecute himself…for well-meaning violations of the search and seizure clause during a raid the District Attorney…[has] ordered.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Murphy suggests another alternative, somewhat parenthetically, whereas a trespass action for damages could be used as “a venerable means of securing reparation for unauthorized invasion of the home.”</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Rutledge's dissent</st>
<p>

Associate Justice <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../788/747788.xml">
Wiley B. Rutledge</link> writes a dissenting opinion, with which Justice <judge wordnetid="110225219" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/507293.xml">
Frank Murphy</link></judge>
 concurs. He rejects the Court’s conclusion that the mandate of the Fourth Amendment, though binding on the states, does not carry with it the sanction of the exclusionary rule. He agrees with Justice Murphy’s assertion that the “Amendment without the sanction is a dead letter.”</p>
<p>

He also rejects the Court’s suggestion that Congress could genuinely enact legislation that would permit the use in federal courts of evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, noting that this issue had previously – and negatively – been settled in <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/19511859.xml">
Boyd v. United States</link></it>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Justice Rutledge concludes by saying that the Court makes “the illegality of this search and seizure its inarticulate premise of decision.” He concurs with this premise, and believes that the conviction should be reversed.</p>

Justice Frankfurter notes that the equation of the Fourteenth Amendment with the first eight amendments has been rejected by the Court numerous times, “after impressive consideration.” For earlier cases involving this consideration, see <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../909/8211909.xml">

Justice Murphy cites Pound, <it>Criminal Justice in America</it> (New York, 1930) to support his argument: “Under our legal system the way of the prosecutor is hard, and the need of 'getting results' puts pressure upon prosecutors to indulge in that lawless enforcement of law which produces a vicious circle of disrespect for law.”</entry>

In explaining his reasoning, Justice Rutledge writes, “I had thought that issue settled by this Court's invalidation on dual grounds, in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 , of a federal statute which in effect required the production of evidence thought probative by Government counsel – the Court there holding the statute to be 'obnoxious to the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, as well as of the Fifth.' Id., at page 632, 6 S.Ct. at page 533. See <it><link>
Adams v. New York</link></it>, 192 U.S. 585, 597 , 598, 375. The view that the Fourth Amendment itself forbids the introduction of evidence illegally obtained in federal prosecutions is one of long standing and firmly established. See <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/2096677.xml">
Olmstead v. United States</link></it>, 277 U.S. 438, 462 , 567, 66 A.L.R. 376. It is too late in my judgment to question it now. We apply it today in <it><link>
Lustig v. United States</link></it>, 338 U.S. 74.”</entry>
