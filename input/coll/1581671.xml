A <b>healthy diet</b> is one that is arrived at with the intent of improving or maintaining optimal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../381/80381.xml">
health</link>. </p>
<p>

This usually involves consuming <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../575/66575.xml">
nutrients</link> by eating the appropriate amounts from all of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../473/2953473.xml">
food groups</link>, including an adequate amount of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>. Since <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/682482.xml">
human</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/21525.xml">
nutrition</link> is complex, a healthy diet may vary widely, and is subject to an individual's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../796/12796.xml">
genetic makeup</link>, environment, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../381/80381.xml">
health</link>. For around 20% of the human population, lack of food and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/258979.xml">
malnutrition</link> are the main impediments to healthy eating. Conversely, people in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../255/78255.xml">
developed countries</link> have the opposite problem; they are more concerned about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">
obesity</link>.</p>

Generally, a healthy diet is said to include:

 Detrimental eating habits </st>
<p>

In specific individuals, ingesting foods containing natural <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/58859.xml">
allergens</link> (e.g. peanuts, shellfood) or drug-induced triggers (e.g. tyramine for a person taking an MAO inhibitor) may be life-threatening.</p>
<p>

Some foods have low nutritional value, and if consumed on a regular basis will contribute to the decline of human health. This has been demonstrated by various epidemiological studies that have determined that foods such as processed and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/360101.xml">
fast food</link>s are linked to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/44677.xml">
diabetes</link> and various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../808/36808.xml">
heart</link> problems. </p>
<p>

When improperly cut or prepared, a small number of foods (such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../945/476945.xml">
fugu</link>) can result in death. </p>
<p>

The ingredient usually cited as being most crucial to good health, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>, has even been known to result in death when consumed in <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

 Cultural and psychological factors </st>
<p>

From a psychological perspective, a new healthy diet may be difficult to achieve for a person with poor eating habits. This may be due to tastes acquired in early adolescence and preferences for fatty foods. It may be easier for such a person to transition to a healthy diet if treats such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../089/7089.xml">
chocolate</link> are allowed; sweets may act as mood stabilizers, which could help reinforce correct nutrient intake. </p>
<p>

It is known that the experiences we have in childhood relating to consumption of food affect our perspective on food consumption in later life. From this, we are able to determine ourselves our limits of how much we will eat, as well as foods we will not eat - which can develop into eating disorders, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/37193.xml">
anorexia</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../536/168536.xml">
 bulimia</link>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/228214.xml">
orthorexia</link> This is also true with how we perceive the sizes of the meals or amounts of food we consume daily; people have different interpretations of small and large meals based on upbringing.</p>
<p>

While plants, vegetables, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../843/10843.xml">
fruits</link> are known to help reduce the incidence of chronic disease, the benefits on health posed by plant-based foods, as well as the percentage of which a diet needs to be plant based in order to have health benefits is unknown. Nevertheless, plant-based food diets in society and between nutritionist circles are linked to health and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/196206.xml">
longevity</link>, as well as contributing to lowering cholesterol, weight loss, and in some cases, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/146072.xml">
stress</link> reduction.  </p>
<p>

Indeed, ideas of what counts as "healthy eating" have varied in different times and places, according to scientific advances in the field of nutrition, cultural fashions, religious proscriptions, or personal considerations.</p>

 Public policy issues </st>
<p>

Fears of high cholesterol were frequently voiced up until the mid-1990s. However, more recent research has shown that the distinction between high- and low-density <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/92512.xml">
lipoprotein</link> ('good' and 'bad' cholesterol, respectively) must be addressed when speaking of the potential ill effects of cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein is often prevalent in animal products, such as bacon and egg yolks, whereas high-density lipoprotein is more common in plant and fish tissues, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/36984.xml">
salmon</link>.</p>
<p>

Media coverage of mass-produced, processed, "snack" or "sweet" products directly marketed at children has worked to undermine policy efforts to improve eating habits.  The main problem with such advertisements for foods is that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../014/1014.xml">
alcohol</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/360101.xml">
fast food</link> are portrayed as offering excitement, escape and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/2733733.xml">
instant gratification</link>. </p>
<p>

Particularly within the last five years government agencies have attempted to combat the amount and method of media coverage lavished upon "junk" foods. Governments also put pressure on businesses to promote healthy food options, consider limiting the availability of junk food in state-run schools, and tax foods that are high in fat. Most recently, the United Kingdom removed the rights for <series wordnetid="108457976" confidence="0.8">

Some claim that food additives, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../880/58880.xml">
artificial sweeteners</link>, colorants, preserving agents, and flavorings may cause health problems such as increasing the risk of cancer or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/64976.xml">
