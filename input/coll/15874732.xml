<b>Artificial Intelligence Marketing (AIM)</b> is still at an early stage but the widespread of high performant and affordable technologies and the advance, documentation and approachability of <link>
Artificial Intelligence</link> mean that AI is now a more plausible solution to the pursuit of the <b>one to one</b> customer relationship. There is no doubt that this is a growing area and formalisation in this type of marketing activities will occurs in the coming years. </p>
<p>

AIM is a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/665239.xml">
Direct marketing</link> leveraging <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/627628.xml">
Database marketing</link> techniques as well as AI concept and model such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/233488.xml">
Machine Learning</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../996/203996.xml">
Bayesian Network</link>. The main difference resides in the <link>
reasoning</link> part which suggests it is performed by computer and algorithm instead of human.</p>

Behavioral Targeting</st>
<p>

Artificial Intelligence Marketing provides a set of tools and techniques that enable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../552/8923552.xml">
behavioral targeting</link>. </p>

Collect, Reason, Act</st>
<p>

Artificial Intelligence Marketing principle is based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/25140.xml">
Perception</link>-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/89755.xml">
Reasoning</link>-action cycle you find in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/5626.xml">
Cognitive science</link>. In marketing context this cycle is adapted to form the <b>collect</b>, <b>reason</b> and <b>act</b> cycle.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Collect</st>
<p>

This term relates to all activities which aims at capturing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/234206.xml">
customer</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/59252.xml">
prospect</link> data. Whether taken <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../440/41440.xml">
online</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../440/41440.xml">
offline</link> these data are then saved into customer or prospect databases.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Reason</st>
<p>
 
This is the part where data is transformed into information and eventually <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/519276.xml">
intelligence</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/1466175.xml">
Insight</link>. This is the section where Artificial Intelligence and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/233488.xml">
Machine Learning</link> in particularly have a key role to play.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Act</st>
<p>

With the intelligence gathered from the <it>reason</it> step above you can then <it>act</it>. In Marketing context act would be some sort of communications that would attempt to influence a prospect or customer purchase decision using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/422023.xml">
incentive</link> driven message</p>
<p>

Again Artificial Intelligence has a role to play in this stage as well. Ultimately in an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/233497.xml">
unsupervised</link> model the machine would take the decision and act accordingly to the information it receives at the <it>collect</it> stage.</p>

Machine Learning</st>
<p>

<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/233488.xml">
Machine Learning</link> is concerned with the design and development of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>s and techniques that allow computers to "learn".</it></p>
<p>

As defined above Machine Learning is one of the techniques that can be employed to enable more effective <b>behavioral targeting</b></p>

Concerns</st>
<p>

As mentioned in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../552/8923552.xml">
behavioral targeting</link> article :</p>

<p>

<it>"Many online users &amp; advocacy groups are concerned about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/25009.xml">
privacy</link> issues around doing this type of targeting. This is an area that the behavioral targeting industry is trying to minimize through education, advocacy &amp; product constraints to keep all information non-personally identifiable or to use opt-in and permission from end-users (permission marketing)."</it></p>
