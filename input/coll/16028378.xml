The <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../391/20391.xml">
Economy of Burma</link></b> has suffered from decades of stagnation, mismanagement, and isolation. Burma’s GDP grows only 2.9% annually — the lowest rate of economic growth in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Under British administration, Burma was one of the wealthiest countries in Southeast Asia. It was once the world's largest exporter of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/36979.xml">
rice</link>. During British administration, Burma supplied <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">

. Burma also had a wealth of natural and labor resources. It produced 75% of the world's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/303469.xml">
teak</link>, and had a highly literate population. The country was believed to be on the fast track to development. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../866/761866.xml">
U Nu</link> attempted to make Burma a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/222839.xml">

 in the region. However, after the military dictatorship seized power in 1962, Burma became an isolated and impoverished nation. <p>

After the 1962 military <link>
coup d'état</link>, the military government introduced an economic plan called the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/2489971.xml">
Burmese Way to Socialism</link>, under which the military regime nationalized all industries with the exception of agriculture. In 1989, the Burmese government began decentralizing economic control. It has since liberalized certain sectors of the economy. The government heavily regulates lucrative industries, such as gems, oil, and forestry. These sectors have recently been exploited by foreign <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/7485.xml">
corporations</link>, which have partnered with the government to gain access to Burmese natural resources. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/692262.xml">

Burma was designated a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/209428.xml">

. In the eleven years from 1989 to 1999, the military government tried to revitalize the economy after three decades of tight central planning. However the regime has recently canceled its reforms. Despite this, the private sector continues to grow albeit slowly.</p>
