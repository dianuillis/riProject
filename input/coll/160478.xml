The term <b>loopback</b> (sometimes spelled 'loop-back') is generally used to describe methods or procedures of routing electronic signals, digital data streams, or other flows of items, from their originating facility quickly back to the same source entity without intentional processing or modification. This is primarily intended as a means of testing the transmission or transportation infrastructure.<p>

Examples of applications include the following:

  A method of testing between stations (not necessarily adjacent) wherein two lines are used, with the testing being done at one station and the two lines interconnected at the distant station.  Commonly called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/4436402.xml">

<p>

A loopback interface has several uses. It may be used by network client software on a computer to communicate with server software on the same computer, viz., on a computer running a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/33455.xml">
web server</link>, pointing a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/33173.xml">
web browser</link> to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/32277.xml">
URLs</link> http://127.0.0.1/ or http://localhost/  will access that computer's own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/33898.xml">
web site</link>. This works without any actual network connectionâ€“so it is useful for testing services without exposing them to security risks from remote network access. Likewise, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../265/24265.xml">
ping</link>ing the loopback interface is a basic test of the functionality of the IP stack in the operating system.</p>
<p>

Packets sent in an IP network with a source address belonging to the loopback interface can cause a number of problems for older or buggy network software. Such packets are known as <it>"<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/509688.xml">
martian packet</link>s"</it> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/martian.html">
http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/martian.html</weblink>. The Internet Protocol specification dictates that such packets must not be transmitted outside of a host, and must be dropped if received on a network interface.</p>
<p>

Loopback addresses are the subject of a reasonably common Internet <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/93090.xml">
prank</link>: directing an inexperienced user to connect to (or attack) his own loopback interface as if it were a remote server<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://bash.org/?38640">
http://bash.org/?38640</weblink>. Note, however, that contrary to popular belief, a computer will normally not crash if it "flood-pings" the loopback address. The only effect is a busy processor.</p>

Network Equipment</st>
<p>

Some network equipment uses the term <b>loopback</b> for a virtual interface used for management purposes.  Unlike a proper loopback interface, this <b>loopback</b> device is not used to talk with itself.</p>
<p>

Such an interface is assigned an address that can be accessed from management equipment over a network but is not assigned to any of the real interfaces on the device.  This loopback address is also used for management datagrams, such as alarms, originating from the equipment.  The property that makes this virtual interface special is that applications that use it will send or receive traffic using the address assigned to the virtual interface as opposed to the address on the physical interface through which the traffic passes.</p>

Serial Interface</st>
<p>

A serial communications <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/41805.xml">
transceiver</link> can use loopback for testing its functionality. For example, a device's <it>transmit</it> pin connected to its <it>receive</it> pin will result in the device receiving exactly what it transmits. Moving this looping connection to the remote end of a cable adds the cable to this test. Moving it to the far end of a modem link extends the test further. This is a common troubleshooting technique and is often combined with a specialized test device that sends specific patterns and counts any errors that come back (see <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/3123271.xml">
Bit Error Rate Test</link></it>). Some devices include built-in loopback capability.</p>

Telecommunications</st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../322/30322.xml">
telecommunications</link>, loopback, (short <b>loop</b>) is a hardware or software method which feeds a received signal or data back to the sender. It is used as an aid in debugging physical connection problems. As a test, many data communication devices can be configured to send specific patterns (such as <it>all ones</it>) on an interface, and can detect the reception of this signal on the same port. This is called a loopback test and can be performed within a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/19443900.xml">
modem</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/41805.xml">
transceiver</link> by connecting its output to its own input. A circuit between two points in different locations may be tested by applying a test signal on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../001/346001.xml">
circuit</link> in one location, and having the network device at the other location send a signal back through the circuit. If this device receives its own signal back, this proves that the circuit is functioning. </p>
<p>

A <it>hardware loop</it> is a simple device that hardwires the <it>receive</it> channel to the <it>transmit</it> channel. In the case of a network termination connector such as <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">
<protocol wordnetid="106665108" confidence="0.8">
<direction wordnetid="106786629" confidence="0.8">

X.21</link></advice>
</recommendation>
</proposal>
</rule>

</message>
, this is typically done by simply connecting the pins together in the connector. Media such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/3372377.xml">
optical fiber</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../380/46380.xml">
coaxial cable</link>, which have separate transmit and receive connectors, can simply be looped together with a single strand of the appropriate medium.</p>
<p>

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/19443900.xml">
modem</link> can be configured to loop incoming signals from either the remote modem or the local <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../792/460792.xml">
terminal</link>. This is referred to as loopback or software loop.</p>
