<b>Shaun Lawton</b> (born Sydney Shaun Lawton, 1941) an <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 playwright, poet, actor and singer/songwriter born in the iron-ore mining village of <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../759/143759.xml">
North Yorkshire</link>. In 1944 his mother took him and his sick baby sister down to friends in Brighton. On the way they were caught in V1 and V2 raids in London, which was being evacuated, and had to take shelter. When the war was over they returned home to the north. From age 10 one of his chores was to gather seacoal from the beach with his father during the hard winter months. This was a fine black coal-grit dumped on the beach by the turning tide. This generally meant very early mornings in the dark as the tide was going out, often in blizzards and bitter north-easters, before others got there first and took it all away to sell on the streets.

 and he was impressive enough to be offered a tryout for <club wordnetid="108227214" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../314/86314.xml">
goalkeeper</link>. He didn't take up the offer and because his parents were unable to finance his further education which meant he had to leave college prematurely, he instead took up a job in the petrochemical industry at Wilton ICI where he stayed for the next eleven years.
During this period, particularly the long night shifts, he began to write poetry and short stories. He also made several attempts at running the notorious Lyke Wake Walk - 41 miles across the hostile terrain of the North York Moors, finally getting his time down to an acceptable 8 1/2 hours. The long miles across barren moor helped to stimulate his fantasy. He was also responsible for starting a flying saucer scare, arousing a lot of interest. He then assumed the role of amateur astronomer and contacted the local press, expounding his theories on the possibility of life on other planets. Suitably convinced they printed his explanations in the evening editions.</p>

 New Beginnings </st>


<p>

In 1970 he moved to London and took a job as a laboratory technician at the Polytechnic of Central London (now <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../123/6179123.xml">

). It was while he was there that he began writing song lyrics as well as poetry but it was his single-handed construction of an oversized model of one-and-a-half turns of the DNA helix out of pieces of plastic for an Open-Day exhibition that caused the most comment and lined him up as a research assistant. From 1971 on he began performing his poetry spontaneously at folk clubs, bars and colleges, sometimes warming up audiences for star performers such as Noel Murphy of the Dubliners. He occasionally "gigged" with fellow poets Pete Brown and Liverpool Poet Brian Patton. Even then he resisted suggestions he get his poetry published, maintaining that he only wrote for his own performances and not to be read. It was the performance and not the reading that for him took the poetry off the page and brought it to life. But, in 1973, at the behest of local talent scout Andy Gould who at the time worked for Radio Luxembourg, he wrote an English lyric for a French song which went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest for Luxembourg! He wasn't expecting it as it was intended to be a joke but the song Wonderful Dream, sung by Anne-Marie David, which for him didn't match up to his other lyrics, entered the UK charts and enabled him to leave his steady employment for good and become part of the underground music scene as a rock-poet. Embarrassed at the song's success he changed his name to Gabe Rainbow in time for the US release - it got a "rave" review in Billboard. So, to distance himself even further he went through several name changes, including Abbey Swine and Arfur Sparkle. In 1973, together with rock musicians <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../714/9193714.xml">

 where, after six months at Peter Stein's Schaubühne Theater with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/318505.xml">
Robert Wilson</link>, he decided to stay. </p>
<p>

During the 1980's he not only appeared in a number of English language theatre productions in West Berlin, he also kept up his music performances with local Berlin musicians as well as his UK friends. As anti-glitter rocker "Arfur Sparkle" or "Shaun Lawton &amp; The Flying Pigs" they toured around Berlin, Hamburg and wine festivals on the Mosel. In November 1989 they played the "Quasimodo Jazz Keller" as the Berlin Wall was falling down. Time in another fit of stage presence.</p>
<p>

Currently he is on tour as the magician Merlin in the Purcell and Dryden semi-opera, King Arthur, with the Berlin based Lautten Compagney. The tour takes in historical baroque theatres in Germany, such as the Markgräflichestheater in Bayreuth as well as the Theatre Royal in Bury St. Edmunds.
Most recently he sang for Rita Kantimir-Thomä after the International Women's Day Awards in Berlin at which she received (Germany's) 'Woman of the Year Award' for her continued commitment to protecting refugees.</p>
<p>

He continues to write poetry and songs and acts in theatre, television and films (in English as well as German) including the upcoming film <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

He is together with trauma specialist Sibylle Rothkegel who set up treatment centres for torture and war victims in the Balkans in the 1990’s. She holds a post at the International Academy (INA) at the Free University of Berlin, and she evaluates UNHCR projects on Gender Specific Violence (GSV) in refugee camps in Africa and South America. She champions the fight against the practice of female genital mutilation.
In 1998 she was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz - the highest civilian order in Germany.</p>
