About FFA</st>
<p>

<b>FFA</b> was the acronym for Future Farmers of America but the organization, in an effort to broaden its potential membership beyond youth working in traditional "production" agriculture, changed its official name from Future Farmers of America to the National FFA Organization in 1988; it is now officially named The National FFA Organization. High school students compete in various events called Career Development Events (CDEs). Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) programs, and Leadership Development Events (LDEs) are programs designed to broaden the students abilities and experience in different fields of agriculture. Students are supervised by agricultural education teachers in cooperation with parents, employers and other adults who assist individuals in the development and achievement of educational and career goals</p>

FFA Structure</st>
<p>

The FFA is represented at several different levels across the nation, changing from state to state. The basic levels are the national level, serving all of the United States of America; the state level, serving an individual state; and the chapter level, serving a school or set of schools in an area. Other levels include names such as districts, sections, regions, etc.</p>
<p>

Originally created to serve high school students, the FFA has recently moved into elementaries, allowing members to become active earlier and stay active for longer. Each chapter is chartered as part of the state association and national organization. Collegiate chapter now exist, as well.</p>
<p>

The higher levels of FFA hold conventions at least once a year, where members get together to be inspired, renew their faith in agriculture, compete in contests, and do much more. The National FFA Convention is held once a year, and was originally held in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Officers of FFA</st>

As the FFA is a member-led organization intended to serve youth around the Nation, it elects officers from its own diverse membership to certain levels of the FFA. At the Chapter level, and many other levels, officers elected are usually:</p>

Official FFA Dress</st>
<p>

The most recognizable symbol of the organization is the blue jacket that is worn by current FFA members. Originally created to be worn by the Fredericktown Band of the Fredericktown FFA Chapter by Dr. Gus Lintner, the Official FFA Jacket was adopted in 1933 as the Organization's Official Dress. Official Dress for members is as follows:</p>
<p>

Males:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Black slacks</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 White collared button-up shirt (tucked in)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

</list>
</p>
<p>

Females:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Knee-length black skirt or black slacks</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 White collared button-down blouse (tucked in)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Official FFA jacket zipped to the top</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Black nylon hosiery</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Members through their time in the FFA work to earn metal pins to place on their jackets. Awards include contests pins and proficiency awards. There should never be more than 3 pins on the front of the jacket below the name including the highest office, highest award, and highest degree. Degree pins include Discovery, Greenhand, Chapter, State, and American. Offices include President, Vice President, Reporter, Secretary, Treasurer, Sentinel, Historian, Chaplin, Parliamentarian, and other appointed positions. If a member has earned the State or American FFA degree no other pins should be displayed. These degrees may either be placed on a chain hung from the jacket or placed above the name on the front. No other pins should be displayed either way in these cases. If the member holds the American Degree the state degree should also be removed.</p>
<p>

Over the years, FFA jackets have come in many forms and colors. Changing suppliers and newer design specifications allowed the jacket to fit awkwardly and the color to turn a deep purple, with orange emblem. Efforts by the National FFA, under the campaign "Only Blue Will Do," redesigned the FFA jacket to its original crisp blue color. In addition, the cost of the jacket was lowered, and original design elements were restored, such as specialized stitching. All new jackets now are produced to strict standards of quality.</p>

The FFA Creed</st>
<p>

The FFA creed was written by Erwin Milton "E.M." Tiffany of Wisconsin, and adopted at the 3rd National Convention of the FFA. It was revised at the 38th Convention and the 63rd Convention. It is recited by new members to the organization, to reflect their growing belief in agriculture and agricultural education it also must be memorized and recited to earn the Greenhand Degree.</p>
<p>

<it>I believe in the future of agriculture; with a faith born not of words but of deeds - achievements won by the present and past generations of agriculturists; in the promise of better days through better ways, even as the better things we now enjoy have come to us from the struggles of former years.</it></p>
<p>

<it>I believe that to live and work on a good farm or to be engaged in other agricultural pursuits is pleasant as well as challenging; for I know the joys and discomforts of agricultural life and hold an inborn fondness for those associations which, even in hours of discouragement I can not deny.</it></p>
<p>

<it>I believe in leadership from ourselves and respect from others. I believe in my own ability to work efficiently and think clearly with such knowledge and skill as I can secure and in the ability of progressive agriculturalists to serve our own and the public interest in producing and marketing the product of our toil.</it></p>
<p>

<it>I believe in less dependence on begging and more power in bargaining; in the life abundant and enough honest wealth to help make it so-for others as well as myself; in less need for charity and more of it when needed; in being happy myself and playing square with those whose happiness depends upon me.</it></p>
<p>

<it>I believe that American agriculture can and will hold true to the best traditions of our national life and that I can exert an influence in my home and community which will stand solid for my part in that inspiring task.</it></p>
