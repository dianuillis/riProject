In 2003, Arkansas State University decided to make a new mascot, named 'Red', created by ASU’s Director of Athletic Marketing Andrea Scott. <p>

“The spirit character began as a project to design a character that looks friendly, is unique, and is not an animal,” Andrea said. “I was looking for something out of the ordinary that’s presence could elevate spirit at ball games.”</p>
<p>

“Red absolutely will not replace Arkansas State’s official mascot, the Indian Family,” said Dr. Dean Lee, ASU Director of Athletics. </p>
<p>

“Red was named because that was how he was perceived by the marketing analysis and research groups, which were children and youth,” said Dr. Dean Lee, ASU’s Athletic Director.</p>

</b> – 1931
A year after the Warrior name was added, they decided to change it to the Indians, because they were similar.</p>
<p>

The Indian Family are three students, which include Chief Big Track, named after the legendary chief of the Osage Tribe.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

“The Indian Family maintains a stately and dignified persona befitting the Indian tribes which once lived in this area as the official mascot of Arkansas State athletics and they will still have a major presence at our game day events,” said Lee.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

<b>‘Red’</b> – 2003 ~ ‘Red’ was created as a spirit character to bring excitement to women’s and men’s athletic events for the youth. He was not the official mascot. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

<b>Red Wolves (Howl)</b> – 2008 ~ Because of the NCAA rules, Arkansas State was forced to change their Indian name to the Red Wolves</p>

On June 18, 2007, Arkansas State's Mascot Review Committee unanimously approved a recommendation for Arkansas State to retire the "Indians" nickname and all Native American mascots and imagery. The time frame for finding a new mascot is yet to be determined.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Chancellor Robert L. Potts promised a broad-based search to be guided by a Mascot Selection Steering Committee. The move for the name change comes in response to the NCAA's 2005 ban on ethnically or racially derogatory mascots at championship events.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
