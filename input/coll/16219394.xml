waste streams</link> described here are not unique to them. But cruise ships and their passengers and large crews generate more than average amounts of sewage, greywater, and solid waste. They may also have an outsized effect on the subset of ports and coastal areas that see much cruise-ship activity.</p>

Solid waste</st>
<p>

Solid waste generated on a ship includes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/12581.xml">
glass</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/16861908.xml">

steel</link> cans, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/23883.xml">
plastic</link>s. It can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature. Solid waste that enters the ocean may become <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/1827851.xml">
marine debris</link>, and it can then pose a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries that utilize marine waters. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../416/16544416.xml">
source reduction</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/5149747.xml">
waste minimisation</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../157/70157.xml">
recycling</link>. However, as much as 75% of solid waste is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/216187.xml">
incinerated</link> on board, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../798/13030798.xml">

Marine mammal</link>s, fish, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../905/142905.xml">
sea turtle</link>s, and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships. On average, each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day and disposes of two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/228744.xml">

must be off-loaded (for example, because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated), cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities, which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel (especially at non-North American ports).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

Hazardous waste</st>
<p>

Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from a number of on-board activities and processes, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../408/204408.xml">
photographic processing</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../118/172118.xml">
dry cleaning</link>, and equipment cleaning. Types of waste include discarded and expired <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/9722260.xml">
chemical</link>s, medical waste, batteries, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../056/144056.xml">
fluorescent light</link>s, and spent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/23776.xml">
paint</link>s and thinners, among others. These materials contain a wide range of substances such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/13257.xml">
hydrocarbon</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/1271805.xml">
chlorinated hydrocarbon</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../671/47671.xml">
heavy metals</link>, paint waste, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/37431.xml">
solvent</link>s, fluorescent and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/1125543.xml">
mercury vapor light bulb</link>s, various types of batteries, and unused or outdated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/180121.xml">
pharmaceutical</link>s. Although the quantities of hazardous waste generated on cruise ships are small, their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/170567.xml">
toxicity</link> to sensitive marine organisms can be significant. Without careful management, these wastes can find their way into graywater, bilge water, or the solid waste</p>

Bilge water</st>
<p>

On a ship, oil often leaks from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/9640.xml">
engine</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../462/51462.xml">
machine</link>ry spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with water in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../168/88168.xml">
bilge</link>, the lowest part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/13755.xml">
hull</link> of the ship. Oil, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/23639.xml">
gasoline</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../885/726885.xml">
by-product</link>s from the biological breakdown of petroleum products can harm fish and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/144219.xml">
wildlife</link> and pose threats to human health if ingested. Oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/5221389.xml">
sub-lethal</link> chronic effects. Bilge water also may contain solid wastes and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../872/24872.xml">
pollutant</link>s containing high amounts of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/420598.xml">
oxygen-demanding</link> material, oil and other chemicals. A typical large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each  24 hours of operation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> To maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../505/32505.xml">
vapor</link>s in these areas, the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry. However, before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged, the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water, after which the extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, and/or offloaded in port. If a separator, which is normally used to extract the oil, is faulty or is deliberately bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean, where it can damage marine life. A number of cruise lines have been charged with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../391/4363391.xml">
environmental violation</link>s related to this issue in recent years.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

One source of environmental pressures on maritime vessels recently has come from states and localities, as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked in port. For instance, large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7% of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/53842.xml">

. Ships can also have a significant impact in areas without large commercial ports: they contribute about 37% of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/108139.xml">

 area, and that percentage is expected to increase to 61% by the year 2015.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Again, there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue. They comprise only a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly. Shipboard incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and other waste, producing ash that must be disposed of. Incinerators may release toxic emissions as well.</p>
