SSSRA</st>

<p>

The Frankfort Square Park District has been a member of the South Suburban Special Recreation Association (SSSRA) since 1989. The FSPD donated park property and was involved in the entire construction process from the initial planning stages through the completion of SSSRA’s administrative offices and ongoing maintenance issues. FSPD’s Executive Director drafted an agreement with ten member districts to complete the sale of alternate bonds in the amount of <currency wordnetid="113385913" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/18717338.xml">
US$</link></currency>
750,000.   </p>
<p>

Illinois State Representative, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/1369839.xml">
Kevin McCarthy</link> additionally secured a US$500,000 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/5460444.xml">
State Line</link> Item Grant for office construction.  SSSRA’s new home, completed in 2003, has given the association greater stability and visibility within the community as well has allowed for more programming to better serve residents.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Early Learning Center</st>

<p>

The Early Learning Center is a preschool program that is offered by the Frankfort Square Park District.  The program was established in 1981.  It is centered on developing the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive skills of children aged three to five.  The Early Learning Center grew from two classes a day in 1989 to four classes when the new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/2689823.xml">
community center</link> was constructed in 1991.  After the passing of a referendum to expand the center, new classrooms were added, doubling the current space.  Additionally, a new playground was built adjacent to the classrooms.</p>

<st>
Early Years</st>

<p>

The Frankfort Square Park District was incorporated in 1974.  The first community meetings were held in local homes because no administration building had been established. Dennis O’Brien was hired <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../796/1798796.xml">
part time</link> in 1975 on a contractual basis and he worked as park director until 1981.  He wrote 10 park programs per year and supervised the offerings.  The staff began with one semi-full time employee, Diane Veltman.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The first administration building was erected next to the old Summit <school wordnetid="108276720" confidence="0.8">
<educational_institution wordnetid="108276342" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../585/2836585.xml">

</educational_institution>
</school>
.  Today this building is still being used for group meetings as well as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../291/1303291.xml">
concession stand</link>.  </p>
<p>

In 1990, US$1 million in financing was provided to the park district to build the current community center located on Braemar Lane in Frankfort.  The construction was completed in 1991. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
1991 - Today</st>

<p>

In 2002, a majority of voters approved a US$5 million <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../582/51582.xml">
referendum</link>, providing funds to meet master plan objectives including expansion of programming, facilities, and properties.   The expansion of the Community Center provided for additional offices, board room, kitchen, and preschool classrooms and was completed in 2003. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

In late 2007, the FSPD was awarded the Gold Medal Award from the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) for excellence in park and recreation management.  The park district won for a Class V district, which includes all districts with less than 25,000 residents.  The Frankfort Square Park District was the only winner from Illinois in 2007. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
