<b>Raw feeding</b> is the practice of feeding domestic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/4269567.xml">
dog</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/6678.xml">
cat</link>s  a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../924/639924.xml">
diet</link> primarily of un<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../355/5355.xml">

They are commonly opposed to commercial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../731/3884731.xml">
pet food</link>s, which they believe are detrimental to an animal's health. Opponents believe that the risk of nutritional imbalance, intestinal perforations and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/531611.xml">

 has also been criticized.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

While the scientific community contend that no studies have been done to support the numerous beneficial claims of a raw diet, raw feeders feel that the burden of proof to show that commercial diets are superior and safer than raw diets rest on pet food manufacturers and veterinarians.</p>

Objection to commercial pet food</st>
<p>

The intense heat used to process commercial pet food destroys and reduces nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and enzymes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Studies with rats showed that the digestibility of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/1207.xml">
amino acid</link>s in cat food is changed significantly by heat processing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  Pet food manufacturers must supplement the food after heat processing to replace those nutrients. Some raw feeders believe that supplements have reduced nutritional value compared to the same nutrients in raw food and that possible nutrients not yet recognized as essential by nutritional science cannot be replaced. The same rationale is used by some to reject supplemented home cooked pet food. Some raw feeders, however, also include supplements such as fish oil, and various vitamins or multivitamins mix. &#91;&#93;</p>
<p>

Commercial pet foods, dry foods in particular, often contain a large amount of grains, which proponents of grain-free food feel are inappropriate for dogs and cats. Because cats are obligate carnivores, it is believed that a switch to a predominantly meat based raw diet would be especially beneficial (as compared to a raw diet for dogs) due to cats' relative inability to digest grains. Studies comparing the source of protein in dry cat food concluded that the digestibility of meat-based protein is superior to corn-based protein.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> </p>
<p>

Veterinary surgeon and raw feeding proponent Tom Lonsdale states that food from dry or canned commercial kibble sticks to teeth and enables bacteria to proliferate, causing "sore gums, bad breath and bacterial poisons that affect the rest of the body". Lonsdale further states that dogs lack the necessary enzymes to digest grains and plant material and claims that grains cooked at high temperature can cause starch, proteins and fats to become "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../456/8456.xml">
denatured</link> or toxic in variable degrees." The poorly digested grains is said to support toxin-producing bacteria in the lower bowel which may eventually lead to "poisons pass[iing] through the bowel wall into blood circulation" creating "further problems" in other organs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

There are various differences in opinion within the raw feeding community. Issues includes the question of whether dogs are omnivores or carnivores and if they need plant material in their diet, and if so, the proportion of such material. The safety of whole bones is also a frequent topic of discussion</p>



<ss1>
<st>
Prey model</st>
<p>

The "Prey model" diet attempts to simulate the proportions of an actual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/57559.xml">
prey animal</link> in a pet's diet, as dogs are actually carnivores. This includes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/342509.xml">
organ meat</link>, heads, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/27978.xml">
skin</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/19723734.xml">
muscle</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../099/4099.xml">
bone</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/3997.xml">
blood</link> and even small amounts of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/19009006.xml">
fur</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/50873.xml">
feather</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/40650.xml">
scale</link>s, mimicking the amounts that would be consumed when eating small prey. Generally, the diet recommends 80% meat (including some 'meaty' organs such as heart), 10% bone and 10% organs (of which half is liver). The supporters of the prey model also focus on feeding meats from a wide variety of animals.</p>
<p>

Supplements are generally not used in a prey model diet although some followers do add <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/999306.xml">
fish oil</link> to the diet to compensate for the reduced amount of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/22594.xml">
omega-3 fatty acid</link> in commercially raised grain-fed livestock.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

</ss1>

<st>
Barf</st>
<p>

The "BARF" diet, an acronym for <it>Biologically Appropriate Raw Food</it> or <it>Bones And Raw Food</it> was created by <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/4689264.xml">
Australia</link></country>
n <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../575/495575.xml">
veterinary surgeon</link> Dr Ian Billinghurst. A typical BARF diet is made up of 60-80% of raw meaty bones(RMB), that is bones with about 50% meat,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>(e.g. chicken neck, back and wings) and 20-40% of fruits and vegetables, offal, meat, eggs, or dairy foods.</p>
<p>

The concept has been implemented worldwide. In Denmark, the BARF concept was introduced and refined by Mr. Lars Madsen from Dansk Barf Center. In Denmark it is not advisable to use chicken in a BARF diet due to the excessive use of pharmaceuticals in the chicken industry.</p>

 Nutritional balance </st>
<p>

As raw diets can range from meticulously prepared and tested to diets composed of a variety of meats and butchers' scraps, the nutritional balance of a raw diet can vary greatly depending on the recipe. However, supporters of raw feeding believe that not every meal needs to be "complete and balanced", and that nutritional balance can be achieved over time by feeding a wide variety of meats, fats, bones and organs from several sources, such as chicken, turkey, lamb, cattle, pigs, fish, rabbits, etc, and even wild game. The general belief among the supporters of raw diets is that pets have no more complex nutritional requirements than humans, and that a variety of ingredients over time will provide the pets with a sufficiently balanced diet.</p>
<p>

Many who oppose raw diets believe that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/3884785.xml">
Association of American Feed Control Officials</link> (AAFCO) standards that commercial pet food has to meet gives an assurance of quality that homemade food cannot give. One study that analyzed the nutritional content of three homemade diets (included the BARF diet) and two commercial raw food diets and compared it to the AAFCO standards, showed that nutritional imbalances occurred in multiple areas.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Three of the diets had abnormal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/5668.xml">
calcium</link>-to-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/23318.xml">
phosphorus</link> ratios which can lead to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../314/703314.xml">

fibrous osteodystrophy</link> in puppies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> </p>
<p>

A 12-month study undertaken for the Winn Feline Foundation by researchers from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../962/893962.xml">
UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine</link> sought to compare the effects of a whole ground rabbit diet with a high quality commercial diet on 22 kittens and adolescent cats. The ground whole rabbit diet(including fur and organs) was frozen in small batches and thawed prior to feeding. The researchers noted the superior palatability of the raw rabbit diet. Significant stool quality improvements were seen in the raw rabbit diet group after one week. After one month, the raw diet group had firm, non-odorous and well formed stools while the commercial diet group had soft formed to liquid stools. The raw diet group also appear to have better coat quality. There were no differences between the groups in terms of growth rate, degree of inflammation in the intestinal tract and the numbers of bacteria in the upper small intestine, although a slightly higher number of cats in the raw diet group were shedding pathogenic organisms (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/211647.xml">
Giardia</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/2206845.xml">
Cryptosporidia</link>) in their stools. Ten months into the study, one cat in the raw diet group died suddenly from dilated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../133/46133.xml">
cardiomyopathy</link> due to a severe taurine deficiency. 70% of the group had heart muscle change compatible with taurine deficiency. The researcher ascertained that the raw rabbit diet contained the minimal requirement of taurine but speculated that bacteria in the rabbit carcasses might have broken down some of the taurine. The processing and grinding of the rabbit might have also caused some of the taurine to be destroyed due to the low level of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../104/54104.xml">
vitamin E</link> in the diet. The authors conclude that "a natural diet may not always be as healthy as imagined, and that even measuring nutrient values may not predict how a diet will perform after being fed for many months."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>
<p>

When feeding a raw diet, even some proponents of raw diets recommend frequent analysis by a veterinarian or animal nutritionist to verify that proper nutrients are being ingested. Other proponents sometimes dismiss the importance of AAFCO standards, claiming that AAFCO certification is not indicative of the quality of a diet. An AAFCO panel expert has stated that "although the AAFCO profiles are better than nothing, they provide false securities."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> Many&#91;&#93; cite that the oldest dog ever recorded, a 29-year-old Australian cattle dog named Bluey, died in 1939, several years before commercial pet food was invented, and that, of the two oldest dogs in recent years, one was fed primarily on kangaroo and emu meat.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

Some proponents of raw diet claim noticeable benefit to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../724/14878724.xml">
dental hygiene</link> of pets who eat raw bones, while others believe that ground bone should be used instead, to prevent the possibility for intestinal puncturing and dental fractures. The abrasion between bone and teeth when chewing is believed to scrape off dental plaque. Cartilage, ligaments, and tendons are thought to act as a natural dental floss.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> The chewing and tearing action is also believed to strengthen the jaw, neck and shoulder muscles, keep the digestive juice flowing and boost the neurological and immune system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> Proponents of ground bones believe that the chewing of muscle meat may also assist in keeping teeth clean.</p>

Raw feeders consider the risk overblown and claim that the stomach enzymes and short intestinal tracts of dogs and cats allow them to handle harmful bacteria.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> For example, an outbreak of Salmonella caused by tainted commercial dry dog food led to 62 cases of human infection but no reports of the disease affecting animals fed the tainted food.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> On the other hand, there has been a reported case where two cats fed a raw diet developed salmonellosis and died as a result.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> A veterinarian from the National Animal Poison Control Center suggests that the diarrhea in animals that raw feeders attribute to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../305/11723305.xml">

Raw meats may also contain harmful parasites. As with bacteria, these parasites are destroyed during the heat processing of manufactured pet foods. Some raw diet recipes call for freezing of the final product, which greatly reduces (but does not necessarily eliminate) the potential for parasites.

A possible risk of raw feeding is that of human infection caused by direct or indirect exposure to bacterial pathogens in raw meat and  animal stools. For example the <link>
British Veterinary Association</link> warns that humans "risk exposing themselves to bacteria like salmonella". A small study on the levels of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/42114.xml">
salmonella</link> in the stool of 10 dogs that ate a raw diet found that 80% of the raw diet tested positive for <link>
Salmonella spp.</link> and while 30 percent of the stool samples from dogs fed a raw food diet contained salmonella, none of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../288/1640288.xml">
control</link> dogs (commercial fed) contained salmonella. The authors of the study concluded that dogs on a raw food diet may therefore be a source of environmental contamination, although they caution about the statistical significance of their results due to the small number of dogs studied.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> </p>
<p>

Because of the potential animal and human health risks, veterinarian organizations and public health agencies believe that the risks inherent in raw feeding outweigh the purported benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref>  Despite such concerns, there is no known incidence of humans being infected with salmonella by cats and dogs fed a raw diet.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref> Again, proper food safety precautions such as wiping down preparation surfaces and careful disposal of stools can reduce the risk of infection.</p>

After the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../152/10588152.xml">
2007 pet food recall</link>, interest in raw and cooked homemade pet food grew tremendously.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref>
As a result of that, more pet food manufacturers now offer frozen raw diet products for pet owners. Some consumers believe that many of the same issues they find with commercial pet foods exist with packaged raw diets, others use it due to its convenience and for products with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/3884785.xml">
AAFCO</link> certification, its assurance of a nutritionally balanced product.</p>

<p>

Veterinary associations such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/886212.xml">
American Veterinary Medical Association</link>, British Veterinary Association and Canadian Veterinary Medical Association have warned of the animal and public health risk that could arise from feeding raw meat to pets and have stated that there is no scientific evidence to support the claimed benefits of raw feeding.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref>.</p>

More recently in 2007, <newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../082/259082.xml">
The Sydney Morning Herald</link></newspaper>
 (paraphrasing RSPCA Australia President Dr Hugh Wirth) reported that ""the 'compromise attitude' of veterinary associations in Britain and Australia is that raw meaty bones should be fed to pets a minimum of three times a week for dental health."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref>

Controversy</st>
<p>

It is believed by many raw feeders that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/229116.xml">
veterinarian</link>s are influenced by academic departments and professional associations that rely upon funding from pet food companies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref> For example, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../946/4187946.xml">
Hill's Pet Nutrition</link></company>
, makers of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/3131727.xml">
Science Diet</link></company>
 and a range of prescription only food is a major sponsor of the American Veterinary Medical Association.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref> Another common belief is that veterinarians lack adequate knowledge on raw diets or nutrition in general.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref> Frequently, veterinary schools receive nutrition training that is provided to students or sponsored by pet food manufacturers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref> The Wall Street Journal reports that Hill's "spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year funding university research and nutrition courses at every one of the 27 U.S. veterinary colleges" and that vets profit as much as 40% from sales of Science Diet and other foods sold from their offices.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref> Raw feeders are often skeptical of the motives that some veterinarians have in recommending the commercial foods they sell, pointing out the conflict of interest in them doing so.</p>
