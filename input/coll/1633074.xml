) <b>benefits in kind</b> (also called <b>fringe benefits</b>, <b>perquisites</b>, <b>perqs</b> or <b>perks</b>) are various non-wage compensations provided to <link>
employee</link>s in addition to their normal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/359646.xml">
wage</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../452/610452.xml">
salaries</link>. Where an employee exchanges (cash) wages for some other form of benefit, this is generally referred to as a 'salary sacrifice' arrangement. In most countries, most kinds of employee benefits are taxable to at least some degree.</p>
<p>

Fringe benefits can include, but are not limited to: (employer-provided or employer-paid) housing, group insurance (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">

The purpose of the benefits is to increase the economic security of employees.</p>
<p>

The term <b>perqs</b> or <b>perks</b> is often used colloquially to refer to those benefits of a more discretionary nature. Often, perks are given to employees who are doing notably well and/or have seniority. Common perks are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/3228278.xml">

.  Some function as tax shelters (for example, flexible spending accounts, 401(k)'s, 403(b)'s). Fringe benefits are also thought of as the costs of keeping employees other than salary. These benefit rates are typically calculated using fixed percentages that vary depending on the employeeâ€™s classification and often change from year to year.  </p>

Normally, employer provided benefits are tax-deductible to the employer and non-taxable to the employee.  The exception to the general rule includes certain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../681/5681.xml">

 corporations may also offer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../924/8710924.xml">
cafeteria plan</link>s to their employees.  These plans would offer a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/406264.xml">
menu</link> and level of benefits for employees to choose from.  In most instances, these plans are funded by both the employees and by the employer(s).  The portion paid by the employees are deducted from their gross pay before federal and state taxes are applied.  Some benefits would still be subject to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../096/560096.xml">
FICA</link> tax, such as 401(k) and 403(b) contributions; however, health premiums, some life premiums, and contributions to flexible spending accounts are exempt from FICA.</p>
<p>

If certain conditions are met, employer provided meals and lodging may be excluded from an employee's gross income.  If meals are furnished (1) by the employer; (2) for the employer's convenience; and (3) provided on the business premises of the employer they may be excluded from the employee's gross income per Section 119(a).  In addition, lodging furnished by the employer for its convenience on the business premise of the employer (which the employee is required to accept as a condition of employment) is also excluded from gross income.  Importantly, section 119(a) only applies to meals or lodging furnished "in kind."  Therefore, cash allowances for meals or lodging received by an employee are included in gross income .    </p>

<p>

In the UK, Employee Benefits are categorised by three terms:</p>
<p>

Flexible Benefits (Flex) and Flexible Benefits Packages, Voluntary Benefits and Core Benefits.</p>
<p>

Flexible Benefits most often called a "Flex Scheme" is where employees are allowed to choose how a proportion of their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/1650660.xml">
remuneration</link> is paid. Currently around a quarter of UK employers operate such a scheme.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>
. This is normally delivered by allowing employees to sacrifice part of their pre-tax pay in exchange for a car, additional holiday, a shorter working week or other similar benefits, or give up benefits for additional cash remuneration. A number of external consultancies exist that enable organizations to manage Flex packages and they centre around the provision of an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/37481.xml">
Intranet</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/131823.xml">
Extranet</link> website where employees can view their current flexible benefit status and make changes to their package.</p>
<p>

Voluntary Benefits is the name given to a collection of benefits that employees choose to opt-in for and pay for personally. These tend to be schemes such as the government-backed (and therefore tax-efficient) Bike2Work and Childcare Vouchers (Accor Services, Busybees, Sodexho) and also specially arranged discount schemes for employees such as group ISAs.  Employee Discount schemes are often setup by employers as a perk of working at the organization. They can be run inhouse or arranged by an external employee benefits consultant.</p>
<p>

Core Benefits is the term given to benefits which all staff enjoy, such as holiday, sick pay and sometimes flexible hours.</p>
<p>

In the UK, the employee benefit market is split between larger employee benefit consultancies (Mercers, Watson Wyatt, Towers Perrin, Hewitt), the mid-market (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/18659117.xml">
Buck Consultants</link>, SBJ, Thomsons Online Benefits]<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.thomsonsonlinebenefits.com">
