The <b>Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)</b><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> method is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../875/4562875.xml">
motion planning</link> algorithm in robotics, which solves the problem of determining a path between a starting configuration of the robot and a goal configuration while avoiding collisions.<p>

The basic idea behind PRM is to take random samples from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/473596.xml">
configuration space</link> of the robot, testing them for whether they are in the free space, and use a local planner to attempt to connect these configurations to other nearby configurations. The starting and goal configurations are added in, and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../731/6263731.xml">
graph search algorithm</link> is applied to the resulting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/325806.xml">
graph</link> to determine a path between the starting and goal configurations.</p>
<p>

PRM is provably probabilistically complete, meaning that as the number of sampled points increases without bound, the probability that the algorithm won't find a path if one exists approaches zero.</p>

The probabilistic roadmap method consists of two phases:
a construction and a query phase. In the construction phase, a
roadmap (graph) is built, approximating the motions that can
be made in the environment. First, a random con�guration
is created. Then, it is connected to some useful neighbors. A
neighbor is useful if its distance to the new con�guration is less
than a predetermined constant. Con�gurations and connections
are added to the graph until the roadmap is dense enough.
In the query phase, the start and goal con�gurations are
connected to the graph. The path is obtained by a Dijkstra's
shortest path query. See e.g. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> for a more extensive elaboration
of the PRM method.</p>
