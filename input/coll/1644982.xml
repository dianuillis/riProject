<b>Enterprise content management</b> (<b>ECM</b>) is a set of technologies used to capture, store, preserve and deliver <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/12766831.xml">
content</link> and documents and content related to organizational processes. ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's unstructured information, wherever that information exists. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>





<sec>
<st>
Definition</st>
<p>

The "official" definition of enterprise content management was created by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/2124982.xml">
AIIM</link> (Association for Information and Image Management) International, the worldwide association for enterprise content management in the year 2000. The abbreviation ECM has been reinterpreted and redefined many times <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

This new term is intended to completely encompass the legacy problem domains that have traditionally been addressed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/1362816.xml">
records management</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
document management</link>.  It also includes all of the additional problems involved in converting to and from digital content, to and from the traditional media of those problem domains (such as physical and computerized filing and retrieval systems, often involving paper and microforms). Finally ECM is a new problem domain in its own right, as it has employed the technologies and strategies of (digital) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/223240.xml">
content management</link> to address business process issues, such as records and auditing, knowledge sharing, personalization and standardization of content, and so on.</p>

History</st>

<p>

New product suites have arisen from the combination of capture, search and networking capabilities with technologies of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/223240.xml">
content management</link> field, which have traditionally addressed digital archiving, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
document management</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/76656.xml">
workflow</link>. Generally speaking, this is when content management becomes <it>enterprise content management</it>.  The different nomenclature is intended to encompass all of the problem areas related to the use and preservation of information within an organization, in all of its forms — not just its web-oriented face to the outside world.  Therefore, most solutions focus on "business to employee" (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../055/12130055.xml">
B2E</link></it>) systems.  However, as the solutions have evolved, new components to content management have arisen.  For example, as unstructured content is checked in and out of an ECM system, each use can potentially enrich the content's profile, to some extent automatically, so that the system might gradually acquire or "learn" new filtering, routing and search pathways, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/2970490.xml">
corporate taxonomies</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../109/29109.xml">
semantic networks</link>, which in turn assist in making better retention-rule decisions, determining which records or documents to keep, and which to discard, and when.  Such issues become all the more important, as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">
email</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/55951.xml">
instant messaging</link> are increasingly employed in the decision-making processes in an organization.</p>
<p>

Thus, the term enterprise content management refers to solutions that concentrate on providing in-house information, usually using internet technologies. The solutions tend to provide <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/37481.xml">
intranet</link> services to employees (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../055/12130055.xml">
B2E</link>), but also include <link>
enterprise portals</link> for "business to business" (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../261/1678261.xml">
B2B</link></it>), "business to government" (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/596775.xml">
B2G</link></it>), or "government to business" (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/12130135.xml">
G2B</link></it>), etc. This category includes most of the former document management <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/42005.xml">
groupware</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/76656.xml">
workflow</link> solutions that have not yet fully converted their architecture, but provide a web interface to their applications. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../719/925719.xml">
Digital Asset Management</link> (DAM) is as well a form of ECM that is concerned with content stored using digital electronic technology.</p>
<p>

The technology components that comprise ECM today are the descendants of the electronic document management systems (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link>) software products that were first released in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> products were developed as stand-alone technologies, and these products provided functionality in one of four areas: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../446/226446.xml">
imaging</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/76656.xml">
workflow</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
document management</link>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/2015478.xml">
COLD/ERM</link> (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Components+of+an+enterprise+content+management+system%22])">
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Components of an enterprise content management system</entry>
</list>
</link> below).</p>
<p>

For the software companies, it made sense to develop different products for each of these distinct <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> functions. At that time, most organizations that were candidates for EDMS generally wanted a solution to address just one overriding business need or application. They were looking for stand-alone solutions to address narrow application needs, many of them at the departmental level &ndash; such as imaging for forms processing, workflow for insurance claims processing, document management for engineering documentation, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/2015478.xml">
COLD/ERM</link> for distributing and archiving monthly financial reports. </p>
<p>

The typical "early adopter" of these new technologies was an organization that deployed a small-scale imaging and workflow system, possibly to just a single department, in order to improve the efficiency of a repetitive, paper-intensive business process and migrate towards the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../272/11441272.xml">
Paperless office</link>. Even in these early years, when the market for these software products was still relatively immature, it was clear that each of the major technologies within <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> offered tremendous value to specific organizational processes or applications, at a time when business processes were overwhelmingly paper-based. The primary benefits that the first stand-alone <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> technologies brought to organizations revolved around saving time or improving accessibility to information. Among the specific benefits were the following:</p>

<p>

Through the late 1990s, the various segments of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> industry continued to grow steadily, if not spectacularly. The technologies appealed to organizations with clear problems, and which needed targeted, tactical solutions to address those problems. </p>
<p>

As time passed, and more organizations had achieved "pockets" of productivity with the use of these technologies, it became clear that the various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> product categories were in fact complementary for many businesses. Organizations increasingly wanted to be able to leverage the capabilities of multiple <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> products. Consider, for example, the needs of a customer service department, where <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../446/226446.xml">
imaging</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
document management</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/76656.xml">
workflow</link> functionality could be brought together to allow agents to access any information needed to resolve a customer inquiry. Likewise, an accounting department could access supplier invoices from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/2015478.xml">
COLD/ERM</link> system, purchase orders from an imaging system, and contracts from a document management system as part of an approval workflow. And as more and more organizations established an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> presence, they wanted to present certain portions of this information via the web, which required the capabilities to manage web content. Furthermore, organizations that had installed the software in individual departments now began to envision wider benefits, if they were to deploy it across the enterprise. Consider the fact that many business documents cross multiple departments and multiple business processes. Why not improve the management of electronic documents throughout the organization, and gain the same business benefits at an enterprise level?</p>
<p>

Both the market and the software providers began to understand the strategic potential of software products that integrated the individual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> technology components into a single, integrated solution, capable of addressing an organization's complete information management needs. In fact, the movement toward integrated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> solutions merely reflected a common trend in the history of the software industry: the obsolescence of certain types of products and the convergence of technologies, as vendors melded them into new packages. </p>
<p>

Consider office suites, for instance. In the 1970s and early 1980s, word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software products were standalone products. Within an organization, however, the same users were likely to need all three products. The software vendors responded, and started packaging them as integrated office suites &ndash; a strategy that also helped address consumer demand for tighter interoperability among desktop applications.</p>
<p>

The situation was similar in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> world. Just about any company that needed document management also needed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../446/226446.xml">
imaging</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/76656.xml">
workflow</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../885/75885.xml">
web content management</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/2015478.xml">
COLD/ERM</link>. Organizations began to demand multiple EDMS services and ways to leverage them for broad-based applications. Thus, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> vendors took steps to  deliver on truly integrated solutions incorporating the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> component technologies. </p>
<p>

The leaders tended to be those vendors that already offered multiple stand-alone <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> technologies. For these vendors, the early steps toward consolidation were small ones. The first phase was to offer multiple systems as a single, packaged "suite." Early suites were little more than multiple products being sold together at a reduced price, and there was a perception in the market that such suites were a strategy on the part of the vendors to capture additional seats within a customer account. Not surprisingly, market acceptance was limited &ndash; at least initially.</p>
<p>

But in the late 1990s, these software vendors began a major surge of software development and acquisition activity, adding capabilities to their software products or buying the software companies whose products offered the functional capabilities they needed. Integrating the products into a single solution has proven to be an ongoing challenge for many of these vendors. Scalability &ndash; that is, the ability of a software product to continue to function well when it is deployed on a wide scale &ndash; also presented some significant problems, as organizations demanded solutions that could be deployed not just to multiple geographic locations, but on a global scale, to tens of thousands of users.</p>
<p>

In response to these market demands, the major software providers put considerable development effort into addressing these issues, and they continue to enhance the capabilities of their products and to expand the types of content those products can manage. Beginning in approximately 2001, the industry began to use the term "enterprise content management" to refer to those software solutions that provide the full complement of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
EDMS</link> technologies, reflecting the truly "enterprise" nature of their products. </p>
<p>

More recently, the ECM market has seen the entry of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../001/19001.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/22591.xml">
Oracle Corporation</link></company>
, two of the largest and most pervasive providers of software, at the value end of the market <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. These companies have each taken steps to develop solutions for content management &ndash; Microsoft with its various offerings in the SharePoint product family in recent years, and Oracle in 2006 with its Oracle Content Management product. These two software companies look to provide software solutions with the basic ECM functionality that will address the functional requirements commonly required by the majority of organizations. The result is likely to be a stratification of the current ECM market, based on the level of content services that different organizations require <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>.</p>
<p>

Independently of Microsoft and Oracle, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/18938758.xml">

Characteristics</st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/223240.xml">
Content management</link> has many facets including enterprise content management, Web content management (WCM), content syndication and digital or media asset management. Enterprise content management is a vision, a strategy, or even a new industry, but it is not a closed system solution or a distinct product. Therefore, along with DRT (Document Related Technologies) or DLM (Document Lifecycle Management), ECM can be considered as just one possible catch-all term for a wide range of technologies and vendors.</p>
<p>

A comparison of the definitions of the different application fields of ECM and WCM makes it clear that the existing system category distinctions cannot last long, whether for products and technical platforms or for usage models. Solutions that are used as pure in-house solutions today will be made accessible to partners or customers tomorrow. The content and structure of today's outward-directed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/54293.xml">
web portal</link> will be the platform for tomorrow's internal information system. In his article in <it>ComputerWoche</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>, Ulrich Kampffmeyer concentrated the claimed benefit of an enterprise content management system to three key ideas that distinguish such solutions from Web content management:</p>

<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

 "Enterprise Content Management as integrative middleware</entry>
<entry level="1" type="indent">

 ECM is used to overcome the restrictions of former vertical applications and island architectures. The user is basically unaware of using an ECM solution. ECM offers the requisite infrastructure for the new world of web-based IT, which is establishing itself as a kind of third platform alongside conventional host and client/server systems. Therefore, EAI <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/842555.xml">
Enterprise Application Integration</link> and SOA <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../924/666924.xml">
Service Oriented Architecture</link> will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

 Enterprise Content Management components as independent services</entry>
<entry level="1" type="indent">

 ECM is used to manage Information without regard to the source or the required use. The functionality is provided as a service that can be used from all kinds of applications. The advantage of a service concept is that for any given functionality only one general service is available, thus avoiding redundant, expensive and difficult to maintain parallel functions. Therefore, standards for interfaces connecting different services will play an important role in the implementation of ECM.''</entry>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

 Enterprise Content Management as an uniform repository for all types of information</entry>
<entry level="1" type="indent">

 ECM is used as a content warehouse (both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/7990.xml">
data warehouse</link> and document warehouse) that combines company information in a repository with a uniform structure. Expensive redundancies and associated problems with information consistency are eliminated. All applications deliver their content to a single repository, which in turn provides needed information to all applications. Therefore, Content Integration and ILM <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../083/3331083.xml">
Information Lifecycle Management</link> will play an important role in the implementation and use of ECM.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Enterprise Content Management is working properly when it is effectively "invisible" to users. ECM technologies are infrastructures that support specialized applications as subordinate services. ECM thus is a collection of infrastructure components that fit into a multi-layer model and include all Document Related Technologies (DRT) for handling, delivering, and managing structured data and unstructured information jointly. As such, Enterprise Content Management is one of the necessary basic components of the overarching E-Business application area. ECM also sets out to manage all the information of a WCM and covers archiving needs as an universal repository."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> </p>

Components of an enterprise content management system</st>

<p>

Enterprise content management systems combine a wide variety of technologies and components, some of which can also be used as stand-alone systems without being incorporated into an enterprise-wide system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

The five ECM components and technologies of the ECM model were first defined by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/2124982.xml">
AIIM</link> as follows:</p>
<p>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

</list>
</p>
<p>

The model includes in the "Manage" category five traditional application areas:</p>

</list>
</p>
<p>

These "Manage" components connect Capture, Store, Deliver and Preserve and can be used in combination or separately. While Document Management, Web Content Management, Collaboration, Workflow and Business Process Management are more for the dynamic part of the life cycle of information, Records Management takes care of information which will no longer be changed. The utilization of the information is paramount throughout, whether through independent clients of the ECM system components, or by enabling existing applications that access the functionality of ECM services and the stored information. The integration of existing technologies makes it clear that ECM is not a new product category, but an integrative force.</p>
<p>

The individual categories and their components will be examined in the following.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

<ss1>
<st>
Capture</st>

<p>

The "Capture" category        contains functionalities and components for generating, capturing, preparing and processing analog and electronic information. There are several levels and technologies, from simple information capture to complex information preparation using automatic classification. Capture components are often also called "Input" components.</p>

<ss2>
<st>
Manually generated and captured information</st>
<p>

Manual capture can involve all forms of information, from paper documents to electronic office documents, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">

<p>

The objective of all "Capture" components is the provision of information to the "Manage" components for further processing or archiving.</p>

Manage</st>

<p>

The Manage components are for the management, processing, and use of information. They incorporate:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
Database</link>s for administration and retrieval, and</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Access authorization systems.</entry>

</p>
<p>

The goal of a closed ECM system is to provide these two components just once as services for all "Manage" solutions such as Document Management, Collaboration, Web Content Management, Records Management and Workflow / Business Process Management. To link the various "Manage" components, they should have standardized interfaces and secure transaction processes for inter-component communication.</p>

<ss2>
<st>
DM &ndash; Document Management</st>

<p>

Document management in this context does not refer to the industry known in Europe as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/291212.xml">
DMS</link>, but to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/71608.xml">
document management</link> systems in the narrower "classical" sense. These systems control documents from their creation through to long-term archiving. Document management includes functions like:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Check in/Check out for checking stored information for consistency</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Version management to keep track of different versions of the same information with their revisions and renditions (same information in a different format)</entry>

 Search and navigation for finding information and its associated contexts</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Visualizing for showing information in structures like virtual files, folders, and overviews</entry>

However, the functions or Document Management increasingly overlap with those of the other "Manage" components, the ever-expanding functionalities of office applications like Outlook/Exchange or Notes/Domino, and the characteristics of "Library Services" for administering information storage.</p>

WCM &ndash; Web Content Management</st>

<p>

Enterprise Content Management claims to integrate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/1853838.xml">
Web Content Management</link>. However, information presented on the Internet and Extranet or on a portal should only be data that is already present in the company, whose delivery is controlled by access authorization and storage. Web Content Management includes the following functions, among others:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Creation of new or editing of existing information in a controlled generation and publishing process</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Delivery and administration of information for the web presentation</entry>

 Secure separation of access to public and non-public information</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Visualization for Internet presentation (browser, HTML, XML etc.)</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

It is however worth noting that many in the industry do not consider WCM as an integral component to an ECM system. There are very few examples of successful implementations whereby a shared repository for documents (the core purpose of ECM) and web content are managed together. Indeed very different techniques and philosophies to structure and organize content are utilized for external facing web content than for internal facing document content. </p>

</p>
<p>

The objective is to largely automate processes by incorporating all necessary resources.</p>
<p>

BPM or Business Process Management goes a step further than Workflow. Although the words are often used interchangeably. BPM aims at the complete integration of all affected applications within an enterprise, with monitoring of processes and assembling of all required information. Among BPM's functions are:</p>

<p>

"Store" components are used for the temporary storage of information which it is not required or desired to archive. Even if it uses media that are suitable for long-term archiving, "Store" is still separate from "Preserve."</p>
<p>

The "Store" components listed by AIIM can be divided into three categories: "Repositories" as storage locations, "Library Services" as administration components for repositories, and storage "Technologies." These infrastructure components are sometimes held at the operating system level like the file system, and also include security technologies which will be discussed farther below in the "Deliver" section. However, security technologies including access control are superordinated components of an ECM solution.</p>

" components of ECM handle the long-term, safe storage and backup of static, unchanging information, as well as temporary storage of information that it is not desired or required to archive. This is sometimes called "electronic archiving," but that has substantially broader functionality than that of "Preserve." Electronic archiving systems today generally consist of a combination of administration software like Records Management, Imaging or Document Management, Library Services (IRS — Information Retrieval System) and storage subsystems.</p>
<p>

But it is not just electronic media that are suitable for long-term archiving. For purely securing information, microfilm is still viable, and is now offered in hybrid systems with electronic media and database-supported access. The decisive factor for all long-term storage systems is the timely planning and regular performance of migrations, in order to keep information available in the changing technical landscape. This ongoing process is called Continuous Migration. The "Preserve" components contain special viewers, conversion and migration tools, and long term storage media:</p>

<p>

The "Deliver" components of ECM are used to present information from the "Manage," "Store," and "Preserve" components. They also contain functions used to enter information in systems (such as information transfer to media or generation of formatted output files) or for readying (for example converting or compressing) information for the "Store" and "Preserve" components. Since the AIIM component model is function-based and not to be regarded as an architecture, we can assign these and other components here. The functionality in the "Deliver" category is also known as "output" and summarized under the term "Output Management."</p>
<p>

The "Deliver" components comprise three groups of functions and media: Transformation Technologies, Security Technologies, and Distribution.

Security Technologies</st>
<p>

Security technologies are cross-section functions that are available to all ECM components. For example, electronic signatures are used not only when documents are sent, but also in data capture via scanning, in order to document the completeness of the capture. PKI (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../112/194112.xml">
Public/Private Key Infrastructure</link>) is a basic technology for electronic signatures. It manages keys and certificates, and checks the authenticity of signatures. Other electronic signatures demonstrate the identity of the sender and the integrity of the sent data, i.e. that it is complete and unchanged. In Europe there are three forms of electronic signatures, of different quality and security: simple, advanced, and qualified. In most European states the qualified electronic signature is legally admissible in legal documents and contracts. Finally, there is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/18938226.xml">
Digital Rights Management</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/32921.xml">
Watermark</link>ing. This is used in Content Syndication and in MAM (Media Asset Management) for managing and securing intellectual property rights and copyrights. It works with techniques like electronic watermarks that are integrated directly into the file, and seeks to protect usage rights and protect content that is published on the Internet.</p>

</ss2>

<st>
Distribution</st>
<p>

All of the above technologies basically serve to provide the various contents of an ECM to target users by various routes, in a controlled and user-oriented manner. These can be active components such as e-mail, data media, memos, and passive publication on websites and portals where users can get the information themselves. Possible output and distribution media are:</p>

The former member of the board of directors of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/2124982.xml">
AIIM</link> international, Ulrich Kampffmeyer, states in his whitepaper on ECM in 2004<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>:</p>

<p>

"Document technologies like Enterprise Content Management make traditional data processing complete. They bring together structured, weakly structured, and unstructured information. Every company, every government agency, and every organization must confront the subject. Even if there are no immediate plans to implement such a system, it sneaks into the organization of its own accord &ndash; with the next server licence update, with the next office software suite, with the next database or ERP upgrade. In many companies with heterogeneous IT landscapes, the question of which redundant functionalities of existing products are unused is already more important than whether to invest in a new software system. The most important job is to keep in-house information under control. The questions add up: where to put the thousands and thousands of e-mails, what to do with the electronically signed business correspondence, where to put taxation-relevant data, how to transfer information from the disorganized file system, how to consolidate information in a repository that everybody can use, how to get a single login for all the systems, how to create a uniform in-basket for all incoming information, how to make sure that no information is lost or ignored, etc. etc. Document technologies play an important role in all these questions. ECM solutions are necessary basic components for many applications.</p>
<p>

Every potential user will naturally consider his own individual needs before deciding on a system. However, putting off decisions does not make them less necessary. Every year something supposedly better and easier to use will come along, but waiting will just mean never installing anything. Every time the decision is put off, the mountain of uncontrolled and unused information gets bigger, and known problems get larger. A sensible long-term migration strategy removes the fear of fast technology change. The basic functions of document technology are mature, and most products are reliable, stable, secure, and increasingly affordable. In many industries, the use of document technology makes the difference in staying competitive. ECM — Enterprise Content Management — should be a part of every modern IT infrastructure."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

ECM market development</st>
<p>

Prior to 2003, the ECM market was dominated by a number of medium-sized independent vendors that fell into two categories.  Those who had originated as Document Management companies (<system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

) and begun trying to branch out into managing other types of content such as business documents and rich media.  Larger vendors such as IBM and Oracle also had offerings in this space and the market share remained largely fragmented.</p>
<p>

In 2002, Documentum had added collaboration capabilities with its acquisition of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../408/17403408.xml">
eRoom</link> while Interwoven and Vignette countered with their respective acquisitions of iManage and Intraspect.  Simlarly, Documentum purchased Bulldog for its Digital Asset Management (DAM) capabilities while Interwoven and OpenText countered with acquisitions of <link>
MediaBin</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../099/1312099.xml">
Artesia</link>.  OpenText also acquired European companies <link>
IXOS</link> and <link>
Red Dot</link> to shore up its software portfolio.  </p>
<p>

In October 2003, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/232523.xml">
EMC</link> began a period of market consolidation that continues today with a $1.5B USD acquisition of <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

.  This acquisition led to the creation of a new category, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../083/3331083.xml">
Information Lifecycle Management</link> (ILM) that looked at the management and storage of content holistically from end user to software to middleware, to database with a particular focus on IT governance and management; change control processes; requirements for system availability and recovery times; and service level agreements.  Soon EMC's primarily competitors in the database space responded as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 purchased Stellent in 2006.  OpenText also purchased <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/70649.xml">
Hummingbird</link> in 2006.</p>
<p>

Today, OpenText, Interwoven, and Vignette remain the three primary independent ECM vendors with OpenText far outpacing Interwoven and Vignette in terms of revenue and customer base.  According to CMS Watch, other ECM vendors include IBM's <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">

In early 2007, independent analyst firm CMS Watch cited substantial turbulence among many ECM vendors, suggesting that even some of the biggest players in the market were undergoing significant changes. In addition 2007 has seen the emergence of Open Source options for ECM supplied by Nuxeo, Knowledge Tree and Alfresco, along with S-a-a-S (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../333/2262333.xml">

, estimates that the ECM market is worth approximately $2.9 billion in 2007; this is expected to grow at a <link>
CAGR</link> of 12.9% through 2011. After a plethora of industry consolidation, only three or four major companies are left in this space, and the industry as a whole is undergoing a significant transformation as Microsoft commoditizes content management components.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>. </p>
<p>

According to Gartner, by 2008, 75 percent of Global 2000 companies will have a desktop-focused and a process-focused content management implementation (0.9 probability) and ECM will continue to absorb other technologies, such as digital asset management and e-mail management. Gartner also predicted that there will be further market consolidation, acquisition and separation of vendors into platform and solution providers.</p>
