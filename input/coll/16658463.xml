<b>Monastery Saint Savior</b></p>
<p>

Monastery Saint Savior (in Arabic دير المخلص) was built on a hill covered with pine and olive trees and grape vines and located in the east side of Joun beginning of the eighteenth century, and it constitutes a landmark in the Chouf district.</p>
<p>

Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope</link> site</b></p>
<p>

This site is located on another hill to the north east side of Joun. This site is known as "Dahr El Sitt" (in Arabic ضهر الست).</p>
<p>

Lady <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/279785.xml">
Hester Stanhope</link>, who settled until her death in that residence, said in her memoirs written by her long time friend Doctor Charles Meryon: the residence was on the tip of one of these hills and it was called by the villagers "Dahr El Sitt" or "Dar El Sitt."</p>
<p>

Meryon also said about Lady Stanhope's house on the top of the hill shaped "like half orange". The house had a garden and a stable and other buildings for storage.</p>
<p>

He implied that she liked the house because of its strategic location, "the house on the summit of a conical hill, whence comers and goers might be seen on every side," and the road from Joon to the cities of Sidon, Beirut and Deir El Qamar goes into lonely mountains full of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../188/16188.xml">
jackals</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../702/33702.xml">
wolves</link>.</p>
