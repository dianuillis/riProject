<b>DotHomes.com</b><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> is a real estate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/4059023.xml">
search engine</link>.

Overview</st>
<p>

Referred to as a 'Google of real estate', <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> DotHomes allows home seekers across the US, UK and South Africa to search over thousands of real estate Websites from one place.
Underlying DotHomes' search mechanism is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/233488.xml">
Machine learning</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../253/42253.xml">
data-mining</link> technology, which automatically finds property listings on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/440273.xml">
listing broker</link> / agent Websites, and extracts relevant information. This allows for extremely rapid scaling up of coverage, whilst still getting data directly from source Websites (as opposed to getting data from smaller aggregators).</p>
<p>

DotHomes searches over 176,000 property listings in South Africa; it searches over 472,000 property listings in the UK; it searches over 1.94 million property listings in the US.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

DotHomes employs an advertising business model. It does not charge real estate listing brokers to have their property listings appear in the DotHomes search index. Instead it provides ancillary real estate services with an opportunity to advertise alongside the free "organic" search results.</p>

Data-Mining Technology</st>
<p>

Key to the DotHomes search engine is the ability to extract useful information automatically from thousands of differently formatted real estate Websites - like property addresses (as contrasted with the addresses of associated estate agents), postcodes (rather than JavaScript strings), property descriptions (rather than disclaimers), etc. Traditionally a unique extraction engine is written for every Website which needs to be handled. To scale the extraction process to handle thousands of differently formatted Websites DotHomes employs a proprietary machine learning framework for extraction.</p>
<p>

The DotHomes extraction engine is a wholly automated daemonic, multi-threaded, <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/23862.xml">
Python (programming language)</link></programming_language>
 process.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> The engine operates in three distinct modes, each of which utilises a custom embedded DSL (<link>
Domain-Specific Language</link>). The first of these modes provides statistical analysis over a collection of similar documentsâ€”considering node variance, structural robustness, etc. The information garnered during this mode feeds into a multi-tiered machine-learning framework of heuristics - heuristics which concern absolute node position, relative position, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/279688.xml">
pattern matching</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/1331441.xml">
text classification</link>, <link>
part of speech tagging</link>, consistency between information candidates, etc. This framework constitutes the second extraction engine mode. The result of running the extraction engine in this second mode is a collection of expressions, given in the DSL, which detail the probability of an attribute being within a particular node, or node subset, taking a particular form, being on a page with a particular crawl path, etc. These compound expressions are then used, in the third extraction engine mode, to perform the actual extraction of relevant information.</p>

Born out of Imperial College London</st>
<p>

DotHomes is the first search engine to be launched by London-based search company, BytePlay Limited. BytePlay was founded in mid-2006 by Artemi Krymski and Douglas de Jager, two young Computing alumni of <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/61116.xml">
Imperial College London</link></university>
. Krymski and de Jager jointly serve as managing directors of BytePlay. In mid-2007 Anthony Morgan, also an Imperial Computing alumnus, joined Krymski and de Jager in the management of BytePlay as CTO. BytePlay/DotHomes was the first leading Web startup to be affiliated to <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.imperialentrepreneurs.com/">
Imperial Entrepreneurs</weblink>. Recent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../533/1666533.xml">
YCombinator</link> startup SnapTalent is also an affiliate of Imperial Entrepreneurs.</p>
