Lyrics</st>
<p>

The song uses a reptitive chanting of the phrase "Remember that day, that day, that day"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> as its chorus in memory of September 11th, and the attacks that clearly resonanted across the world. Both MC's in the group, K Dub Shine and Zeebra deliver verses that urge the world to question not "what, where, who, but why" the attacks happen. K Dub Shine masterfully ends his verse with a critique of the Bush administration, saying "It's always civilians who are sacrificed, even so, Bush sleeps in his bed tonight." The lyrics as well as a music video can be found at http://web.mit.edu/condry/www/jhh/mov/KG-911-small.mov.</p>

Cultural Analysis of "911 Song"</st>
<p>

While it may seem interesting that one of the main Japanese hip-hop groups has released a single about a terrorist attack in the United States, this attention to the United States, especially New York, should come as no surprise. Japanese hip hop draws incredible homage to the United States for its rap culture and its African-American culture. Youth in Japan have even been known to darken their faces, in a style known as burapan, to mimic the look and style of blacks in America.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> However, as the lyrics of the song show, Japanese hip-hop heads are not simply going for the look of black youth, they have a message, and often a politically charged message, that falls into lockstep, (or rhythm) with black youth. King Giddra was not the only Japanese hip-hop group to criticize the American government for the terrorist attacks; <musician wordnetid="110340312" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

, and countless other groups have released songs in the wake of 911. While Japan may be overlooked for its hip-hop abilites, even mocked, Japanese hip-hop groups are beginning to establish their own style, with the help of African-American culture, that is politically charged and progressive.</p>
