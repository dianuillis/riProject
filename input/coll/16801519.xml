, stood two or more storeys high. They were built with ramps, rather than staircases, to provide easy access to the upper floors. Grain horrea had their ground floor raised on pillars to reduce the likelihood of damp getting in and spoiling the goods. Many horrea appear to have served as great trading areas with rows of small shops (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/8335561.xml">
taberna</link>e</it>) off a central courtyard; some may have been fairly elaborate, perhaps serving as the equivalent of modern shopping arcades. Others, such as those in Ostia, dispensed with the courtyard and instead had rows of <it>tabernae</it> standing back-to-back. In the <system wordnetid="108435388" confidence="0.8">

, horrea took a very different design with a single row of very deep <it>tabernae</it>, all opening onto the same side; this reflected an architectural style that was widely followed in the region's palaces and temple complexes, well before the arrival of the Romans.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> </p>
<p>

Unsurprisingly, security and fire protection were major concerns. Horrea were frequently built with very thick walls (as much as 1 m / 3 ft thick) to reduce the danger of fire, and the windows were always narrow and placed high up on the wall to deter theft. Doors were protected with elaborate systems of locks and bolts. Even the largest horrea usually only had two or three external doors, which were often quite narrow and would not have permitted the entrance of carts. The arduous task of moving goods into, out of and around horrea was most probably carried out by manual labour alone; the biggest horrea would thus have had an enormous staff of labourers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

Roman horrea were individually named, some having names indicating the commodities they stored (and probably sold), such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/58256.xml">
wax</link> (<it>candelaria</it>), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/16861908.xml">
paper</link> (<it>chartaria</it>) and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../995/38995.xml">
pepper</link> (<it>piperataria</it>). Others were named after emperors or other individuals connected with the imperial family, such as the aforementioned Horrea Galbae, which were apparently named after the 1st century AD emperor <emperor wordnetid="110053004" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
