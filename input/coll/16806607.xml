Also known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../607/16806607.xml">

UPV Cebu High School is located in Gorordo Avenue, Lahug, Cebu City, Philippines.</p>

History</st>
<p>

UP Cebu College was established on May 3, 1918 after the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines approved the formal petition for a branch of UP in Cebu. It was then known as the Junior College of Liberal Arts.  Three years later, the Junior College of Liberal Arts became a separate unit of the University and was renamed the Junior College of the UP.</p>
<p>

World War II brought about the closure of the College. It reopened in 1947 with only 56 students: 20 were enrolled in the third year and 36 in the fourth year. During the graduation exercises for the school year 1949-1950, 17 graduates received their high school diplomas.</p>
<p>

The College had to close for the second time when its appropriation was omitted from the 1950-51 Appropriations Act.</p>
<p>

Although the College reopened in 1963, it was only on May 31, 1972 that the Board of Regents authorized the establishment of a high school at the University of the Philippines in Cebu.  This high school was intended as a feeder for the College and as a laboratory for the graduate students. Nine teachers and a guidance counselor composed the high school staff. There were only 151 first and second year students.</p>
<p>

On January 1, 1986, UP Cebu College, UP Iloilo College, and UP Tacloban College, officially became part of the UP in the Visayas, an autonomous unit within the UP System.</p>
<p>

On January 10, 1989, the UP Board of Regents adopted the policy of democratized admission for students in the high schools of the UP in the Visayas (Cebu and Iloilo). Under this concept, the high schools of the UPV offer a program to help economically disadvantaged but intellectually deserving students gain access to tertiary-level education, especially within the UP System.  UP High School Cebu then followed the Enriched General Curriculum.</p>
<p>

From June, 2002, until the present, UPV Cebu High School has been following the same Special Science Curriculum as that followed by the UPV Iloilo High School.</p>

Mandate to Democratized Access to Education</st>

<p>

In the late 1980s, UPV Cebu High School was under threat of closure due to budget issues.  To avert this threat, the school adopted a policy of democratized admission for students in the high schools of the UP System.  This was initially implemented in during the school year 1989-90 and was fully implemented during the school year 1990-91.</p>
<p>

Under this concept, "every high school in UP is a program for helping economically disadvantaged but deserving students gain access to tertiary level education in UP."  Pursuant to this policy, UPV Cebu High School admits first year students from low-income families. As such, the high school is an experimental laboratory for innovative teaching strategies designed to better prepare these deserving students for access to tertiary education, particularly in the UP System where they can avail of subsidized education through the socialized tuition program.</p>

Campus Life</st>
