The <b>International Identity Federation</b> (www.idfed.org) was formed in Scotland during 2006.     IDFed provides a web-based solution to the problem of identification of injured or distressed travellers. Members are issued with a unique number embossed onto an identity tag or bracelet.  They use a forum to log their movements and this relates back to a secure data base controlled by a 24 hour monitoring service. In the event of a member being found helpless, the 18 digit unique number (created using an algorithm) is used to inform next of kin or employers and aid in the treatment and/or repatriation of the member.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> For those undertaking particularly hazardour or dangerous journeys, DNA profiling is also offered through a UK Department of Justice approved specialist DNA laboratory based at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.
