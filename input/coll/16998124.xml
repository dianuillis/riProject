The <b>Military Health System</b> is the enterprise within the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

dependents</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  The mission of the Military Health System (MHS) is to provide health support for the full range of military operations and sustain the health of all who are entrusted to MHS care.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><p>

The primary mission of the medical services system is to maintain the health of military personnel, so they can carry out their military missions, and to be prepared to deliver health care required during wartime.  Often described as the medical readiness mission, this effort involves medical testing and screening of recruits, emergency medical treatment of servicemen and women involved in hostilities, and the maintenance of physical standards of those in the armed services.  In support of those in uniform, the military medical system also provides, where space is available, health care services to dependents of active duty service members. Space available care is also provided to retirees and their dependents.  Some former spouses are also included.  Since 1966 civilian medical care for dependents of active duty personnel, and for retirees and their dependents who are under age 65 has been available (with certain limitations and co-payments) through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and its successor, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/2996627.xml">
TRICARE</link>.  Since October 2001 TRICARE benefits have also been available to retirees and their dependents aged 65 and over.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

In Fiscal Year 2007, the MHS had total budget authority of $39.4 billion and served approximately 9.1 million beneficiaries, including Active Duty personnel and their families and retirees and their families.  The MHS includes 133,000 personnel, 86,000 military and 47,000 civilian, working at more than 1,000 locations worldwide, including 70 inpatient facilities and 1,085 medical, dental, and veterinary clinics.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

, medical care in the military was provided largely as a function of the regimental surgeon and surgeons mates.  While further attempts were made to establish a centralized medical system, care provision was largely local and limited.  The availability of effective treatment for disease and injury was, by modern standards, primitive.  Significant changes began to occur near the time of the Civil War, when improvements in medical science, communications and transportation made centralized casualty collection and treatment more practical. </p>

 expanded and developed greater organization and structure.  Care began on the battlefield and was then transferred to successively greater levels of medical capability.  Considerable medical service capability was located in the combat theater.  This capability was to ensure the availability of needed care, and to help maintain combat unit strength by returning soldiers to duty if their condition could be effectively treated in theater.

Changes in the perception of health care in the post World War II era and an assessment of medical services provided to dependents caused <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
Congress</link></legislature>
 to re-evaluate the dependent health care benefit in the late 1950s.  At that point changes in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/31256.xml">
tax law</link> had induced business and industry to begin offering a health care benefit as an employment <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/422023.xml">
incentive</link>.  A 1956 Department of Defense estimate was that 40 percent of active duty dependents did not have access to federal facilities due to distance, incomplete medical coverage at the federal facility, or due to the saturation of services at military treatment facilities.  Congress responded by passing the Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 and the Military Medical Benefits Amendments of 1966.  These acts created the program know as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/2996627.xml">
Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services</link> (CHAMPUS).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

In the late 1980s, because of escalating costs, claims paperwork demands and general beneficiary dissatisfaction, DOD initiated a series of demonstration projects.  Under a program known as the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI), a contractor provided both health care and administrative-related services, including claims processing.  The CRI project was one of the first to introduce managed care features to the CHAMPUS program.  Beneficiaries under CRI were offered three choices&nbsp;&ndash;  a health maintenance organization-like option called CHAMPUS Prime that required enrollment and offered enhanced benefits and low-cost shares, a preferred provider organization-like option called CHAMPUS Extra that required use of network providers in exchange for lower cost shares, and the standard CHAMPUS option that continued the freedom of choice in selecting providers and higher cost shares and deductibles.</p>
<p>

Although DOD’s initial intent under CRI was to award three competitively bid contracts covering six states, only one bid, made by Foundation Health Corporation (now <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../782/912782.xml">

) covering <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/5407.xml">

 and <symbol wordnetid="106806469" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../270/13270.xml">
Hawaii</link></symbol>
, was received.  Foundation delivered services under this contract between August 1988 and January 1994.</p>
<p>

In late 1993, in response to requirements in the DOD Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1994, the DOD announced plans for implementing a nationwide managed care program for the MHS that would be completely implemented by May 1997.  Under this program, known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/2996627.xml">

 would be divided into 12 health care regions.  An administrative organization, the lead agent, was designated for each region and coordinated the health care needs of all military treatment facilities in the region.  Under TRICARE, seven managed care support contracts were awarded covering DOD’s 12 health care regions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
