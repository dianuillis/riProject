History</st>

<p>

Cruets may be traced back to the Biblical use of a "cruse of oil," a jug or jar to hold liquid (i.e. I Kings 17:16). Some speculate that the early use of cruets was ecclesiastical . A few cruets dating from medieval times still exist today. Its culinary use however was first introduced in the late 17th century. Cardinal Mazzarino had a pair of salad cruets on his dining table at his home in France. One cruet was for olive oil and the other for vinegar, these became indispensable partner decanter pieces. The use of oil and vinegar cruets rapidly spread throughout Italy, where oil and vinegar were already in frequent use. Today on most Italian tables, cruets are ever present.</p>

Types</st>
<p>

Cruets range from nominal decanters to the highly decorative cut-crystal. Some cruets are unusual, and can either be intended to be ornamental or functional.</p>
<p>

During some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/18337522.xml">
Christian</link> religious ceremonies, cruets are used to keep wine and water for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../767/9767.xml">
Eucharist</link>. These cruets are usually made of glass, though sometimes they are made of precious metals such as gold or silver. Cruets specifically intended for religious ceremonies come in pairs: one to contain water, often marked <it>A</it> for <it>Aqua</it>, and one to contain wine , <it>V</it> for <it>Vinum</it>. (These two liquids are mixed during the ceremony.)</p>
