The <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../706/3407706.xml">
environmental policy</link> of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/3434750.xml">
United States</link></b> is federal governmental action to regulate activities that have an environmental impact in the United States.  The goal of environmental policy is to protect the environment for future generations while interfering as little as possible with the efficiency of commerce or the liberty of the people and to limit inequity in who is burdened with environmental costs.  This policy grew mainly out of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/10183.xml">
environmental movement in the United States</link> in the 1960s and '70's during which several environmental laws were passed, regulating air and water pollution and forming the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../666/58666.xml">
Environmental Protection Agency</link></agency>
 (EPA).  Partially due to the high costs associated with these regulations, there has been a backlash from business and politically <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/6675.xml">
conservative</link> interests, limiting increases to environmental regulatory budgets and slowing efforts to protect the environment.  Since the 1970s, despite frequent legislative gridlock, there have been significant achievements in environmental regulation, including increases in air and water quality and to a lesser degree, control of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/38031.xml">
hazardous waste</link>. Due to increasing scientific consensus on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/5042951.xml">
global warming</link> and political pressure from environmental groups, modifications to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../167/3967167.xml">
United States energy policy</link> and limits on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/37259.xml">
greenhouse gas</link> emission have been proposed, but such efforts have made limited progress.
<sec>
<st>
Policy tools</st>
<p>

The two major policy tools for protecting the environment are rules and inducements.  The United States has chosen to use rules, primarily through regulation.  Such regulation can come in the form of <b>design standards</b> and <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/652195.xml">
performance standards</link></b>.  Performance standards specify emission levels and let those covered by the rules decide how those levels will be met. Design standards specify exactly how performance standards will be met.</p>
<p>

Alternatively, the government can use inducements, or <b>market reform</b>.  Inducements are rewards and punishments used to influence people or groups.  The two major types of market reforms are charge systems, such as <politics wordnetid="113840719" confidence="0.8">

</politics>
, and <b><idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

</plan_of_action>
</plan>
</idea>
</b>.  One type of tradable permit system is an <b>auction of pollution rights</b> in which the amount of allowed pollution is set and divided into units, which are then auctioned, giving environmental organizations the opportunity to buy the units to create a cleaner environment than originally planned.  Such a plan was implemented for SO2 emissions in the 1990 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/7574401.xml">
Acid Rain Program</link> and has been undertaken for greenhouse gases on a regional scale as a way to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../179/2119179.xml">

<p>

Governmental authority on environmental issues in the United States is highly fragmented.  While the EPA is the most comprehensive environmental agency, its authority on these matters is not absolute.  Virtually all of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../238/274238.xml">
executive branch's departments</link> have some area of environmental authority.  This contributes somewhat to the cost and questionable efficacy of the United States' environmental regulation.

Fragmentation within the executive branch is duplicated in Congress and within the states.  The EPA is the concern of almost two-thirds of the <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/19468510.xml">
House of Representatives</link></legislature>
' standing committees and subcommittees and a similar percentage in the <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/19592407.xml">
Senate</link></legislature>
.  Some seventy committees and subcommittees control water quality policy, for example.  Such fragmentation creates both opportunities and problems.  While such a variety of committees provide enormous access for environmentalist and industry groups to lobby, the division of tasks means that no one committee or agency looks at environmental problems as a whole.

, the ineffectiveness and criticism of the 1960s Clean Air and Clean Water acts gave a burgeoning momentum to the environmental movement.</p>
<p>

In addition to growing public support, structural changes such as Congressional reform and new access to the courts gave environmentalists new power to enact change.  The movement that formed held three key values: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/156286.xml">
ecology</link>, health, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../531/18413531.xml">
sustainability</link>. These values- that we depend and are interconnected with the environment, that insults to the environment can affect our health, and that we should limit our dependence on non-renewable resources- along with a uniquely sympathetic president and Congress, led to great environmental policy change in the 1970s.</p>

 which oversaw the environmental impact of federal actions.  Later in the year, Nixon created the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/4877518.xml">
Environmental Protection Agency</link> (EPA), which consolidated environmental programs from other agencies into a single entity.  The legislation during this period concerned primarily first-generation pollutants in the air, surface water, groundwater, and solid waste disposal.  Air pollutants such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/286688.xml">
particulates</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/50958.xml">
sulfur dioxide</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/238528.xml">

carbon monoxide</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../718/22718.xml">

acid rain</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../418/1796418.xml">
visibility</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/5042951.xml">
global warming</link> were also concerns.  In surface water, the contaminants of concern were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../360/1096360.xml">
dissolved oxygen</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/9028799.xml">
bacteria</link>, suspended and dissolved solids, nutrients, and toxic substances such as metals.  For groundwater, the pollutants included biological contaminants, inorganic and organic substances, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/37245.xml">
radionuclide</link>s.  Finally, solid waste contaminants from agriculture, industry, mining, municipalities, and others were put under control.</p>
<p>

The Clean Air Act amendments of 1970 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972 moved environmental concerns in a new direction.  The standards that they put in place were unattainable with existing technology- they were technology forcing.  The standards that the EPA put into place called mainly for state implementation.  Each state prepared state implementation plans (SIPs), requiring EPA approval, and each state had to request permits from the EPA to emit pollution into any surface water.  Congress also provided for a massive public works program to assist in the construction of water and waste treatment plants for municipalities.  The 1970 Clean Air Act also enacted deadlines and penalties for automobile emission standards in new cars, resulting in the development and adoption of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../802/286802.xml">
catalytic converter</link>s and greatly reducing automobile pollution.</p>

(R-MI)- that called for drastic changes in environmental regulation, primarily through administrative changes.  In pursuit of this strategy, Reagan gradually reduced the EPA's budget by 30% through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, cut the number of EPA employees, and appointed people at key agency positions who would enthusiastically follow the administration line.  Appointees such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/2057901.xml">
Anne Burford</link> at the EPA and <official wordnetid="110372373" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

James G. Watt</link></official>
 at the Department of the Interior were overtly hostile to environmental protection.  Through his appointments, Reagan changed the operations of environmental protection from stiff regulation to "cooperative regulation".</p>
<p>

Under this administrative strategy of regulatory relief, environmental laws were written and interpreted more favorably for industry interests.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../030/44030.xml">
Office of Management and Budget</link>(OMB) was also given new powers to write regulations.  During the first Reagan administration, the OMB was given the power to require a favorable cost-benefit analysis of any regulation before it could be implemented.  This was used to delay new regulations, and changes that resulted in regulatory relief often had this requirement waived.  At the beginning of the second Reagan administration, the OMB was given more power- all regulatory agencies were required to submit proposals each year for all major environmental regulation- allowing it to reduce regulatory efforts before such proposed regulations became public.</p>

) was formed in 1989 to play the same role as the previous Task Force on Regulatory Relief that Bush had served on in the Reagan administration, which was to negotiate on behalf of the president for regulatory relief with the heads of federal agencies <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. This executive branch agency negotiated with EPA director Reilly, leading to industry-favorable rulings such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/102024.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22United_States%22])">
redefinition of wetlands</link> and the allowance of untreated toxic chemicals in local landfills (this was later reversed).  While previous regulatory-relief efforts, such as Reagan's use of the Office of Budget Management, were subject to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../068/3263068.xml">

Issues</st>
<p>

Since the environmental movement of the 1970s, the nature of environmental issues has changed.  While the initial emphasis was on conventional air and water pollutants, which were the most obvious and easily measurable problems, newer issues are long-term problems that are not easily discernible and can be surrounded by controversy.
</p>
<ss1>
<st>
Acid Deposition</st>
<p>

Acid deposition, in the form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/3263.xml">
acid rain</link> and dry deposition, is the result of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/50958.xml">
sulfur</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/238528.xml">
nitrogen dioxide</link> being emitted into the air, traveling and landing in a different place, and changing the acidity of the water or land on which the chemicals fall.  Acid deposition in the Northeast United States from the burning of coal and in the West United States from utilities and motor vehicles caused <link>
a number of problems</link>, and was partially exacerbated by the Clean Air Act, which forced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../443/1560443.xml">
coal power plant</link>s to use taller <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/238377.xml">
smoke stack</link>s, resulting in farther transmission of sulfur dioxide in the air.</p>
<p>

During the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/2203961.xml">
Carter</link> administration, the United States undertook a <b>risk-averse</b> policy, acting through the EPA and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to research and control the pollutants suspected to cause acid deposition even in the face of scientific uncertainty.  The Reagan administration was more <b>risk tolerant</b>.  It argued that, given the scientific uncertainties about harm and exposure levels, new expenditures should not be undertaken that would curtail <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/9560337.xml">
energy security</link> and economic growth.  During George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign, he called for new Clean Air Act legislation to curtail sulfur- and nitrogen-dioxide emissions.  In 1990, after he was elected, amendments to the Clean Air Act were finally passed that cut emissions by over 12 million tons per year, set up a market-like system of emissions trading, and set a cap on emissions for the year 2000.  These goals were achieved to some degree by the installation of industrial <link>
scrubbers</link>.</p>
<p>

While the initial costs in cutting emissions levels were expected to be over $4.6 billion for utilities and a 40% rise in electricity costs, the impact ended up being only about $1 billion and a 2-4% rise in electricity costs.  Part of the reason for the relatively-low costs is the availability of low-sulfur <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../987/5987.xml">
coal</link>.</p>

, and a third agreement in 1990 in London.  In the United States, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments phased out production of CFCs and required recycling of CFC products.</p>
<p>

Although the phase-out of CFCs took almost two decades, the policy is generally seen as a success.  While a crisis seems to be averted, due to the longevity of CFC particles in the atmosphere, the ozone layer is only expected to start showing sign of recovery by the year 2024.</p>

, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/323737.xml">
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act</link> (CERCLA, or Superfund) was enacted in 1980 to assist in the cleanup of abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites.  In the mid-1980s, the <link>
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments</link> (1984) and the <link>
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act</link> (1986) were passed.</p>
<p>

The aim of hazardous waste regulation is to prevent harm from occurring due to hazardous waste and to pass the burdens of cleanup of hazardous waste on to the original producers of the waste.  Some of the problems of hazardous waste regulation are that the negative effects of hazardous waste can be difficult to detect and controversial and that, due mainly to the large amount of hazardous waste that is generated (214 million tons in 1995), regulation can be difficult and costly.</p>
<p>

Implementation has been difficult, with years sometimes passing between legislation passage and initial regulations.  Superfund was passed in December 1980, just before Reagan took office.  The first administrator of Superfund was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/3635329.xml">
Rita Lavelle</link> who had worked for a major hazardous waste generator.  The result was that her implementation of Superfund was designed mainly to delay regulation, and the subsequent controversy resulted in the resignation of Lavelle, EPA administrator <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/2057901.xml">
Anne Burford</link>, and several other top EPA personnel.  In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, increasing funding to $9 billion and providing for studies and new technologies.  By 1995, Superfund cleanup still took an average of twelve years per site, and costs for each site can range in the billions of dollars.  Superfund, while showing improvements, has been probably the most criticized of environmental programs based on costs of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/406260.xml">
remediation</link>, implementation problems, and the questionable seriousness of the problems it addresses.</p>

Risk Control Policy</st>
<p>

Underlying the policy decisions made by the United States is the concept of risk control, consisting of two parts: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/219072.xml">
risk assessment</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../404/26404.xml">
risk management</link>.  The science behind risk assessment varies greatly in uncertainty and tends to be the focus of political controversy.  For example, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/175596.xml">
animal testing</link> is often used to determine the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/170567.xml">
toxicity</link> of various substances for humans.  But assumptions made about expected dosage and exposure to chemicals are often disputed, and the dosage given to animals is typically much larger than what humans normally consume.  While industry groups tend to take a risk-tolerant position, environmentalists take a risk-averse position, following the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/50354.xml">
precautionary principle</link>.</p>
<p>

Another issue is the effect that chemicals can have relative to lifestyle choices.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
Cancer</link>, for example, typically surface decades after first exposure to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/6445.xml">
carcinogen</link>, and lifestyle choices are frequently more important in causing cancer than exposure to chemicals.  While the governmental role in mitigating lifestyle-choice risks can be very controversial (see <link>
Smoking in the United States</link>), chemical exposure through lifestyle choices can also occur involuntarily if the public is not properly educated (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../152/903152.xml">
Endocrine disruptor</link>s).</p>
<p>

Finally, the way that threats are presented to the public plays a large role in how those threats are addressed.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/10638591.xml">
threat of nuclear power</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../351/16534351.xml">
environmental effects of pesticides</link> are overstated, some have claimed, while many high-priority threats go unpublicized.  In order to combat this discrepancy, the EPA published a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/2622159.xml">
Relative Risk</link> Report in 1987, and a follow-up report published by the Relative Risk Reduction Strategies Committee in 1990 suggested that the EPA should adopt a more pro-active posture, educating the public and assigning budgetary priorities for objectively-assessed high-risk threats.</p>

Since the major environmental legislation of the 1970s was enacted, great progress has been made in some areas, but the environmental protection has come at a high price.  Between 1970 and 1996, air pollutants dropped 32% while the population grew by 29%.  While air and water standards have been slowly improving, in 1996 70 million people still lived in counties that didn't meet EPA ozone standards.  36% of rivers and 39% of lakes didn't meet minimum standards for all uses (swimming, fishing, drinking, supporting aquatic life).  In the same period, the size of the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../535/161535.xml">
National Park Service</link></agency>
 grew from 26,000,000&nbsp;acres (110,000&nbsp;km2) to 83,000,000&nbsp;acres (340,000&nbsp;km2), and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/75289.xml">
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</link> expanded by over three times to manage over 92,000,000&nbsp;acres (370,000&nbsp;km2).  In 1995, 41% of the 960 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/9556.xml">
endangered species</link> are stable or improving.  </p>
<p>

The overall cost of environmental regulation in the United States is estimated to be about 2% of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/12594.xml">
gross domestic product</link>-similar to many other countries, but calculating the cost is challenging both conceptually (deciding what costs are included) and practically (with data from a broad range of sources).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In 1994, almost $122 billion was spent on pollution abatement and control.  $35 billion of that has been in direct government spending, $65 billion was spent by business, and $22 billion was spent by individuals.  Critics of environmental legislation argue that the gains made in environmental protection come at too great a cost.  The cost of meeting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../123/227123.xml">
OSHA</link> workplace exposure standards, for example, can be as high as $3 million per life-year for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../186/18582186.xml">
benzene</link> protection in coke and coal factories or $51 million per life-year for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/897.xml">
arsenic</link> protection in glass manufacturing plants.  Due to these large costs, non-compliance with environmental rules is rampant in some areas, such as water pollution.</p>
