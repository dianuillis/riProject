<b>Disease management</b> is the concept of reducing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../925/261925.xml">
healthcare</link> costs and/or improving quality of life for individuals with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../272/4421272.xml">
chronic disease</link> conditions by preventing or minimizing the effects of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/8072.xml">
disease</link>, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. It is also often known as: demand management, health management programs, or disease self-management.

 Background </st>
<p>

Disease management has evolved from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../870/1183870.xml">
managed care</link>, specialty capitation, and health service <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/2234277.xml">
demand management</link>, and refers to the processes and people concerned with improving or maintaining health in large populations. As opposed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/66997.xml">
epidemiology</link>, which is generally concerned with sudden or persistent virulent outbreaks of disease, it is concerned with common <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/157293.xml">
chronic</link> illnesses, and the reduction of future complications associated with those diseases. See also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/14441062.xml">
chronic care management</link>.</p>
<p>

Illnesses that disease management would concern itself with would include: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../735/5069735.xml">
Coronary heart disease</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/284027.xml">
kidney failure</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/77432.xml">
hypertension</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../930/249930.xml">
heart failure</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/56435.xml">
obesity</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/44677.xml">
diabetes mellitus</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../905/44905.xml">
asthma</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/1776.xml">
arthritis</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/8389.xml">
clinical depression</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/28445.xml">
sleep apnea</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../461/22461.xml">
osteoporosis</link>, and other common ailments.</p>
<p>

In the United States, disease management is a large industry with many vendors. It is of particular importance to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">
health plan</link>s, agencies, trusts, associations and <link>
employer</link>s who offer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">
health insurance</link>. A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../689/13294689.xml">
Mercer Consulting</link> study indicated that the percentage of employer-sponsored health plans offering disease management programs grew to 58% in 2003, up from 41% in 2002.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

The underlying premise of disease management is that when the right tools, experts, and equipment are applied to a population, then labor costs (specifically: absenteeism, presenteeism, and direct insurance expenses) can be minimized in the near term, or resources can be provided more efficiently. The general idea is to ease the disease path, rather than cure the disease. Improving quality and activities for daily living are first and foremost. Improving cost, in some programs, is a necessary component, as well. However, some disease management systems believe that reductions in longer term problems may not be measureable today, but may warrant continuation of disease management programs until better data is available in 10-20 years. Most disease management vendors offer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../956/3440956.xml">
return on investment</link> (ROI) for their programs, although over the years there have been dozens of ways to measure ROI. Responding to this inconsistency, an industry trade association, , convened industry leaders to develop consensus guidelines for measuring clinical and financial outcomes in disease management, wellness and other population-based programs. Contributing to the work were public and private health and quality organizations, including the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, URAC and the Joint Commission. The project produced the first volume of a now three-volume Outcomes Guidelines Report, which details industry-consensus approaches to measuring outcomes.</p>

Tools include web-based assessment tools, clinical guidelines, health risk assessments, outbound and inbound call-center-based triage, best practices, formularies, and numerous other devices, systems and protocols.  </p>
