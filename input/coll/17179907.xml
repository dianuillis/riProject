<b>Louis B. Mendelsohn</b>, a pioneer in the application of personal computers to the financial markets, is President and Chief Executive Officer of Market Technologies, LLC, which he founded in 1979 to develop technical analysis trading software for use by commodity futures traders. </p>

<st>
 Biography </st>

<p>

Mendelsohn began trading individual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../096/294096.xml">
stocks</link> in the early 1970s, followed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../073/9272073.xml">
stock options</link>.  Then, in the late 1970s, while working as a hospital administrator, he switched to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/48218.xml">
commodities</link>, as both a day and position trader, and began utilizing personal computers in his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../577/112577.xml">
technical analysis</link> research.  </p>
<p>

In 1980 he left the hospital administration industry to trade full-time and continue his research at applying personal computers to technical analysis. Three years later, Mr. Mendelsohn pioneered the first commercially available strategy back-testing and optimization trading software for personal computers.  By the mid-1980s these capabilities had become the standard in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/497775.xml">
technical analysis software</link> for both stock and futures traders. </p>
<p>

Recognizing the emerging trend toward globalization of the world's financial markets, in 1986 Mendelsohn again broke new ground in technical analysis when he developed the first commercial intermarket analysis software in the financial industry for personal computers. </p>
<p>

Building on his extensive research in the 1980s involving intermarket analysis, in 1991 Mendelsohn released VantagePoint Intermarket Analysis Software, which makes short term market forecasts based upon the pattern recognition capabilities of <link>
neural networks</link>.</p>
<p>

Since then, Mendelsohn's research has continued to focus on intermarket analysis and market forecasting.  Mendelsohn has written extensively since 1983 in many prominent financial publications including <it>Barron's</it>, <it>Futures</it>, and <it>Technical Analysis of Stocks &amp; Commodities</it>.  He has been widely quoted in the financial media including the <it>Wall Street Journal</it> and <it>Investor's Business Daily</it>, has collaborated on more than half a dozen books on technical analysis, and has been interviewed live on national radio and television, including CNNfn, Bloomberg Television, and CNBC.  Mendelsohn's first book, <it>Trend Forecasting with Technical Analysis: Unleashing the Hidden Power of Intermarket Analysis to Beat the Market</it>, was released in December 2000. A second edition, <it>Trend Forecasting with Technical Analysis: Predicting Global Markets with Intermarket Analysis</it>, was released in early 2008. Another book, <it>Forex Trading Using Intermarket Analysis: Discovering Hidden Market Relationships That Provide Early Clues For Price Direction</it>, was released in March 2006.</p>
