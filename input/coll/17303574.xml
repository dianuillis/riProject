An <b>ecological network</b> is a representation of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../244/240244.xml">
biotic interactions</link> in an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/9632.xml">
ecosystem</link>, in which species (nodes) are connected by pairwise interactions (links).  These interactions can be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../772/145772.xml">
trophic</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/51483.xml">
mutualistic</link>.  Ecological networks are used to describe and compare the structures of real ecosystems, while network models are used to investigate the effects of network structure on properties such as ecosystem stability.

 Properties of ecological networks </st>
<p>

Historically, research into ecological networks developed from descriptions of trophic relationships in aquatic food webs; however, recent work has expanded to look at other food webs as well as webs of mutualists.  Results of this work have identified several important properties of ecological networks.</p>
<p>

<b>Complexity</b> (linkage density): the average number of links per species.  Explaining the observed high levels of complexity in ecosystems<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> has been one of the main challenges and motivations for ecological network analysis, since early theory predicted that complexity should lead to instability<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>.</p>
<p>

<b>Connectance</b>: the proportion of possible links between species that are realized (links/species2).  In food webs, the level of connectance is related to the statistical distribution of the links per species.  The distribution of links changes from (partial) power-law to exponential to uniform as the level of connectance increases<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>.  </p>
<p>

<b>Clustering</b>: the proportion of species that are directly linked to a focal species.  A focal species in the middle of a cluster may be a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../342/230342.xml">
keystone species</link>, and its loss could have large effects on the network.</p>
<p>

<b>Compartmentalization</b>: the division of the network into relatively independent sub-networks.  Some ecological networks have been observed to be compartmentalized by body size<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> and by spatial location<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.</p>
<p>

<b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../108/3464108.xml">
Nestedness</link></b>: the degree to which species with few links have a sub-set of the links of other species, rather than a different set of links.  In highly nested networks, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../575/11147575.xml">
guilds</link> of species that share an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../244/67244.xml">
ecological niche</link> contain both generalists (species with many links) and specialists (species with few links, all shared with the generalists).  In mutualistic networks, nestedness is often asymmetrical, with specialists of one guild linked to the generalists of the partner guild<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>.</p>

<st>
 Stability of ecological networks </st>
<p>

The relationship between ecosystem complexity and stability is a major topic of interest in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../630/9630.xml">
ecology</link>.  Use of ecological networks makes it possible to analyze the effects of the network properties described above on the stability of an ecosystem.  Ecosystem complexity was once thought to reduce stability by enabling the effects of disturbances, such as species loss or species invasion, to spread and amplify through the network.  However, other characteristics of network structure have been identified that reduce the spread of indirect effects and thus enhance ecosystem stability.  Interaction strength may decrease with the number of links between species, damping the effects of any disturbance<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> and cascading extinctions are less likely in compartmentalized networks, as effects of species losses are limited to the original compartment<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>.  Furthermore, as long as the most connected species are unlikely to go extinct, stability increases with connectance<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> and nestedness<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>.  </p>

 Other applications </st>
<p>

Additional applications of ecological networks include exploration of how the community context affects pairwise interactions.  The community of species in an ecosystem is expected to affect both the ecological interaction and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../835/190835.xml">
coevolution</link> of pairs of species.  Related, spatial applications are being developed for studying <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/1260217.xml">
metapopulations</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/66997.xml">
epidemiology</link>, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../105/4839105.xml">
evolution of cooperation</link>.  In these cases, networks of habitat patches (metapopulations) or individuals (epidemiology, social behavior), make it possible to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity.</p>
