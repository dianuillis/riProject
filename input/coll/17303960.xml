<b>Plastic pipework</b> standards for the conveyance of drinking water,waste water, chemicals, heating and cooling fluids, foodstuffs, ultra-pure liquids, slurries, gases, compressed air and vacuum system applications. Plastic Pressure Pipe Systems have many advantages to offer to the designer, installer and end user of pipe systems; they are light weight, easier to install than metal piping systems, faster to install as well as being more cost effective than metal piping systems. They are used for both above and below ground applications. A well installed and well maintained Plastic Pressure Pipe System could have a life cycle of up to 50 years. This is dependent upon the medium, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../300/19572300.xml">
temperature</link>, chemical consistency, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/23619.xml">
pressure</link> and type of plastic pressure pipe system selected. Plastic Pressure Pipe Systems have been in use since the 1950s.<p>

The most common Plastic Pressure Pipe Systems are:</p>

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)</st>

<p>

ABS is suitable for the conveyance of potable water, slurries and chemicals. Being non toxic ABS complies with the toxicological requirements of the British Plastics Federation and the British Industrial Biological Research Association (BIBRA) code of practice for food usage. ABS Pipe Systems are very suitable for chilled water applications, due to its low temperature properties. ABS is also suitable for use in compressed airline systems. </p>

PVC-U (Polyvinyl Chloride, Unplasticized)</st>

<p>

PVC-U has excellent chemical resistance across its operating temperature range, with a broad band of operating pressures. Due to its long term strength characteristics, high stiffness and cost effectiveness, PVC-U systems account for a large proportion of plastic piping installations. PVC-U is resistant to most solutions of acids, alkalis, salts and organic compounds miscible with water. It is not resistant to solvents, aromatics and some chlorinated hydrocarbons. PVC-U is not at all suitable for compressed air systems.</p>

PVC-C has excellent chemical resistance across its operating temperature range, with a
broad band of operating pressures. Due to its long-term strength characteristics, high stiffness and cost effectiveness, PVC-C systems are suitable for a wide diversity of plastic piping installations. PVC-C is resistant to many acids, bases, salts, paraffinic hydrocarbons, halogens and alcohols. It is not resistant to solvents, aromatics and some chlorinated hydrocarbons.</p>

When compared to other plastics, PE shows excellent diffusion resistance, and because of this property, polyethylene has been successfully used for the safe conveyance of
gases for many years. Polyethylene has good resistance to acids and caustic substances. Resistant to organic and inorganic solvents at a wide range of temperatures. It is not resistant to strong oxidising acids.</p>

PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride)</st>

<p>

PVDF has excellent chemical resistance which means that it is widely used in the chemical industry as a piping system for aggressive liquids. PVDF is a homopolymer without additives such as stabilisers and processing agents. It also displays excellent flame retardant properties. PVDF is listed with many worldwide agencies as suitable for use with
foodstuffs, dairy products, in semi-conductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing, and for other applications in the food and drug sector. PVDF is resistant to most acids, alkalis, salts, halogens, alcohols and chlorinated hydro-carbons. Strong polarized solvents, such as ketones and esters, can cause the material to swell.</p>

 Pipe support and hanging </st>

<p>

When supporting or hanging plastic pipe systems there are a few factors that have to be considered, so that the correct pipe supports can be selected.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Material and type of plastic pipe system</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Outside diameter of the plastic pipe</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Temperature of fluid or medium</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

These factors are interlinked and only when all have been addressed can the correct type of pipe supports be selected. The above information is also critical for determining the distance between each pipe support, this is referred to in the industry as pipe centers or pipe centres depending on your country of origin.</p>

<sec>
<st>
 Safety Factors </st>

<p>

Each component within a Plastic Pressure Pipe System is given a pressure marking relating to the amount of pressure it can sustain. However, each manufacturer tests the product beyond its individual rating so that a safety factor can be quoted. With all pressurised systems there can be spikes hence the need for safety factors. In general, each manufacturer tests their product to the following safety factors:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Pipes = X 1.5 the product pressure rating</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Pipe fittings = X 3 the product pressure rating</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Valves = X 3 the product pressure rating</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Note: This information is provided for the purpose of explaining why a safety factor exists. Each manufacturer has their own safety factors to which you must refer.</p>
