The <b>probabilistic method</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../113/360113.xml">
nonconstructive</link> method, primarily used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/5170.xml">
combinatorics</link> and pioneered by <link>
Paul Erd&#337;s</link>, for proving the existence of a prescribed kind of mathematical object.
This method has now been applied to other areas of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/18831.xml">
mathematics</link> such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../527/21527.xml">
number theory</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/18422.xml">
linear algebra</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/26478.xml">
real analysis</link>.
It works by showing that if one randomly chooses objects from a specified class, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/22934.xml">
probability</link> that the result is of the prescribed kind is more than zero.  Although the proof uses probability, the final conclusion is determined for <it>certain</it>, without any possible error.<p>

If every object in a collection of objects fails to have a certain property, then the probability that a random object chosen from the collection has that property is zero. Turning this around, if the probability that the random object has the property is greater than zero, then this proves the existence of at least one object in the collection that has the property. It doesn't matter if the probability is vanishingly small; any positive probability will do.</p>
<p>

Similarly, showing that the probability is (strictly) less than 1 can be used to prove the existence of an object that does <it>not</it> satisfy the prescribed properties.</p>
<p>

Another way to use the probabilistic method is by calculating the expected value of some random variable. If it can be shown that the random variable can take on a value less than the expected value, this proves that the random variable can also take on some value greater than the expected value.</p>

Two examples due to Erd&#337;s</st>

<p>

Although others before him proved theorems via the probabilistic method (for example, Szele's 1943 result that there exist <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/1427502.xml">
tournaments</link> containing a large number of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/244437.xml">
Hamiltonian cycle</link>s), many of the most well known proofs using this method are due to Erdős.  One such result is this 1947 proof giving a lower bound on the <statement wordnetid="106722453" confidence="0.8">

<st>
First example</st>
<p>

Suppose we have a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/85816.xml">
complete graph</link> on <it>n</it> vertices.  We wish to show (for small enough values of <it>n</it>) that it is possible to color the edges of the graph in two colors (say red and blue) so that there is no complete subgraph on <it>r</it> vertices which is monochromatic (every edge colored the same color).</p>
<p>

To do so, we color the graph randomly.  Color each edge independently with probability 1/2 of being red and 1/2 of being blue.  We calculate the expected number of monochromatic subgraphs on <it>r</it> vertices as follows:</p>
<p>

For any set <it>S</it> of <it>r</it> vertices from our graph, define the variable <it>X</it>(<it>S</it>) to be 1 if every edge amongst the <it>r</it> vertices is the same color, and 0 otherwise.  Note that the number of monochromatic <it>r</it>-subgraphs is the sum of <it>X</it>(S) over all possible subsets.  For any <it>S</it>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/9653.xml">
expected value</link> of <it>X</it>(<it>S</it>) is simply the probability that all of the <math>{r \choose 2}</math> edges in <it>S</it> are the same color, </p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>2 \cdot 2^{-{r \choose 2}}</math>
</indent>

(the factor of 2 comes because there are two possible colors).  </p>
<p>

This holds true for any of the C(<it>n</it>,<it>r</it>) possible subsets we could have chosen, so we have that the sum of E[''X''(''S'')] over all <it>S</it> is </p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>{n \choose r}2^{1-{r \choose 2}}.</math>
</indent>

The sum of an expectation is the expectation of the sum (<it>regardless</it> of whether the variables are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/27593.xml">
independent</link>), so the expectation of the sum (the expected number of monochromatic <it>r</it>-subgraphs) is </p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>{n \choose r}2^{1-{r \choose 2}}.</math>
</indent>

Consider what happens if this value is less than 1.  The number of monochromatic <it>r</it>-subgraphs in our random coloring will always be an integer, so must for at least one coloring be less than the expected value. But the only integer which satisfies this criterion is 0.  Thus if </p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>C(n,r) &amp;lt; 2^{{r \choose 2} - 1}</math>,
</indent>

some coloring fits our desired criterion, so by definition R(<it>r</it>, <it>r</it>; 2) must be bigger than <it>n</it>.  In particular, R(<it>r</it>, <it>r</it>; 2) must <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/191933.xml">
grow at least exponentially</link> with <it>r</it>.</p>
<p>

A peculiarity of this argument is that it is entirely <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../113/360113.xml">
nonconstructive</link>.  Even though it proves (for example) that almost every coloring of the complete graph on <it>(1.1)r</it> vertices contains no monochromatic <it>r</it>-subgraph, it gives no explicit example of such a coloring.  The problem of finding such a coloring has been open for more than 50 years.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
Second example</st>

<p>

A 1959 paper of Erdős (see reference cited below) addressed the following problem in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/12401.xml">
graph theory</link>:  given positive integers <it>g</it> and <it>k</it>, does there exist a graph <it>G</it> containing no <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/168609.xml">
cycles</link> of length at most <it>g</it>, such that the <link>
chromatic number</link> of <it>G</it> is at least <it>k</it>?</p>
<p>

It can be shown that such a graph exists for any <it>g</it> and <it>k</it>, and the proof is reasonably simple.  Let <it>n</it> be very large and consider a random graph <it>G</it> on <it>n</it> vertices, where every edge in <it>G</it> exists with probability <it>n</it>(1-<it>g</it>)/<it>g</it>.  It can be shown that with positive probability, the following two properties hold:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>G</it> contains no <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/524501.xml">
independent set</link> of size <math>\lceil n/2k \rceil</math></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>G</it> contains at most <it>n</it>/2 cycles of length at most <it>g</it>.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Here comes the trick:  since <it>G</it> has these two properties, we can remove at most <it>n</it>/2 vertices from <it>G</it> to obtain a new graph <it>G'</it> on <it>n'</it> vertices that contains no cycles of length at most <it>g</it>.  We can see that this new graph has no independent set of size <math>\lceil n'/k \rceil</math>, hence <it>G'</it> has chromatic number at least <it>k</it>.</p>
<p>

This result gives a hint as to why the computation of the <condition wordnetid="113920835" confidence="0.8">
<state wordnetid="100024720" confidence="0.8">
<problem wordnetid="114410605" confidence="0.8">
<difficulty wordnetid="114408086" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/426743.xml">
chromatic number</link></difficulty>
</problem>
</state>
</condition>
 of a graph is so difficult: even when there are no local reasons (such as small cycles) for a graph to require many colors the chromatic number can still be arbitrarily large.</p>
