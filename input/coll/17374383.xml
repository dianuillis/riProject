<b>Hojiblanca</b> (literally "white leaf") is a type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
olive</link> used for the production of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>. It represents  16% of the olive production in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../736/2736.xml">
Andalucia</link> and is grown mainly in the provinces of Seville, Cordoba and northern <link>
MÃ¡laga</link>. It is collected late in the season (March-April), which leads to a lower production rate. It is also harder to pick as it rarely falls from the trees on its own.<p>

However the vegetable flavours, smoothness, aftertaste and its lower level of saturated fat make this a much prized variety.</p>
