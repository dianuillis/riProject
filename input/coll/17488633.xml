The <b>Dioxine affair</b> was a political crisis that struck in Belgium during the spring of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/34553.xml">

 Political scandal </st>

<p>

The dioxine affair started with some complaints of chicken-farmers that noticed increased death among 
newborn chickens. Already in January, the relation was laid between abnormal levels of dioxine and the increased mortality.  However, dioxins are mostly metabolized from PCBs, and PCBs are detected much faster and cheaper, so the dioxine crisis developed into a PCB crisis.</p>
<p>

The ministers <link>
Karel Pinxten</link>, of agriculture, and <link>
Marcel Colla</link> of health issues immediately resigned from their offices, and a commission was installed to investigate the probable sources of contamination and the errors that had been made by the government. Later investigations revealed that the source of the contamination came from an oil-and-fat-recycling company 'Verkest' from <municipality wordnetid="108626283" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../059/155059.xml">
Deinze</link></municipality>
.
The fats, that where processed also into animalfeed, contained <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/2159805.xml">
transformer oil</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/1826695.xml">
coolant</link> fluid).</p>
<p>

Public concern about the quality of animal food in general became a hot issue in the media. This forced the commission to ban certain recycling streams (like frying oil) from entering the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../772/145772.xml">
food chain</link>, in order to prevent future contamination. Although later studies proved that there was never a serious danger for human health because the contaminated material was largely diluted during the production of the animalfeed <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>, 7 million chickens and 50.000 pigs where slaughtered and discarded.</p>
<p>

Many farmers where closed down for months, and animal food products where banned from the foodmarket.
During the investigation, questions where raised if the costs for destroying the food and feedstock where not unnecessary, as it seems obvious that the contaminated food had already passed through the foodmarket during the period January-may. To protect the farmers, the Belgian government promissed to compensate the losses.  The crisis also damaged the export of Belgian animal food products. Many Belgians went shopping for meat and diery products in foreign countries. The total costs of the food crisis are estimated at 25 billion franks, or 625 million euro's. </p>

 Health implications </st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/34551.xml">
2001</link> a public report announced that high dioxine levels where detected in blood plasm, compared to other European populations. A direct link to the dioxin crisis seemed obvious. Later comparison with blood-samples that where taken before the crisis disproved this hypotheses. High levels can also be attributed to the dense populations and industry.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
