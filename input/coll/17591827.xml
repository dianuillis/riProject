<b>Scispace.net</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/3201698.xml">
non-commercial</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/72487.xml">
non-profit</link> and free-to-use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> designed specifically for collaborating researchers. In several respects it builds on many of the tools found in standard <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/74677.xml">
elearning</link> sites, such as the use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/32851.xml">
wikis</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/33645.xml">
blogs</link>, comments, tags, comment walls, and profiles. However, unlike many of these sites, privacy and fine-grained access control is of paramount importance. For example, a small group of researchers using these tools to develop a set of ideas that will ultimately lead to a publication or funding proposal need to be certain that their ideas, and the existence of these ideas, will not be seen by others. Until the advent of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> and related <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../022/1555022.xml">
web 2.0</link> technologies, the primary tool for collaborators has been <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">
email</link>, which the owners/authors feel serves this purpose only poorly<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>.</p>
<p>

Scispace.net has been developed by scientists working within an academic environment, but the owners/authors believe that this approach should be able to meet the needs of collaborators working in different disciplines and different environments. In many ways scispace.net is an active experiment in how these tools can be used to support collaborative research, in what is actually a fast-changing environment. </p>

<p>

The owners/authors have a strong interest in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/1001976.xml">
e-science</link> in their professional work, one significant component of which is to support collaboration between researchers. With experience of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> sites such as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../378/7529378.xml">
Facebook</link></company>
 in their personal lives, they were prompted to think about a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> site that could support collaborating researchers during some breakout discussions at a scientific workshop (January 2007)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> when participants kept suggesting that it would be useful to such a tool -- the phrase used was a "<company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/1270655.xml">
MySpace</link></company>
 for scientists". This led to some analysis of what was then available (including network.nature.com) in terms of existing services, and an analysis of the available tools. The conclusion was that the better approach was to create a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> specifically tailored to the needs of collaborating researchers rather than attempt to use an existing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">

 About the owners/authors </st>
<p>

The owners/authors have a strong interest in using modern technologies -- particularly web-based techologies -- to support collaborative research. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/1001976.xml">
e-science</link> slant on this is the use of technologies to support <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/627597.xml">
virtual organization</link>s. The owners/authors original approach involved developing and using shared file-systems for easy exchange of data and information (one example being the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../957/1183957.xml">
storage resource broker</link>)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>, information-centric representations of data and corresponding tools<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>, the development of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/18933632.xml">
metadata</link> services<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>, and the use of communications tools such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/55951.xml">
instant messaging</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../142/767142.xml">
Access Grid</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>. They were also using tools such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/32851.xml">
wikis</link> and blogs extensively, but increasingly felt the need for an integrated collaborative tool that would exploit the advantages of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2041117.xml">
social network service</link> tools.</p>
