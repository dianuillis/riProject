Differences from the food guide pyramid</st>
<p>

In a departure from the food guide pyramid, which was launched in 1992, no foods are pictured on the MyPyramid logo itself. Instead, colored vertical bands represent different food groups. Additionally, the logo emphasizes physical activity by showing a person climbing steps on the side of the pyramid. MyPyramid was intentionally made simpler than the food guide pyramid after several USDA studies indicated that consumers widely misunderstood the original design.  Consumers are asked to visit the  website for personalized nutrition information.</p>
<p>

The food guide pyramid gave recommendations measured in "serving sizes," which some people found confusing. MyPyramid  gives its recommendations in common household measures, such as cups, ounces, and other measures that may be easier to understand.</p>
<p>

The food guide pyramid gave a single set of specific recommendations for all people. In contrast, MyPyramid has 12 sets of possible recommendations, with the appropriate guide for an individual selected based on sex, age group, and activity level.  MyPyramid does provide sample recommendations on their miniposter, shown here.  <image width="600px" src="Miniposter-1.png">

According to its website, MyPyramid and its associated guidelines were designed for all Americans over 2 years old. A working title of <it>food guidance system</it> was used before the MyPyramid name was chosen.&#91;&#93;</p>
<p>

The MyPyramid update was long-awaited by several lobbying, consumer-advocacy, and professional groups, including the <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">
<society wordnetid="107966140" confidence="0.8">

</society>
</social_group>
, which played a role in recommending the update.</p>
<p>

In September 2005, a "child-friendly version" of the food pyramid graphic and food guidance system launched.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
