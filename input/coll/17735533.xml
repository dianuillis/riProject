<b>Pandora Villenueva:</b> Pandora Villenueva is a intelligent, but mentally traumatized young woman. She is hostile, bitter and rebellious. She has been in and out of psychiatrist offices all her life since she at the age of six found her uncle dead and bloodied from the yard of her home. She is sharp, privileged and often out-wits her doctors. Regardless of her occasional mental problems, she is still the one who sees things most clearly in her family. Sadly tough no one tends to believe her when she tries to warn them of her mothers, Olimpia's, evil schemes and manipulations.</entry>

. The two of them have co-stared in three telenovelas: <it>La Niña de mis Ojos</it>, <it>Mi Gorda Bella</it> and <it>Por todo lo Alto</it>.</p>
<p>

Marianela's favorite color is red and her favorite book is "A orillas del río Piedra me senté y lloré" by Paolo Coelho. Her favorite actors are Robert De Niro and Julia Roberts. Her favorite song is Ronan Keatings "When you say nothing at all" from the movie Notting Hill. She has a dog named Take. Her favorite food is sushi.</p>
<p>

When asked to describe herself in three words she said she was bad-mannered, positive and generous. She also said that he best quality is being a really good friend. The worst defect she considered to have was that she always relied on reason and wanted to have the last word on everything. She said that she is most happiest when she is in the company of her friends and loved ones. And most sad when she is alone. Unlike her character, Pandora Villenueva in Mi Gorda Bella, she is not hot-tempered, but she can be jealous.</p>
<p>

Marianela's ideal man would be sincere, diligent, intelligent, understanding and someone who would appreciate her as she is. She believes in marriage, but not in love at first sight.</p>
