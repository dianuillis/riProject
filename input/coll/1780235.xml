Original Soviet crystal coffin</st>
<p>

The first attempted solution for the display of Mao's body was to use the crystal coffin the USSR had provided for <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</person>
</president>
, who died in 1925.  This proved unfeasible, however, because the length of the coffin (1.75 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../947/18947.xml">
metre</link>s) was not sufficient for Mao's 1.8 metre height.  Furthermore, as the Soviets had only made the cover out of crystal, with the sides and the bottom made of steel with nickel plating, visitors would have been forced to look down at Mao's body in a way that was deemed unacceptable by the authorities.</p>

</ss1>

<p>

Projects to develop an indigenous crystal coffin were distributed to enterprises all over China in code names, and the one named "Task # 1" was assigned to the 608th Factory.  The 608th factory was originally the 2nd Spectacles Factory, and was famed for its good quality products.  For example, in 1963, merchants in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../404/13404.xml">
Hong Kong</link></country>
 placed an order of 6,000 pairs of lenses, the largest single foreign order China received at the time, and later, the camera lenses it produced were exported to East German <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../792/18369792.xml">
Zeiss</link> firm.  Once its products were used for military applications, the name of the factory was changed to 608th Factory for security reasons.  In 1976, the factory was one of the few in China equipped with advanced imported equipment and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/20266.xml">
mainframe computer</link>.  Mao's spectacles and magnifying glasses were made in this factory, under the plant manager, Mr. Cai Dengyuan (蔡登元), who was a famous optometrist/optician before becoming the plant manager.  The communist party secretary of the plant was Mr. Wang Zhuqian (王著谦).
The design was a political task, and started immediately after the order was received, even before the design team had an opportunity to inspect the Soviet crystal coffin delivered to China in 1925 for Dr. <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. Just two days after receiving the fax, the design was completed, and a 1:4 scaled mock-up made of plastic was built soon after.</p>

Material and technical challenges</st>
<p>

Quartz glass is a vital material for the production of crystal coffins, but the raw material - quartz crystals - were rare in China. Furthermore, less than 10% of the total available quartz met the requirements to manufacture quartz glass.  The largest piece found in China was no larger than 40 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../669/7669.xml">
cm</link>, and there was no good grade crystal in the world of the required size: 2 metres.</p>
<p>

Compounding the material shortage, there was no equipment in China large enough to handle the size of the required material. In fact, there was (and at present still is) no such equipment of this kind in the world, and the largest piece China was equipped to handle was only 0.5 metres or less.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Overcoming the difficulties</st>
<p>

The subcontractors to produce the quartz powder for the quartz glass surfaces of the crystal coffin were numerous, including the 603rd factory, the 605th factory, and the <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/18603746.xml">
Beijing</link></village>
 General Glass Factory.  The crystal used was from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../381/181381.xml">
East China Sea</link>, solving the raw material shortage problem, but there was a new problem:  after the annealing, it would take three years for the internal stress of the large piece of quartz glass to disappear. Xu Zhaocai (徐兆采), a senior technician of the 605th Factory, developed a new technique of processing that solved this problem by welding 20 square centimeter pieces into the larger 2 square meters plate.  The melting point was over 2000 degrees Celsius, and a senior technician, Shi Weicheng (石维成) was assigned the task of welding with a hydrogen-oxygen flame gun.  During the welding process, the metallic protective gear worn by Shi Weicheng (石维成) began to smoke due to the high temperature, and he had to stand in a specially designed pool while other workers poured water on him to cool him down; when he was finished, the water level reached his ankles.  The resulting purity reached 99.9999%, a world record that has not yet been broken since.</p>

Processing the crystal plate</st>
<p>

The 100 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../949/72949.xml">
mm</link> crystal plates needed to be ground down to 45 mm in order to be built into the crystal coffin, and China had no technology to do so.  The 608th factory staff finally found equipment large enough for the task in the <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/18603746.xml">
Beijing</link></village>
 First Machine Tool Factory: a single West German 2 metre precision grinding machine and eight planer-type milling machines.  The equipment did not exactly meet the requirements, so the teams of both factories sacrificed other production to join forces and modify the equipment to fit the exact need of the political task. At this time, Beijing was frequently struck by the aftershocks of the <process wordnetid="100029677" confidence="0.8">

; during these aftershocks, workers would reportedly stop the machine and throw themselves on top of the plates, using their own bodies to shield the plates from falling debris.</p>

Illumination</st>
<p>

While overcoming the problems of processing the crystal into the quartz plates, the issue of appropriate illumination was being worked on simultaneously, lead by project manager Ren Fuguang (任夫广), the head of the optical research and design department, with the optical engineer Li Jiaying (李家英) as the chief designer.</p>
<p>

<village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/18603746.xml">
Beijing</link></village>
 Medical University (now merged into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../296/72296.xml">
Beijing University</link>) provided a ten-year old specimen head for the project, and after harmonizing colors by varying the colors, angles, and intensity of the illumination, the skin color appeared to be closer to that of a living person instead of the original gray, and the appearance of wrinkles was significantly reduced. After evaluating numerous designs, it was decided to adopt illumination via xenon lamps installed inside the coffin. The xenon lamps inside the coffin were from a brand new design that adopted fiber-optic technology, could not be seen by visitors when viewing Mao's body, and would still provide the correct illumination if one of the lamps was out. The xenon illumination system inside the crystal coffin was designed by Cai Zuquan (蔡祖泉).</p>

Shape of the coffin</st>
<p>

In order to eliminate reflections, as well as obtaining the strongest strength, the crystal plates had to be connected at precise angles. Optical engineer Wang Daheng(王大珩) was enlisted to help and after numerous calculations the best angles were obtained.  It was discovered that the selection of the angles was so precise that even without the adhesives and other methods of connection, the plates would not collapse.  The dimensional tolerance was up to 10 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/20627.xml">
micrometre</link>s.</p>

Nearly two dozen crystal coffins from all over China were also there for the competition, and <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, which was in a circular shape with red carpet inside, symbolizing the red sun, the symbol of Mao during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/45311.xml">
Cultural Revolution</link>.  However, the crystal coffin built by the 608th factory defeated its competitors and was selected on the spot.</p>
<p>

The building of the crystal coffin for Mao was a closely guarded secret until recently, and Dr. Xu Jing (徐静), who participated in the design and later headed the managerial bureau of Mao Zedong's Mausoleum before his retirement, wrote a book titled <it>The Place where a Great Man Rests</it> after the declassification to finally reveal the previously unknown process to the public.</p>

Visiting</st>
<p>

Mao Zedong's surviving family members (with exception of his jailed widow) always visit the mausoleum annually on Mao's birthday and the day passed.  However, according to the publications of Mao's great granddaughter Kong Dongmei (孔东梅, the granddaughter of Mao's daughter Li Min 李敏), Mao's ex-wife He Zizhen (贺子珍) was initially banned from visiting the mausoleum.  The reason was never given by the Chinese government.  After more than a year of repeated appealing and nearly two million people had already visited the mausoleum, He Zizhen was finally allowed for a single visit, with heavy restrictions: the visit must be secret and He Zizhen must not cry, not making any noise and must not talk to press to talk about the visit. He Zizhen was allowed to be photographed with her ex-husband's statue in the mausoleum by Lu Xiangyou (吕相友), Mao's personal photographer since the late 1950's.  Dr. Xu Jing (徐静), the author of the book titled <it>The Place where a Great Man Rests</it> documented the visit by important people to the mausoleum, but He Zizhen's visit on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/28488.xml">
September 8</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/34754.xml">
1979</link> was not allowed by the Chinese government to be included in the book, and the reason is never given by the Chinese government, just like that of the restriction on Mao's ex-wife visiting.</p>

Controversy</st>
<p>

After the reform started in 1979 in China, however, it was revealed that the symbolic voluntary labor was, allegedly, a complete waste of time and other resources, because the significant majority of the voluntary work performed was nothing other than a political propaganda showpiece: the 'volunteers' would come to the construction site to form a human chain and pass the bricks from one end to the other, and the next day, a different group of the 'volunteers' would repeat the task, except the bricks were passed back to the original spot. Actual work that would really help the construction was never done.  As a result, the construction of the mausoleum of Mao cost (measured in 1977 prices) ten times more than that of the <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

 (measured in 1959 prices).  This waste of resources was used by the reformers within the communist party to criticize <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../434/100434.xml">

 and his followers, but once the reformers had consolidated their power after Hua Guofeng was removed, further discussion on this sensitive topic was banned.</p>

Vandalism attempts</st>
<p>

Security of the mausoleum has increased steadily since its completion due to sporadic vandalism attempts. The Chinese government admits that the guards have successfully thwarted two vandalism attempts by subduing the culprits while they were still waiting in line outside: both were carried out by a man acting alone, and both involved attempts to use explosives. In one case, the guards discovered the wooden handles of hand grenades protruding outside the culprit's pockets, while in the other, the guards discovered the unusually bulging pockets of the culprit contained dynamite.</p>
<p>

According to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../849/45849.xml">
Chinese democracy movement</link>, there was at least one attempt which successfully reached inside the mausoleum: in the 1990s, an unemployed female textile worker from <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 managed to slip inside and attempted to use a metal weight to crack the crystal casket of Mao, but she was quickly apprehended.</p>
