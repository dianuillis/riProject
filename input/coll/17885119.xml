. One year later in 1941, Bush was appointed to Director of the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../844/1633844.xml">
Office of Scientific Research and Development</link>." This was created in order to coordinate weapons development research. By the end of the war, more than 6,000 scientists were employed to the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which also supervised the development of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/21785.xml">

" in 1948. Before Shannon, people believed that the only way of achieving arbitrarily small probability of error in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/156700.xml">
communication channel</link> was to reduce the transmission rate to zero. This changed in 1948 with the publication of "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," where Shannon showed that with a single parameter channel, it was possible to transmit information at any rate below capacity with small <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/22934.xml">
probability</link> of error. His paper established fundamental limits on the efficiency of communication over <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/3474289.xml">
noisy channel</link>s, and presented the challenge of finding families of codes to achieve capacity. This method of random coding does not produce an explicit example of a good code, and it has taken fifty years for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/321869.xml">
coding theorists</link> to discover codes that come close to these fundamental limits on telephone channels. He created the idea that all information could be represented using ones and zeros, later calling these "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/3364.xml">
bit</link>s". In 1936, Shannon won a <award wordnetid="106696483" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<b>Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider</b> developed the idea of a universal network, spreading his vision throughout the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../887/230887.xml">
IPTO</link>, and inspiring his successors to realize his dreams by the creation of the ARPANET. He realized that interactive computers could provide more than a library function and could provide great value as automated assistants. In 1960, he captured his ideas in a paper called "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../917/3948917.xml">
Man-Computer Symbiosis</link>", in which he described a computer assistant that could answer questions, perform simulation <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../416/375416.xml">

. Baran began investigating the development of survivable communication networks, the results being presented to the Air Force in 1961 as briefing B-265, then as paper P-2626, then as a series of papers titled "On Distributed communications"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> in 1964. His study describes a detailed architecture for a distributed survivable packet switched communications network. The network is designed to withstand almost any degree of damage, and since each computer could be connected to one or more other computers, it was assumed that any link of the network could fail at any time. Baran's design was created to withstand a nuclear conflict and helped convince the US military that wide area digital computer networks were a promising technology. He has received several awards including the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../288/12953288.xml">

Nelson has continued to expound his ideas, but he did not possess the technical knowledge to tell others how his ideas could be implemented. Still, he persisted and in 1964, he named his system Xanadu, where with the help of computer hacks, has continued to develop. Xandu has never been totally completed and is far from being implemented. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

<b>Leonard Kleinrock</b> is one of the pioneers of digital network communications and helped to build the early ARPANET. He published his first paper on digital network communications, "Information Flow in Large Communication Nets", in 1961. After completing his thesis in 1962, he moved to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../765/37765.xml">
UCLA</link> and later established the NMC, led by himself and consisting of a group of graduate students working in the area of digital networks. In 1966, Roberts joined the IPTO with a mandate to help the ARPANET. In 1969, a team at NMC connected one of their <link>
SDS Sigma 7</link> computers to an Interface Message Processor, thereby becoming the first node on ARPANET and the first ever computer on the Internet. As the ARPANET continued to grow, NMC stressed the system to work out the detailed design and performance issues involved with the world's first packet switched network. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
