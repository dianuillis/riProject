A <b>lubricant</b> (sometimes referred to as a "Lube") is a substance (often a liquid) introduced between two moving surfaces to reduce the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/11062.xml">
friction</link> between them, improving <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../344/268344.xml">
efficiency</link> and reducing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/366023.xml">
wear</link>. It is used the the engine of the car to help reduce friction. =]They also have the function of dissolving foreign particles. Petroleum-based lubricants like <name wordnetid="106333653" confidence="0.8">

 tend to dissolve petroleum products such as rubber and plastic, while water-based lubricants will dissolve polar chemicals. The lubricant must be replaced when it has dissolved to saturation, because the inability to dissolve additional debris allows abrasive particles to scrape against or become lodged in the working surfaces. Lubricants which dissolve working surfaces (such as Vaseline with rubber) defeat their purpose by corroding the smooth surfaces by their own dissolving power, thus compromising structural integrity, surface smoothness, and system-wide contamination.</p>
<p>

One of the single largest applications for lubricants, in the form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/216189.xml">
motor oil</link>, is to protect the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../796/14796.xml">
internal combustion engine</link>s in motor vehicles and powered equipment.</p>
<p>

Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil (most often <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link> fractions, called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/212419.xml">

corrosion</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/66313.xml">
oxidation</link>, aging or contamination, etc.  </p>
<p>

Lubricants such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/2819592.xml">
2-cycle oil</link> are also added to some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/10973.xml">
fuel</link>s. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../127/27127.xml">
Sulfur</link> impurities in fuels also provide some lubrication properties, which has to be taken in account when switching to a low-sulfur <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/81761.xml">
diesel</link>; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/188551.xml">
biodiesel</link> is a popular diesel fuel additive providing additional lubricity.</p>
<p>

Non-liquid lubricants include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/2439173.xml">
grease</link>,  powders (dry <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/12366.xml">

Molybdenum disulfide</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/5081146.xml">
tungsten disulfide</link>, etc.), teflon tape used in plumbing, air cushion and others.   <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/14949005.xml">
Dry lubricant</link>s such as graphite, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide also offer lubrication at temperatures (up to 350 Â°C) higher than liquid and oil-based lubricants are able to operate.   Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/6717193.xml">
compacted oxide glaze layer</link>s formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature. </p>
<p>

Another approach to reducing friction and wear is to use bearings such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/198101.xml">
ball bearing</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../542/627542.xml">
roller bearing</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/708581.xml">
air bearing</link>s, which in turn require internal lubrication themselves, or to use sound, in the case of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../486/2411486.xml">
acoustic lubrication</link>. </p>
<p>

In addition to automotive and industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes, including as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/574981.xml">
personal lubricant</link>, bio-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../957/18957.xml">

<ss1>
<st>
Keep moving parts apart</st>
<p>

Lubricants are typically used to separate moving parts in a system. This has the benefit of reducing friction and surface fatigue together with reduced heat generation, operating noise and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this by several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e. a thin layer of lubricant separates the moving parts. This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication. In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant. This is termed elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Reduce friction</st>

<p>

Typically the lubricant-to-surface <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/11062.xml">
friction</link> is much less than surface-to-surface friction in a system without any lubrication. Thus use of a lubricant reduces the overall system friction. Reduced friction has the benefit of reducing heat generation and reduced formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency. Lubricants may contain additives known as friction modifiers that chemically bind to metal surfaces to reduce surface friction even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant present for hydrodynamic lubrication, e.g. protecting the valve train in a car engine at startup.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Transfer heat</st>

<p>

Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants are much more effective on account of their high specific <link>
heat capacity</link>. Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used to warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/30886.xml">
turbocharger</link> is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short i.e. high flow rate. If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways, reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure typically with seized <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

Non-flowing lubricants such as greases &amp; pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Carry away contaminants and debris</st>

<p>

Lubricant circulation systems have the benefit of carrying away internally generated debris and external contaminants that get introduced into the system to a filter where they can be removed. Lubricants for machines that regularly generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically contain detergent and dispersant additives to assist in debris and contaminant transport to the filter and removal. Over time the filter will get clogged and require cleaning or replacement, hence the recommendation to change a car's oil filter at the same time as changing the oil. In closed systems such as gear boxes the filter may be supplemented by a magnet to attract any iron fines that get created.</p>
<p>

It is apparent that in a circulatory system the oil will only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that there are no industry standards by which consumers can readily assess the filtering ability of various automotive filters. Poor filtration significantly reduces the life of the machine (engine) as well as making the system inefficient.</p>

Transmit power</st>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/884441.xml">

Protect against wear</st>

<p>

Lubricants prevent wear by keeping the moving parts apart. Lubricants may also contain anti-wear or extreme pressure additives to boost their performance against wear and fatigue.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Prevent corrosion</st>

<p>

Good quality lubricants are typically formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces to prevent corrosion and rust.</p>

 'Glaze' formation (high temperature wear) </st>

<p>

A further phenomenon that has undergone investigation in relation to high temperature wear prevention and lubrication, is that of '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/6717193.xml">
glaze</link>' formation (<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/high_temp_wear/mythesis.html">
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/high_temp_wear/mythesis.html</weblink>).   This is the generation of a compacted oxide layer which sinters together to form a crystalline 'glaze' (not the amorphous layer seen in pottery) generally at high temperatures, from metallic surfaces sliding against each other (or a metallic surface against a ceramic surface).   Due to the elimination of metallic contact and adhesion by the generation of oxide, friction and wear is reduced.   Effectively, such a surface is self-lubricating.</p>
<p>

As the 'glaze' is already an oxide, it can survive to very high temperatures in air or oxidising environments.   However, it is disadvantaged by it being necessary for the base metal (or ceramic) having to undergo some wear first to generate sufficient oxide debris.</p>

 Marketing </st>

<p>

The global lubricant market is generally competitive with numerous manufacturers and marketers. Overall the western market may be considered mature with a flat to declining overall volumes while there is strong growth in the emerging economies. The lubricant marketers generally--- pursue one or more of the following strategies when pursuing business.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Specification:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The lubricant is said to meet a certain specification. In the consumer market, this is often supported by a logo, symbol or words that inform the consumer that the lubricant marketer has obtained independent verification of conformance to the specification.  Examples of these include the APIâs donut logo or the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/345898.xml">
NSF</link> tick mark. The most widely perceived is SAE viscosity specification, like <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

 10W-40. Lubricity specifications are institute and manufacturer based. In the U.S. institute: API S for petrol engines, API C for diesel engines. For 2007 the current specs are API SM and API CJ. Higher second letter marks better oil properties, like lower engine wear supported by tests. In EU the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/309921.xml">
ACEA</link> specifications are used. There are classes A,B,C,E with number following the letter. Japan introduced the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../292/4359292.xml">
JASO</link> specification for motorbike engines.
In the industrial market place the specification may take the form of a legal contract to supply a conforming fluid or purchasers may choose to buy on the basis of a manufacturers own published specification.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) approval:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Specifications often denote a minimum acceptable performance levels. Thus many equipment manufacturers add on their own particular requirements or tighten the tolerance on a general specification to meet their particular needs (or doing a different set of tests or using different/own testbed engine). This gives the lubricant marketer an avenue to differentiate their product by designing it to meet an OEM specification. Often, the OEM carries out extensive testing and maintains an active list of approved products. This is a powerful marketing tool in the lubricant marketplace. Text on the back of the motor oil label usually has a list of conformity to some OEM specifications, such as MB, MAN, Volvo, Cummins, VW, BMW or others. Manufactures may have vastly different specifications for the range of engines they make; one may not be completely suitable for some other.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Performance:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The lubricant marketer claims benefits for the customer based on the superior performance of the lubricant. Such marketing is supported by glamorous advertising, sponsorships of typically sporting events and endorsements. Unfortunately broad performance claims are common in the consumer marketplace, which are difficult or impossible for a typical consumer to verify. In the B2B market place the marketer is normally expected to show data that supports the claims, hence reducing the use of broad claims. Increasing performance, reducing wear and fuel consumption is also aim of the later API, ACEA and car manufacturer oil specifications, so lubricant marketers can back their claims by doing extensive (and expensive) testing.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Longevity:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The marketer claims that their lubricant maintains its performance over a longer period of time. For example in the consumer market, a typical motor oil change interval is around the 3000-6000 miles (7500-15000 km). The lubricant marketer may offer a lubricant that lasts for 12000 (30000km) miles or more to convince a user to pay a premium. Typically, the consumer would need to check or balance the longer life and any warranties offered by the lubricant manufacturer with the possible loss of equipment manufacturer warranties by not following its schedule. Many car and engine manufacturers support extended drain intervals, but request extended drain interval certified oil used in that case; and sometimes a special oil filter. Example: In older Mercedes-Benz engines and in truck engines one can use engine oil MB 228.1 for basic drain interval. Engine oils conforming with higher specification MB 228.3 may be used twice as long, oil of MB 228.5 specification 3x longer. Note that the oil drain interval is valid for new engine with fuel conforming car manufacturer specification. When using lower grade fuel, or worn engine the oil change interval has to shorten accordingly. In general oils <b>approved</b> for extended use are of higher specification and reduce wear.
In the industrial market place the longevity is generally measured in time units and the lubricant marketer can suffer large financial penalties if their claims are not substantiated.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Efficiency:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The lubricant marketer claims improved equipment efficiency when compared to rival products or technologies, the claim is usually valid when comparing lubricant of higher specification with previous grade. Typically the efficiency is proved by showing a reduction in energy costs to operate the system. Guaranteeing improved efficiency is the goal of some oil test specifications such as <link>
API CI-4</link> <b>Plus</b> for diesel engines. Some car/engine manufacturers also specifically request certain higher efficiency level for lubricants for extended drain intervals.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Operational tolerance:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The lubricant is claimed to cope with specific operational environment needs. Some common environments include dry, wet, cold, hot, fire risk, high load, high or low speed, chemical compatibility, atmospheric compatibility, pressure or vacuum and various combinations. The usual thermal characteristics is outlined with SAE viscosity given for 100Â°C, like SAE 30, SAE 40. For low temperature viscosity the SAE xxW mark is used. Both markings can be combined together to form a SAE 0W-60 for example. <component wordnetid="103081021" confidence="0.8">

<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Economy:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The marketer offers a lubricant at a lower cost than rivals either in the same grade or a similar one that will fill the purpose for lesser price. (Stationary installations with short drain intervals.) Alternative may be offering a more expensive lubricant and promise return in lower wear, specific fuel consumption or longer drain intervals. (Expensive machinery, un-affordable downtimes.)</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Environment friendly:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The lubricant is said to be environmentally friendly. Typically this is supported by qualifying statements or conformance to generally accepted approvals. Several organizations, typically government sponsored, exist globally to qualify and approve such lubricants by evaluating their potential for environmental harm. Typically, the lubricant manufacturer is allowed to indicate such approval by showing some special mark. Examples include the German â<process wordnetid="105701363" confidence="0.8">

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Composition:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The marketer claims novel composition of the lubricant which improves some tangible performance over its rivals. Typically the technology is protected via formal patents or other intellectual property protection mechanism to prevent rivals from copying. Lot of claims in this area are simple marketing buzzwords, since most of them are related to a manufacturer specific process naming (which achieves similar results than other ones) but the competition is prohibited from using a trademark.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Quality:</b></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The marketer claims broad superior quality of its lubricant with no factual evidence. The quality is âprovenâ by references to famous brand, sporting figure, racing team, some professional endorsement or some similar <b>subjective</b> claim. All motor oil labels wear mark similar to "of outstanding quality" or "quality additives", the actual comparative evidence is always lacking.</p>

 Disposal and environmental issues </st>
<p>

It is estimated that 40% of all lubricants are released into the environment. 
<it>Disposal:</it>
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../157/70157.xml">
Recycling</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/5638.xml">
burning</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/211285.xml">
landfill</link> and discharge into water may achieve disposal of used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/18069.xml">
lubricant</link>.
There are typically strict regulations in most countries regarding disposal in landfill and discharge into water as even small amount of lubricant can contaminate a large amount of water. Most regulations permit a threshold level of lubricant that may be present in waste streams and companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually in treating their waste waters to get to acceptable levels.
Burning the lubricant as fuel, typically to generate electricity, is also governed by regulations mainly on account of the relatively high level of additives present. Burning generates both airborne pollutants and ash rich in toxic materials, mainly heavy metal compounds. Thus lubricant burning takes place in specialized facilities that have incorporated special scrubbers to remove airborne pollutants and have access to landfill sites with permits to handle the toxic ash.
Unfortunately, most lubricant that ends up directly in the environment is due to general public discharging it onto the ground, into drains and directly into landfills as trash. Other direct contamination sources include runoff from roadways, accidental spillages, natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages.
Improvement in filtration technologies and processes has now made recycling a viable option (with rising price of base stock and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
crude oil</link>). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated much the same as virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/8301.xml">
distilling</link>, isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.
Occasionally, unused lubricant requires disposal. The best course of action in such situations is to return it to the manufacturer where it can be processed as a part of fresh batches.
<it>Environment:</it>
Lubricants both fresh and used can cause considerable damage to the environment mainly due to their high potential of serious water pollution. Further the additives typically contained in lubricant can be toxic to flora and fauna. In used fluids the oxidation products can be toxic as well. Lubricant persistence in the environment largely depends upon the base fluid, however if very toxic additives are used they may negatively affect the persistence. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../216/171216.xml">
Lanolin</link> lubricants are non-toxic making them the environmental alternative which is safe for both users and the environment.</p>
