 About Imagini</st>

<p>

<b>Imagini</b> is a London-based technology company that has developed patent-pending technology to capture <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../029/18130029.xml">
Visual DNA</link>, a means of understanding emotions through images.  There are currently three patents pending for the underlying IP.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

BBC has nominated Youniverse, Imagini's visual communication platform, one of the best sites on the web.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. Other media such as the The Wall Street Journal <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>,  PC World <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>,  The Guardian <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> or bloggers <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>have positively reviewed Imagini. </p>
<p>

The Imagini technology builds <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../029/18130029.xml">
Visual DNA</link> by collecting the feelings and motivations of consumers using image-based quizzes that identify and map visual preferences across a series of behavioural axes.  The technology can be used to capture emotional responses to a wide variety of pictorial stimuli from aesthetic elements such as style and form, through to more abstract concepts such as freedom, happiness, fulfilment and love.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

This visual approach differs from traditional text-based research tools since it taps into the strongest source of emotional reflex.  Imagini  proposes that feelings are the purest form of communication and emotional responses precede rational thought. Questions answered with words need thought and thoughts modify feelings.  Images access feelings without the need for higher thought.  With Imagini image-based quizzes, users express their emotions in just one click.</p>

The Imagini tool and the term <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../029/18130029.xml">
Visual DNA</link> were invented by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/18130482.xml">
Alex Willcock</link> in 2005.  The first web-based application of the tool and Visual DNA were launched on Imagini.net in 2005.  Imagini.net saw extremely rapid viral growth, with over 5 million people discovering their Visual DNA on the site within the first 6 months. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

Imagini’s technology has been used in collaboration with a number of commercial partners including MSN<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>,  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>, the Art Institute of America, The British Army, Nectar, MyDeco.com and PepsiCo.  </p>

Pepsi International is currently using Imagini’s Youniverse as a new visual communication platform to connect people globally through their love of football, music and more (160 countries, 8 languages).  See <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.pepsiyouniverse.com">

Visual DNA</st>

<p>

VisualDNA is a term for the information captured by London-based company <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../029/18130029.xml">
Imagini</link>’s patent-pending technology for understanding emotions through images. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>  The term, and surrounding methodology, was invented by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/18130482.xml">
Alex Willcock</link> in 2005.</p>
<p>

VisualDNA is universal and unique.  Each person has their own VisualDNA.  Similarly, Imagini claims that every image, every product, every item of web content can have its own VisualDNA code. This code can then be used to match people to people and people to content that they are likely to find relevant.</p>
<p>

BBC has nominated <link>
Youniverse</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../029/18130029.xml">
Imagini</link>'s social network and home of <link>
VisualDNA</link>, one of the best sites on the web.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>

<st>
Methodology and Technology</st>

<p>

Imagini builds VisualDNA by collecting the feelings and motivations of consumers.  The unique methodology and technology is structured around image-based quizzes formulated to capture the visual preferences of a user. The technology can be used to capture emotional responses to a wide variety of pictorial stimuli from aesthetic elements such as style and form, through to more abstract concepts such as freedom, happiness, fulfilment and love.  </p>
<p>

In each quiz, users respond to a series of carefully selected open statements designed to trigger specific emotional responses.   Each statement has a choice of 15 images in a five by three image ‘grid’, usually including one grey ‘none of the above’ box.  The methodology for selecting the images, the metadata stored behind each one, the behavioural criteria and the method of scoring are all inherent to Imagini’s IP and, as such, carefully protected. There are three patents pending for the underlying IP.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
<p>

It is the pattern of images chosen by each user that Imagini describes as their VisualDNA.  In a quiz of ten questions with fifteen options, there are 10 to the power of 15 potential combinations of choice.</p>
<p>

VisualDNA is dynamic.  An individual’s VisualDNA is constantly growing, as is the global database of VDNA.</p>

Consumer Proposition</st>

<p>

VisualDNA is the key to a more personalised internet for consumers.  It delivers a more fun and efficient online experience by filtering content according to the individual user’s tastes and needs. </p>
<p>

A key feature of the Imagini tool is the ability to identify powerful trends and clusters within the VisualDNA database.  It is partly these patterns of commonality of choice that enable highly relevant matches between users and to products and content that they might like. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Commercial Applications</st>

<p>

There are extensive commercial applications for the VisualDNA technology, with the potential to increase reach, lead generation and customer retention.  These include community building, product recommendation, viral marketing and customer insight research.</p>

<p>

Imagini’s methodology and technology is structured around image-based quizzes formulated to capture the visual preferences of a user.  In each quiz, users respond to a series of carefully selected open statements designed to trigger specific emotional responses.   Each statement has a choice of 15 images in a five by three image ‘grid’, usually including one grey ‘none of the above’ box.  The methodology for selecting the images, the metadata stored behind each one, the behavioural criteria and the method of scoring are all inherent to Imagini’s IP and, as such, carefully protected. </p>
<p>

The amount of questions in each quiz varies, as does the subject matter or theme. The scale and diversity of Imagini’s database has enabled it to learn how to adjust the tempo of its quizzes to ensure the best combination of user interest and data management.</p>
<p>

It is the pattern of images chosen by each user that Imagini describes as their Visual DNA.  In a quiz of ten questions with fifteen options, there are 10 to the power of 15 potential combinations of choice.</p>
<p>

At the end of each "quiz", demographic data can also be captured including age, gender, marital status, location and sometimes other details such as income. </p>
<p>

This methodology allows Imagini to identify powerful trends and clusters.  It is partly these patterns of commonality of choice that enable highly relevant matches between users and to products and content that they might like.</p>
<p>

Having completed a quiz, the user receives feedback based on their image selection and their unique Visual DNA, as well as highly tailored recommendations.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>
