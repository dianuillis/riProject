<b>Anson Vasco Call II</b> played a major role in founding <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/140128.xml">

. He was one of six honored July 5, 2008 at the dedication of Afton's new Civic Center.
----<p>

Anson Vasco Call II was born in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/136932.xml">

. During his early boyhood he worked in the fields gleaning wheat. In 1864 his father <link>
Anson Vasco Call</link> was called to serve a mission in England by <denomination wordnetid="108146782" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../935/5935.xml">

, and while returning home in 1867 he died at <river wordnetid="109411430" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../529/15709529.xml">
Rock Creek, Wyoming</link></river>
.</p>
<p>

Anson's Mother was an efficient and hard worker, and provided for her family while the father was on his mission. Once a relative offered her $5.00 for a pair of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../120/172120.xml">
mittens</link> that he needed the next morning. She double knitted the large fancy mittens with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/51971.xml">
yarn</link> she had spun and Anson delivered them before daylight, bringing back the much needed money. This kind of effort on a continual basis resulted in weak health and she contracted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/31596.xml">
typhoid fever</link>, and died in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../667/34667.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22July_-_December%22])">
July 1866</link>. The orphaned children were split up, and Anson went to live with his grandmother, <link>
Mary Flint Call</link>.</p>
<p>

Grandmother was well-educated, and pushed along her very adept student. By the age of seventeen he was enrolled in the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../097/32097.xml">
University of Utah</link></university>
, graduating with the first class in 1875. Also attending was <link>
Alice Jeanette Farnham</link> One afternoon Anson summoned sufficient courage to go to her home and asked her for a date. She replied, "Ask Mother." About four years later they were married in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../837/53837.xml">
Salt Lake City, Utah</link></village>
 on May 17, 1876.</p>
<p>

Anson was a fine carpenter, and he built a new home for his bride. He started work on it at 3:30 A.M., and then walked three miles to Centerville to teach school. He was also serving as the superintendent of schools and stake president of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../858/10845858.xml">
Mutual Improvement Association</link>. When Anson considered taking a second wife, he chose Emily Stayner, Alice's cousin who had grown up in the same home with Alice. However, out of consideration for Alice, she refused him, saying she would as soon be tenth as second. Emily finally became his third wife. Anson had married Lucy King in 1882.</p>
<p>

Severe persecution for practicing plural marriage now made it necessary for him to leave Utah; so he served a mission in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/9316.xml">

Anson arrived back in Utah in 1886 and found his family in good health but arresting of polygamy|polygamists was still very common. Because of this he has to escape to <link>
Chesterfield, Idaho</link> where he lived with his uncle Chester in hiding. Many of his relatives lived in and around Chesterfield, and Emily came to teach music to them. It was there that Anson heard about <natural_elevation wordnetid="109366317" confidence="0.8">
<mountain wordnetid="109359803" confidence="0.8">

, Wyoming and its seclusion and the friendly attitude the Governor had towards polygamists. Alice and Anson and their children set out with Chester's brother, Bowen, to try <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../174/14283174.xml">
pioneer</link>ing in Star Valley. They hauled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/68110.xml">
logs</link> and built two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/639823.xml">
cabins</link>; a one-room cabin for Anson and a two-room cabin for Bowen. There were at that time about ten families living in similar cabins in the Afton town site. On November 16, 1887, Uncle Chester Call arrived with Bowen's wife, Theresa, and daughter, Theresa's mother Pamela Thompson, and Anson's wife Alice with her daughters Maud and Ella. They came in one light <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/403005.xml">
wagon</link> with few supplies. As Uncle Chester drove up to the cabin, he said to Alice, "Here is your mansion".</p>
<p>

The cabin was small (14x16 feet) with a small cook <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../358/556358.xml">
stove</link>, a wooden <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/1122245.xml">
rocking chair</link>, few cooking utensils, bedding, and dishes. Boards were nailed into the wall for a bunk bed. Winter supplies were piled in the corner, and the south end of the room was reserved for the carpenter's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/231638.xml">
workbench</link> and tools. Anson made a turning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../993/149993.xml">
lathe</link> entirely of native wood, powered by a foot <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/2887653.xml">
treadle</link>. He made <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/48597.xml">
furniture</link> to trade for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/18940.xml">
meat</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../714/19714.xml">
milk</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/46593.xml">
hay</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/3075851.xml">
buckskin</link>. Anson was offered a school teaching position for fifteen to twenty students but gave the job to Bowen who had no other means of employment.</p>
<p>

Anson's brother Joe came with his families, and the following year they built the first framed buildings with shingle roofs. For several years Anson and Joe built many structures of importance in the valley. They were also partners in the first furniture store and machine company. Anson taught school in the winter and built buildings in the summer. In 1892 he designed and supervised the building of the Afton Ward chapel. That same year the Star Valley Stake of <denomination wordnetid="108146782" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../935/5935.xml">

 was organized with George Osmond as president, <link>
William Walton Burton</link> as first counselor, and Anson Vasco Call II as second counselor. In August 1904 the cornerstone was laid for a new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../935/82935.xml">
tabernacle</link>, and Anson served as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/1170.xml">
architect</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../461/1121461.xml">
builder</link>. The tabernacle was dedicated in August 1909. He also built and sold many homes in the area. He built one for his first family on the corner of Madison Street and 3rd Avenue, and he built a new home on Fifth Avenue for his wife Margaret.</p>
<p>

On September 13, 1901 and mass meeting of Afton citizens was held to select a committee to incorporate the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/52911.xml">
town</link>. Anson Vasco Call II, <link>
William Henry Kennington</link>, and <link>
Osborne Low</link> were selected. Anson Vasco Call II was elected the first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/101146.xml">
mayor</link> and began serving in 1902. In all, he served nine terms as Mayor of Afton (1902, 1903, 1904, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1924, 1925, and 1927).</p>
<p>

Anson personally supervised the installation of the first city <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/239918.xml">
water system</link> in 1913. He served for many years as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/4119011.xml">
