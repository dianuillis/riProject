. At various times in history they have also been termed <it>yunbian</it> (云扁) and <it>yunyaozi</it> (云窑子). Though technically Yunzi refers only to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/145020.xml">
sintered</link> stones made of "yunzi" material (the exact composition is a secret), the term can also sometimes connotate stones which are single-convex of any material. Yunzi-style stones made of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../395/191395.xml">
jade</link> for instance, were often presented to the reigning emperor and his court ancient China.

Yunzi are delicately made with a green luster yet are neither brittle nor slippery. The black and white pieces each have unique individual qualities. Old style white pieces are opaque with a tint of yellow or green. The black pieces are dark, and when held to the light have a translucent green hue.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Newer yunzi, however, have pure white stones.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

<p>

The production of yunzi started in the <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/43455.xml">

 and reached its peak in the <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 dynasties; the total verifiable history of <it>yunzi</it> spans at least five hundred years.

Among yunzi, most famous was the <it>yongzi</it> (永子) manufactured by Yongchang Fu (永昌府, today the city of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../719/13904719.xml">
Baoshan</link> in Yunnan) during the Ming dynasty. It was said that after a fire broke out in an imperial treasury, one of the keepers, who was from Yongchang Fu, discovered that melted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../007/24007.xml">
pearl</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../395/191395.xml">
jade</link> had a special luster. When he returned back to his hometown, he fashioned yunzi out of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/1523.xml">
agate</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../372/1372.xml">
amber</link> for which Yongchang Fu was famous. These yunzi went on to be prized by the literati and were offered to the Emperor.</p>
<p>

Yunzi also appeared frequently in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/153825.xml">
Chinese literature</link> as the subject of a number of verses penned over the years, being mentioned in works such as <it>Ming Yi Tong Zhi</it> (Ming Dynasty Comprehensive Geographic Survey) and Travels of Xu Xiake, both of which favored the yongzi.</p>
<p>

Today in Baoshan there are still people who have antiques dating from the Ming dynasty; among those there remain one and a half original yongzi sets.</p>
<p>

The yunzi have also been presented to international dignitaries including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/12153654.xml">
Queen Elizabeth II</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The traditional art of making yunzi was lost during the first few years of the 20th Century because of war in the region. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../550/34550.xml">

 examined the situation of yunzi while inspecting Yunnan. <chancellor wordnetid="109906986" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/50444.xml">

 also inquired about the possible reproduction of yunzi. The Yunnan Sports Commission investigated the Yunzi manufacturing processes and rediscovered the art.</p>
<p>

In 1974, the state-run Yunnan Weiqi Factory began manufacturing yunzi stones.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> They are used in professional weiqi tournaments in China and elsewhere. According to Chinese law, the yunzi stones can only be produced by the state run Yunzi company. The company creates the yunzi in an old factory that was used by the American <military_unit wordnetid="108198398" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../877/262877.xml">

 as barracks during World War II. The formula is thought to be ground Yunnan mountain stones and agate.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

 Caring for yunzi </st>
<p>

Like other types of stones, yunzi should be washed and dried with a gentle soap to remove any dust from the packaging/manufacturing process. In addition, they should be oiled with a light machine oil such as sewing machine oil or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/212419.xml">
baby oil</link> so that there are no health hazards. Vegetable oils, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/86190.xml">
canola</link> should never be used for this purpose. Like glass stones yunzi are very durable but one should take care never to drop or slam stones on metal or other hard surfaces to prevent chipping.</p>
