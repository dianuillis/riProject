industrialized nations</link>, but one of the rationales offered publicly to Western politicians at the time was that the Soviets had leapt ahead in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../237/84237.xml">

 and that science and technology would maintain the peace. Therefore, one specific area of attention was enhanced dissemination of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../618/406618.xml">
scientific literature</link> in order to maximize awareness of research and investigation already undertaken. At this point in time, such activities were documented through the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/37316.xml">

 corporation), called an urgent meeting of fourteen leading not-for-profit and government scientific Abstracting and Indexing (A&amp;I) services. Such services play a major role in managing the flow of scientific and scholarly communication and have done so since 1665 with the launch of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/5510345.xml">
Journal des Scavans</link>. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> The attending representatives agreed to a model for information dissemination that drew upon the strengths of both scholarly associations of scientists and researchers and government agencies. By working collaboratively, their efforts would support national scientific initiatives as well as promote the international advancement of science. In 1958, convinced of the value of mutual interaction and the interchange of ideas and expertise, a new organization–the National Federation of Science Abstracting and Indexing Services (NFSAIS)–was formed. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>[5] The organization in its earliest years provided reliable statistical information on journal publication activities, on overlap of information services, cost data, and the status of scientific information dissemination in other countries <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.</p>
<p>

The Federation expanded its scope in 1972 to encompass information producers outside of the scientific and technology sector. Eligibility for membership was widened in 1981 to include the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/251540.xml">
private for-profit sector</link>. Reflecting the advancement of technology and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../692/13692.xml">
emergence of the</link> Internet, as well as the changing nature of how research information is collected and archived, the name of the organization became the National Federation of Advanced Information Services in 2007.

In 1983, NFAIS created the title of Honorary Fellow to recognize those who have made significant contributions to NFAIS and no longer work for a member organization. This honorary designation has been awarded every year since then. A full list of those so honored by NFAIS may be found at:
