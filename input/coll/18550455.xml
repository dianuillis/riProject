<b>Knowledge Retrieval</b> is a field of study which seeks to return information in a structured form, consistent with human cognitive processes as opposed to simple lists of data items.  It draws on a range of fields including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../247/9247.xml">

 Overview </st>
<p>

In the field of retrieval systems, established approaches include:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Data Retrieval Systems (DRS), such as database management systems, are well suitable for the storage and retrieval of structured data. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/15271.xml">
Information Retrieval</link> Systems (IRS), such as web search engines, are very effective in finding the relevant documents or web pages that contain the information required by a user. </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

These approaches both require a user to read and analyze often long lists of data sets or documents in order to extract meaning implicit in them. </p>
<p>

The goal of knowledge retrieval systems is to reduce the burden of those processes by improved search and representation.  This improvement is seen as needed to handle the increasing volumes of data available on the world wide web and elsewhere.</p>
<p>

Many proposals and research efforts have been made regarding knowledge retrieval <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>.</p>

Knowledge retrieval (KR) focuses on the knowledge level. We need to examine how to extract, represent, and use the knowledge in data and information <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>. Knowledge retrieval systems provide knowledge to users in a structured way. They are different from data retrieval systems and information retrieval systems in inference models, retrieval methods, result organization, etc. Table 1, extending van Rijsbergen’s comparison of the difference between data retrieval
and information retrieval<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref>, summarizes the main characteristics of data retrieval, information retrieval, and knowledge retrieval<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>. The core of data retrieval and information retrieval are retrieval subsystems. Data retrieval gets results through Boolean match<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref>. Information retrieval uses partial match and best match. Knowledge retrieval is also based on partial match and best match. </p>
<p>

Considering inference perspective, data retrieval uses deductive inference, and information retrieval uses inductive inference<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>. Considering the limitations from the assumptions of different logics, traditional logic systems (e.g., Horn subset of first order logic) cannot make efficient reasoning in a reasonable time <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>. Associative reasoning, analogical reasoning and the idea of unifying reasoning and search may be effective methods of reasoning at the web scale <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref>.</p>
<p>

From retrieval model perspective, knowledge retrieval systems focus on semantics and better organisation of information. Data retrieval and information retrieval organize the data and documents by indexing, while knowledge retrieval organize information by indicating connections between elements in those documents.</p>

 Frameworks for Knowledge Retrieval systems</st>

<p>

From computer science perspective, In <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> a logic framework concentrating on fuzziness of knowledge queries has been proposed and investegated in detals. In <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> some markup language for knowledge reasoning and relevant strategies are investigated, which can be considered as possible logic reasoning foundations for text based knowledge retrieval.</p>
<p>

From cognitive science perspective, especially from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience perspective, In <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> and <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref>, the neurobiological basis for knowledge retrieval in the human brain is investigated, which serves as a cognitive model for knowledge retrieval.</p>
