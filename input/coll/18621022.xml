History</st>
<p>

DMAA: The Care Continuum Alliance formed in 1999 as an association to represent all <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../467/985467.xml">
stakeholders</link> in chronic condition care. The organization, originally called the Disease Management Association of America, announced a name change and new mission in September 2007 to reflect the expansion among its membership to services and products along the entire care continuum&mdash;from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/3964005.xml">
prevention (medical)</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../458/5367458.xml">
workplace wellness</link> to disease management to more complex interventions. (The organization now uses only the acronym, DMAA, and no longer refers to itself in any context by the earlier name.) Also in 2007, DMAA redefined this expanded care focus as "population health improvement" and published its Advancing the Population Health Improvement Model<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> to document the change.</p>
<p>

DMAA represents more than 200 corporate and individual members, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">
health plan</link>s and other payers; disease management organizations; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../458/5367458.xml">
workplace wellness</link> and prevention providers; pharmaceutical manufacturers and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/7855534.xml">
pharmacy benefit manager</link>s; health information technology companies; physicians, nurses and other health care professionals; employers and other purchasers; consultants; academicians; and researchers. DMAA is governed by a Board of Directors and a structure of committees, subcommittees and work groups. The organization maintains a professional staff in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../956/108956.xml">
Washington, D.C.</link></village>
, to perform day-to-day administration.</p>
<p>

In recent years, DMAA research activities have focused heavily on measuring outcomes in population-based interventions, such as disease management. In 2006, the group initiated a project to build industry consensus on measuring clinical and financial outcomes in population health improvement and published a first volume of its oft-cited "Outcomes Guidelines Report" in December of that year<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. In September 2007, DMAA produced a second volume<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>, with a greater emphasis on clinical outcomes (the first focused mainly on financial measures). A third volume, expanding on the first two and exploring new measurement areas, such as workplace wellness, is scheduled for publication in September 2008.</p>
