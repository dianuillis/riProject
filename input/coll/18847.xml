Overview</st>
<p>

Initial planning and development for Multics started in 1964. Originally it was a cooperative project led by <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18879.xml">
MIT</link></university>
 (with <link>
Fernando Corbató</link>) along with <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/12730.xml">
General Electric</link></company>
 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/3712.xml">
Bell Labs</link>. Bell Labs dropped out in 1969 and in 1970 GE's computer business including Multics was taken over by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../721/225721.xml">
Honeywell</link></company>
.</p>
<p>

Multics was conceived as a commercial product for GE and became one for Honeywell but not a very successful one. Due to its many novel and valuable ideas Multics had a great impact in the computer field even though it was then much derided by its critics.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

It had numerous features intended to result in high availability so that it would produce a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/1985147.xml">
computing utility</link> similar to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../003/30003.xml">
telephone</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../3$00/Radeon_R$300.xml">
electricity</link> services. Modular hardware structure and software architecture were used to achieve this. The system could grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource - computing power, main memory, disk storage, etc. Separate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/61589.xml">
Access Control List</link>s on every file provided flexible information sharing and complete privacy when needed. It had a number of standard mechanisms to allow engineers to analyse the performance of the system as well as a number of adaptive performance optimisation mechanisms.</p>

Novel ideas</st>


<p>

Multics implemented a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/8131170.xml">
single level store</link> for data access, discarding the clear distinction between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../077/7077.xml">
file</link>s (called <it>segments</it> in Multics) and <it><link>
process</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/25847.xml">
memory</link></it>.  The memory of a process consisted solely of segments which were mapped into its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../144/507144.xml">
address space</link>. To read or write to them, the process simply used normal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/5218.xml">
CPU</link> instructions, and the operating system took care of making sure that all the modifications were saved to <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<instrumentality wordnetid="103575240" confidence="0.8">
<medium wordnetid="106254669" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../472/Species_8472.xml">
disk</link></medium>
</instrumentality>
</artifact>
.  In <standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">
<system_of_measurement wordnetid="113577171" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../305/23305.xml">
POSIX</link></system_of_measurement>
</standard>
 terminology, it was as if every file was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/608709.xml">
mmap</link>()ed; however, in Multics there was no concept of <it>process memory</it>, separate from the memory used to hold mapped-in files, as <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/31642.xml">
Unix</link></family>
 has.  <it>All</it> memory in the system was part of <it>some</it> segment, which appeared in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../280/1010280.xml">
file system</link>; this included the temporary scratch memory of the process, its kernel stack, etc.</p>
<p>

One disadvantage of this was that the size of segments was limited to 256K 36-bit words (slightly more than 1 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/19918.xml">
megabyte</link>). This was due to the particular hardware architecture of the machines Multics ran on.  Extra code had to be used to work on files larger than this, called multisegment files. But in the days when one megabyte of memory was prohibitively expensive, and before large databases and later huge <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../326/13390326.xml">
bitmap</link> graphics, this limit was rarely encountered.</p>
<p>

Another major new idea of Multics was <link>
dynamic linking</link>, in which a running process could request that other segments be added to its address space, segments which could contain code that it could then execute.  This allowed applications to automatically use the latest version of any external routine they called, since those routines were kept in other segments, which were dynamically linked in only when a process first tried to begin execution in them.  Since different processes could use different <link>
search rules</link>, different users could end up using different versions of external routines automatically.  Equally importantly, with the appropriate settings on the Multics security facilities, the code in the other segment could then gain access to data structures maintained in a different process.</p>
<p>

Thus, to interact with an application running in part as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/458986.xml">
daemon</link> (in another process), a user's process simply performed a normal procedure call instruction, to a code segment which it had dynamically linked to (a code segment which implemented some operation associated with the daemon). The code in that segment could then modify data maintained and used in the daemon.  When the action necessary to commence the request was completed, a simple procedure return instruction returned control of the user's process to the user's code.</p>
<p>

The single-level store and dynamic linking are still not available to their full power in other widely used operating systems, despite the rapid and enormous advance in the computer field since the 1960s. They are becoming more widely accepted and available in more limited forms, e.g. dynamic linking.</p>
<p>

Multics also supported extremely aggressive on-line reconfiguration; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/5218.xml">
central processing unit</link>s, memory banks, disk drives, etc. could be added and removed while the system continued operating.  At the MIT system, where most early software development was done, it was common practice to split the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/64020.xml">
multiprocessor</link> system into two separate systems during off-hours by incrementally removing enough components to form a second working system, leaving the rest still running the original logged-in users.  System software development testing could be done on the second machine, then the components of the second system were added back onto the main user system, without ever having shut it down.  Multics supported multiple CPUs: it was one of the earliest multiprocessor systems.</p>
<p>

Multics was the first major operating system to be designed as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/7398.xml">
secure system</link> from the ground up. Despite this, early versions of Multics were broken into repeatedly.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  This led to further work that made the system much more secure and prefigured modern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/28730.xml">
security engineering</link> techniques.  Break-ins became very rare once the second-generation hardware base was adopted; it had hardware support for <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Multics was the first operating system to provide a hierarchical file system, and filenames could be of almost arbitrary length and syntax; a given file or directory could have multiple names (typically a long and short form); and symbolic links between directories were also supported.  It was the first to use the now-standard concept of per-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../178/45178.xml">

stack</link>s in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../394/50394.xml">

Project history</st>
<p>

Multics was developed initially for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../659/58659.xml">
GE-645</link> mainframe, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../064/920064.xml">
36-bit</link> system; later, it was supported on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../658/58658.xml">
Honeywell 6180</link> series machines.</p>
<p>

Bell Labs pulled out of the project in 1969; some of the people who had worked on it there went on to create the <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/31642.xml">
Unix</link></family>
 system. Superficial influence of Multics on Unix is evident in many areas, including the naming of commands. But the design philosophy was quite different, focusing on keeping the system small and simple, and so correcting the perceived deficiencies of Multics. The name "Unix" (originally "Unics") is itself a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../857/1158857.xml">
hack</link> on "Multics".  The U in UNIX is rumored to stand for "Uniplexed" as opposed to the "Multiplexed" of Multics, further underscoring the designers' rejections of Multics' complexity in favor of a more straightforward and workable approach.</p>

 bought GE's computer division, released a better hardware base, and continued system development until 1985. About 80 multimillion dollar sites were installed, at universities, industry, and government sites. The <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 university system had quite a few in the early 1980s. After Honeywell stopped supporting Multics, users migrated to other systems, including Unix.  The last Multics machine was shut down on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/22437.xml">

Retrospective observations</st>
<p>

It is startling that the permanently resident kernel of this powerful multiprocessor mainframe <it>computing utility</it>, much derided in its day as being too large and complex, was only 135 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../794/16794.xml">
kB</link> of code. The first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../061/19061.xml">
MIT</link> GE-645 had 512K words of memory (2 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/19918.xml">
MB</link>), a truly enormous amount at the time, and the kernel only used a moderate portion of Multics main memory.</p>
<p>

The entire system, including the operating system and the complex PL/I <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/5739.xml">
compiler</link>, user commands, and subroutine libraries, consisted of about 1500 source modules. These averaged roughly 200 lines of source code each, and compiled to produce a total of roughly 4.5 MB of procedure code, which though small today was fairly large by the standards of the day.</p>
<p>

Multics compilers generally optimised more for <link>
code density</link> than CPU performance, for example using small sub-routines called <it>operators</it> for short standard code-sequences, making direct comparison of object code size with more modern systems less useful. High code density was a good optimisation choice for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../751/39751.xml">
multi-user</link> system with expensive main memory, such as Multics.</p>
