<b>YouNoodle</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../728/49728.xml">
San Francisco</link>-based company providing a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/9156469.xml">
networking</link> website for small businesses. It has received particular attention for its "startup predictor", which aims to use mathematical models to predict the success of a new business based on information about its concept, finances, founders and advisers. The results include an estimate of the company's expected value after three years.

Startup predictor</st>
<p>

YouNoodle's "Startup predictor", developed by Makharinsky and Hwang, uses mathematical models to predict the success of new businesses.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> The user fills in a questionnaire, which takes about half an hour to complete and conentrates on the business' concept, finances, founders and advisers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Because the procedure is designed for very new companies, questions on revenue and traffic are not included.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> The site then provides an estimate of what the company's value will be after three years and a score from 1 to 1000 representing its value as an investment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> The service is free for the startups themselves, but YouNoodle intends to charge third parties for access to the results.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>  (The level of detail required by the questionnaire makes it difficult for people without inside knowledge of a company to provide the data for a prediction on their own.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>)</p>
<p>

The company's founders have declined to explain the algorithm in detail, but state that it takes into account the entrepeneurs' experience, networks and mutual relations. Information provided by companies which use the site's networking features is used to improve the algorithm.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> As of August 2008, the algorithm was based on data from 3,000 startups.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> In the same month the company had four <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/23273.xml">

<p>

In August 2008, YouNoodle predicted that its own value in 2010 would be $96 million.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> </p>

Preliminary reports on the service in February 2008 led to some skeptical reactions. Venture capitalist Paul S. Kedrosky told <it><newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../680/30680.xml">

, dismissed the idea as "hype and nonsense" and wrote that he would not even have covered it if not for the project's notable backers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Goodson responded to criticisms by stating that the process did not aim to "predict all the factors" affecting a company's success but to bring greater mathematical rigor to the type of assessment that investors were already making.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

When the predictor launched in August, Michael Arrington tested it using historical data about developed businesses. He found it underestimated the value of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/1092923.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/14855403.xml">
RockYou!</link></company>
 but correctly predicted major success in all four cases. For example, Slide.com, worth $550 million, was predicted to be worth $124 million. The site gave a much more accurate estimate for <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/13336054.xml">
Powerset</link></company>
 ($104 million compared to an actual $100 million), and Arrington suspected its estimate for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/9988187.xml">
Twitter</link> was "probably close to accurate". Arlington concluded that the predictions were "both interesting and accurate enough to be useful"; he was "still skeptical" and expressed concern that an algorithm based on past data might become outdated, but thought that if the system convinced others "it could become part of Silicon Valley culture".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> John Cook used available data and some guesses to acquire an estimated valuation of $152 million for <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../097/4035097.xml">

 in October 2008, compared this with an independent estimate of a $225 million value in April 2008, and concluded that YouNoodle's estimate was "in the ballpark".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
<p>

Scott D. Anthony, president of the consulting and investment company Innosight, argued that if YouNoodle were to succeed ("and that remains a big if") it might lead to "substantial change in the venture capital industry", comparable to the way <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/3842655.xml">
credit scores</link> affected the work of loan officers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> <writer wordnetid="110794014" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

, a journalist writing for VentureBeat, concluded based on the imprecise valuations in Arrington's tests that the scores out of 1,000 might be more useful for ranking the relative potential of different companies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Michelle Rodger gave the predictor a basically favorable assessment but noted the difficulty of quantifying "intellectual assets".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Liz Gunnison described it as "fun" but doubted its long-term potential.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

Richard Tyler, Enterprise Editor at <it><newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/172985.xml">
The Daily Telegraph</link></newspaper>
</it>, noted that most coverage had focused on the service's value to potential investigators. He suggested that while it could support an investment decision "ultimately determined by an experienced and well connected investor", it would be more useful in allowing the founders of a company to examine how changes in their team affected predicted outcomes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
