<b><it>Forensic Files</it></b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../088/Intel_8088.xml">

Production and broadcast history</st>
<p>

The series began on the <channel wordnetid="106259898" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../107/235107.xml">
TLC Network</link></channel>
 in 1995 as <b><it>Medical Detectives</it></b>. Old episodes of <it>Medical Detectives</it> now air on Tru TV under the <it>Forensic Files</it> label. Overseas, the show airs under these two titles, and others, on various channels in over 100 countries. It is distributed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/19620862.xml">
CABLEready</link>.</p>
<p>

Premiering just as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../945/3883945.xml">
O. J. Simpson murder trial</link> had focused attention on the world of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../955/7955.xml">
DNA</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/45710.xml">
forensics</link>, <it>Medical Detectives</it> became a hit. It was one of, if not <it>the</it> first of the popular forensic science shows. A few years later, Court TV snapped up the show and it quickly became the cornerstone of their primetime schedule, increasing its annual production run to 42 episodes.  The show was retained after the network was renamed TruTV in 2008.</p>
<p>

The show was so successful that, in 2002, <network wordnetid="108434259" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/21780.xml">
NBC</link></network>
 aired it as a summer replacement series.</p>

Weird Science</st>
<p>

The show helped pioneer documentary style crime-science shows.  The show's official web site says it profiles "puzzling, often baffling cases whose riddles are ultimately solved by forensic detection." The cases and people are real. Perhaps surprisingly, DNA testing is actually rarely focused on. While <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/212094.xml">
ballistics</link>, hair analysis, and fingerprinting do turn up, the show seems to prefer unusual evidence, such as animal hairs, plant analysis, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/184695.xml">
arson</link> investigation. Scientists and forensic experts in many fields are all interviewed.</p>
<p>

Not every case is a crime. In some cases, the investigation reveals that suspects are innocent, and the death was an accident or suicide. Several shows have profiled people who have been jailed for or convicted of a crime, and ultimately exonerated by forensic evidence.</p>
<p>

Although <it>"Medical Detectives"</it> also showed how outbreaks of mysterious illnesses were tracked (such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../945/416945.xml">
Hantavirus</link> and <disease wordnetid="114070360" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/67868.xml">
Legionellosis</link></disease>
), most of those have been dropped in favor of criminal cases (and occasionally civil cases) on TruTV.</p>

<st>
Show format</st>
<p>

The show takes a "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/69923.xml">
whodunit</link>" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every half-hour episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or suspects are all interviewed about their roles.</p>
<p>

Video of the lab tests is shot in a modernistic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../802/10802.xml">
film noir</link> style, in dark, moodily lit settings with odd, glowing colors. The crimes and parts of the investigation are re-enacted with actors in dramatic recreations. These recreations are indicated by a change in video style. In earlier episodes they were blurry and black &amp; white, and some appeared to actually be shot on film. More current shows use video that is in color, with letterboxing and a 'fuzzy' look. These recreations sometimes include alternate versions of the crime, which are eventually disproved by the science. This technique would later be appropriated, in a modified form, by the hit series -- essentially a fictionalized big-budget version of <it>Forensic Files</it>.</p>
<p>

In 2006 Forensic Files "Advanced" episodes began to air. This format takes previously released episodes and adds random extra bits of information related to the case previously left out. These bits of info are in the "pop-up" format reminiscent of <series wordnetid="108457976" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../815/958815.xml">
Pop-up Video</link></series>
 and often add interesting facts related to the case and those involved. These facts often have the ironic or "wow" element to them.</p>
