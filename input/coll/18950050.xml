<b>Black box</b> is a technical term for a device or system or object when it is viewed primarily in terms of its input and output characteristics.  Almost anything might occasionally be referred to as a black box: a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/30011.xml">
transistor</link>, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/682482.xml">
humans</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>.  <p>

The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection (such as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/10635.xml">
free software</link>/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../663/277663.xml">
open source</link> program), which is sometimes known as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/2288308.xml">
white box</link>, a glass box, or a clear box.

The modern term "black box" seems to have entered the English language around 1945.</p>
