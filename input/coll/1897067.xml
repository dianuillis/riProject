<p>

John Paul's obvious physical fitness and looks earned much comment in the media following his election, which compared his health and trim figure to the poor health of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/24027.xml">

</it> article in the 1980s labelled John Paul the "the keep-fit pope".</p>
<p>

However, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/30th_century.xml">
assassination</link> attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">

<p>

The 1981 assassination attempt was costlier to his overall health than was generally known by the public at the time. Rushed to the <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

colostomy</link>. Seven weeks later, discussions were held about reversing the colostomy and eight of nine doctors voted against it, arguing the Pope was still too weak from the CMV infection. Saying "I don't want to continue half dead and half alive", the Pope effectively overruled his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/23315.xml">
physician</link>s and the reversal was done successfully on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/1990.xml">

1981</link>.  Despite the shooting and the complications during recovery, John Paul remained in impressive physical condition throughout the 1980s, and remained active as well. During the 1990s John Paul's health began to decline. A benign intestinal tumor was removed from him in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../669/34669.xml">

 confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/6302185.xml">
Parkinson's disease</link>, as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../393/13393.xml">

encyclical</link>s. According to Williams, John Paul II showed no recognition . An aide whispered in the pope's ear, but was overheard reminding John Paul about the encyclical . However the Pope still showed no recognition. Papal critic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/551710.xml">
John Cornwell</link> claimed that, after Williams and his entourage left, the Pope turned to an aide and asked "tell me, who were those people?" <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Health_of_Pope_John_Paul_II#endnote_Cornwell">
