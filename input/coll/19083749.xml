<b>Level of detail</b> in writing, sometimes known as level of abstraction, refers to three concepts: the precision in using the right <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../866/1449866.xml">
word</link>s to form <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/44975.xml">
phrase</link>s, clauses and sentences<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>; the generality of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../768/17642768.xml">
statements</link>; and the organisational strategy in which authors <link>
arrange</link> ideas according to a common topic in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../998/13998.xml">
hierarchy</link> of detail. Placing different objects or ideas in categories is a type of classification in <link>
expert writing</link> which allows more efficient cognitive retrieval of information by placing it in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../537/3261537.xml">
context</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Maintaining appropriate level of detail in any body of text is a part of ensuring that the cognitive effort required by the reader is appropriate to the general subject of the written as a whole. Authors use level of detail to maintain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../899/5899.xml">
continuity</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/1674289.xml">
syntactic hierarchy</link> in texts, such as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/83597.xml">
screenplay</link>s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Continuity in text is achieved by using <link>
transitional expressions</link> to move from one detail, or level of detail, to another.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><p>

Within the basic writing structure of <it>introducing</it>, <it>characterising</it> and <it>bringing to a close</it> of any proper subject description<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>, level of detail is used in <link>
theme development</link> during <it>elaboration</it>, <it>evaluation</it> and <it>adding context</it> as a repertoire of retrieval strategies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>  Van der Pool in 1995 had found that omission of detail in text structuring is an age-related effect that differentiates mature and young writers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> </p>
<p>

Although the general rule that the level of detail must be both sufficient and appropriate
for the author's audience and their subject in literature intended for experts<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>, it is also used in primary and secondary education to assess student understanding.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> In general the depth of detail is gradually developed to one appropriate for the subject.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> </p>
<p>

The suggested list in identifying appropriate level of detail may include<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Presenting the reader with specific details without first introducing it with general statements can be dangerous because it omits a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../058/210058.xml">
qualifier</link>, and therefore introduces elements that invite questions and create confusion.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> </p>
<p>

Level of detail is often important in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/1219301.xml">
technical writing</link> due to the need to differentiate between different levels of audience need for information within the organisation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

Similar to the engineering design process, writing also takes place by the author usually adopting either a top-down or a bottom-up press by identifying components of the text that become the focus subjects in the overall <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/699908.xml">
theme</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
<p>

The content of a text is often assessed for its level of detail as <it>high</it>, <it>intermediate</it> or <it>low</it> based on the objective of the author in addressing the needs of the audience. The highly detailed text refers to the bottom-up structuring design where 
Facts that are generally available but not used frequently (and likely to be forgotten) should be included in this ideal level of writing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>
This level of detail is appropriate for the subjects where expert specialist knowledge and understanding are required, and is often used in technical and scientific writing, or in literary genres like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../787/26787.xml">
science fiction</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../562/7370562.xml">
biographical writing</link>  or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/20031.xml">
military history</link>.</p>
