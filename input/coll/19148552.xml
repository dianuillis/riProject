 Simulation Tools </st>

<p>

nanoHUB provides in-browser simulation tools geared toward nanotechnology, electrical engineering, chemistry, and semiconductor education.  nanoHUB simulations are available to users as both stand-alone tools and part of structured teaching and learning curricula comprising numerous tools.  As of 9/18/2008, nanoHUB hosts 124 distinct simulation tools<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.  nanoHUB users develop and contribute their own tools for live deployment. </p>
<p>

Examples of some tools include:</p>
<p>

<b>SCHRED</b>, which calculates the envelope wavefunctions and the corresponding bound-state energies in a typical MOS (Metal-Oxide-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/27709.xml">
Semiconductor</link>) or SOS (Semiconductor-Oxide-Semiconductor) structure and a typical SOI structure by solving self-consistently the one-dimensional (1D) Poisson equation and the 1D <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../874/59874.xml">
Schrodinger equation</link>.</p>
<p>

<b>Quantum Dot Lab</b>, which computes the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../429/2161429.xml">
eigenstates</link> of a particle in a box of various shapes including domes and pyramids.</p>
<p>

<b>Bulk Monte Carlo Tool</b>, which calculates the bulk values of the electron <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../919/200919.xml">
drift velocity</link>, electron <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/312252.xml">
average energy</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../994/760994.xml">
electron mobility</link> for electric fields applied in arbitrary crystallographic direction in both column 4 (Si and Ge) and III-V (GaAs, SiC and GaN) materials.</p>
<p>

<b>Crystal Viewer</b>  helps in visualizing various types of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../808/661808.xml">
Bravais lattices</link>, planes and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../079/1089079.xml">
Miller indices</link> needed for many material, electronics and chemistry courses. Also large bulk systems for different materials (Silicon, InAs, GaAs, diamond, graphene, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/10628.xml">
Buckyball</link>) can be viewed using this tool.</p>
<p>

<b>Band Structure Lab</b> which uses the sp3s*d5 tight binding method to compute E(k) for bulk, planar, and nanowire semiconductors. Using this tool, researchers may compute and visualize the <link>
band structures</link> of bulk semiconductors, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../036/1033036.xml">
thin films</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/52206.xml">
nanowires</link> for various materials, growth orientations, and strain conditions. Physical parameters such as the bandgap and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../706/156706.xml">
effective mass</link> can also be obtained from the computed E(k). The bandedges and effective masses of the bulk materials and the nanostructures structures can be analyzed as a function of various strain conditions.</p>

 RAPPTURE Toolkit </st>

<p>

The Rappture toolkit (RapidAPPlication infrastrucTURE) provides the basic infrastructure for the development of a large class of scientific applications, allowing scientists to focus on their core algorithm. It does so in a language-neutral fashion, so one may access Rappture in a variety of programming environments, including C/C++, Fortran and Python. To use Rappture, a developer describes all of the inputs and outputs for the simulator, and Rappture generates a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/12293.xml">
Graphical User Interface</link> (GUI) for the tool automatically <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
 Workspaces </st>

<p>

A workspace is an in-browser Linux desktop that provides access to NCN's Rappture toolkit, along with computational resources available on the NCN, Open Science Grid, and TeraGrid networks. One can use these resources to conduct research, or as a development area for new simulation tools. One may upload code, compile it, test it, and debug it. Once code is tested and working properly in a workspace, it can be deployed as a live tool on nanoHUB.</p>
<p>

A user can use normal Linux tools to transfer data into and out of a workspace. For example, sftp yourlogin@sftp.nanohub.org will establish a connection with a nanoHUB file share.  Users can also use built-in webdav support on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems to access theier nanoHUB files on a local desktop.</p>

<st>
 Middleware </st>

<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/33455.xml">
web server</link> uses a daemon to dynamically relay incoming <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../541/351541.xml">
VNC</link> connections to the execution host on which an application session is running. Instead of using the port router to set up a separate channel by which a file import or export operation is conducted, it uses VNC to trigger an action on the browser which relays a file transfer through the main nanoHUB web server. The primary advantage of consolidating these capabilities into the web server is that it limits the entry point to the nanoHUB to one address: www.nanohub.org. This simplifies the security model as well as reduces on the number of independent security certificates to manage.</p>
<p>

One disadvantage of consolidating most communication through the web server is the lack of scalability when too much data is transfered by individual users. In order to avoid a network traffic jam, the web server can be replicated and clustered into one name by means of DNS round-robin selection.</p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../089/5211089.xml">
OpenVZ</link></software>
. For each system, a VNC server is pre-started for every session. When OpenVZ is used, that VNC server is started inside of a virtual container. Processes running in that container cannot see other processes on the physical system, see the CPU load imposed by other users, dominate the resources of the physical machine, or make outbound network connections. By selectively overriding the restrictions imposed by OpenVZ, it is possible to synthesize a fully private environment for each application session that the user can use remotely. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

 Usage </st>

<p>

The majority of users come from academic institutions using nanoHUB as part of their research and educational activities.  Users also come from national labs and private industry. 
As a scientific resource, nanoHUB is cited over 260 times in the scientific literature <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>.  Approximately 60 percent of the citations stem from authors not affiliated with the NCN. Over 200 of the citations refer to nanotechnology research, with over 150 of them citing concrete resource usage.  20 citations elaborate on nanoHUB use in education and over 30 refer to nanoHUB as an example of a national cyberinfrastructure.  The goals of this cyberinfrastructure are to enhance the scientific discovery process, as well as enable new venues for discovery throughout the scientific community <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>.</p>
