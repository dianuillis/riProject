<b>Brainboost</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/548297.xml">
metasearch engine</link> designed to provide specific answers to questions asked in natural language. Currently it only supports English.<p>

The Brainboost engine uses <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/233488.xml">
machine learning</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../652/21652.xml">
natural language processing</link> AI techniques to answer the questions.</p>
<p>

Traditional engines return the links to the <it>pages</it> that appear most relevant. Additionally the results page may include a summary of the page. The user then needs to download the pages and read them to see if the answer to his question is in fact there.</p>
<p>

Brainboost however works along the following steps:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 a user types in a question</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Using the question Brainboost generates a number of different queries that it submits to traditional "dumb" search engines</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Brainboost downloads top several hundred pages returned by the search engines</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 It reads the pages, locates and isolates the answers in the text of these pages</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Brainboost ranks the different answers based on its <it>AnswerRank</it> algorithm and displays them to the user starting from the best ones</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The engine is best suited to relatively common questions that might have been already discussed somewhere on the Web in one form or another. In some Brainboost may fail to produce an answer for a particular query, but for many questions the engine produces a number of great answers.</p>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../872/3053872.xml">
December 2005</link>, Brainboost was acquired by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/1462185.xml">
Answers Corporation</link>.</p>
