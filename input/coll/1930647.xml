January 19</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/34672.xml">
1956</link>) is an American <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../014/149014.xml">
televangelist</link>.  He is best known for his coined screaming of "GOD!!" or "NOW!!" while he is preaching on television.

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/244098.xml">

.  He makes regular appearances on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/4936474.xml">

Most of his teachings revolve around the ordering and use of "prayer handkerchiefs," "olive oil soap," and "personal prayer packages" as a guaranteed way to make a miracle manifest in someone's life.  In fact, he claims that bathing in the "olive oil soap" can cure people of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../516/5069516.xml">
AIDS</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link>, and common aches and pains.  Other miracles he claims have occurred through his ministry are the delivery of unexpected payments that appear for no reason and the resolve of marital troubles. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.kerneythomas.org/test_main.html">
http://www.kerneythomas.org/test_main.html</weblink>.  For example, one woman at a Thomas' crusade claimed that she desperately needed a job and a separation from her abusive husband.  After calling Thomas, she claimed that 25 minutes later she received a job offer from a security company that she had not even applied at.  Some time later, she received news that her husband had been unexpectedly "shipped back to <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/8087628.xml">

," and he could not return to the United States for 10 years. A video of a miracle crusade can be seen here <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.kerneythomas.org/videostream.html">

<p>

Thomas also proclaims himself to be a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/24805.xml">
prophet</link> of God and encourages viewers of his broadcasts to send him money in exchange for miracles from God comparable to <nongovernmental_organization wordnetid="108009834" confidence="0.8">

 they (Israelites) didn't go to the pastor; they came to the prophet." He often quotes the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../390/3390.xml">
Bible</link> scripture , which talks of the special miracles God allowed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/24140.xml">
Apostle Paul</link> to perform through the use of aprons and handkerchiefs. This scripture is used as the basis of his distribution of "Bible Red Blood of Jesus" prayer handkerchiefs.  Thomas also uses airtime to ask for donations to his ministry for crusades to <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

.  Thomas also airs taped footage of himself claiming to heal people at "miracle crusades." </p>
<p>

He makes use of an extensive home mailing system in which he sends generic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../242/1951242.xml">
form letter</link>s to those who have called in to his automated phone system. Callers leave their name and mailing address and are sent a red prayer handkerchief.  After twenty-four hours, callers are told to send the handkerchief back to Thomas with their name and phone number written on it, so it becomes a "point of contact."</p>
<p>

Like many other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/23555.xml">
Pentecostals</link>, Thomas is a regular practitioner of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../327/12327.xml">
glossolalia</link>. He often does this on his television program and screams and shouts in a high-pitched voice when answering calls from his "Miracle Prayer Line," where he invites people who are having medical, financial and family problems to call in.  After the caller explains their problem and Thomas prays for them, some callers claim that they were healed instantaneously over the phone. Like Robert Tilton, Thomas' unusual preaching style has lent itself to various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/11240.xml">
flatulence</link>-ridden parody videos on the internet.</p>
