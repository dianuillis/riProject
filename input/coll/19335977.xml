Luthans was one of the first management scholars to apply <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../303/1589303.xml">
behavioral science</link> to better understanding and effectively manage <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/563299.xml">
human behavior</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/105070.xml">
organizations</link>. This evolved into the now widely recognized discipline of <link>
organizational behavior</link>, by far the largest division in the <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../040/15460040.xml">

. His book Organizational Behavior. (now going into its 12th edition), is generally recognized as the first mainline text (1973) in this field.</p>

In the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../557/34557.xml">
1980s</link>, Luthans conducted rare observational research to answer the questions of “What do managers really do in their day-to-day activities?”; “What do successful managers (those who rise rapidly in their organizations) really do?”; and “What do effective managers (those who have satisfied and committed employees and high quantity and quality outcomes in their units) really do?” This led to his third book Real Managers (1988). His research found that the relatively most frequently observed activity contributing to managers’ success was their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network</link> skills (defined behaviorally from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/980435.xml">
naturalistic observation</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../667/620667.xml">
methodology</link> to be socializing/politicking and interacting with outsiders). Effective managers, on the other hand, were observed to give relatively most frequent attention to communicating and human resource management activities, with networking given the least attention. This finding that managers who were successful exhibited quite different activities than did their effective counterparts challenged conventional wisdom that promotions are based on doing activities that result in effective outcomes. This research empirically demonstrated the importance of playing the game (networking and politicking) in order to get ahead in organizations.</p>
<p>

In the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/34556.xml">
1990s</link>, with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/46313.xml">
globalization</link> taking the forefront in the management field, Luthans’ research took on an international focus and resulted in his next major book (co-authored with now deceased Richard Hodgetts and now Jonathan Doh) International Management (1991, now in its seventh edition). Luthans previous work in both behavioral management and managerial activities were tested in other cultures, mainly Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>

In recent years, drawing from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../948/179948.xml">
positive psychology</link> movement and his own early research on positive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../960/211960.xml">
reinforcement</link> and, with former doctoral student Alex Stajkovic, on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/2632897.xml">
self-efficacy</link> (their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/62329.xml">
meta-analysis</link> published in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/34647.xml">
1998</link> indicating a very strong relationship between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/2632897.xml">
self-efficacy</link> and work-related performance is one of the most cited in the entire field), Luthans has initiated, defined, built theory and conducted research on what he terms <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/17439110.xml">
positive organizational behavior</link> or simply POB. With former doctoral student Carolyn Youssef and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/327937.xml">
University of Nebraska</link> colleague <link>
Bruce Avolio</link>, this work has resulted in his latest book Psychological Capital (2007). </p>
<p>

This <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../765/17179765.xml">
positive psychological capital</link> or simply PsyCap is made up of positive psychological resources of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/2632897.xml">
self-efficacy</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/50020.xml">
hope</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../988/295988.xml">
optimism</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/3735409.xml">
psychological resilience</link>. These four PsyCap components have been determined to best meet his POB definitional criteria of being theory/research-based, having valid measurement, being state-like/open to development, and having performance impact. Luthans and colleagues research has demonstrated that this PsyCap is a higher order, core construct. Each of the four dimensions has been found to load onto the overall core factor of PsyCap, which in turn has been more consistently related to both performance and satisfaction than each of the individual components. The key differentiator between PsyCap and most other positive constructs is that it is “state-like” and open to development. Luthans and colleagues (especially former doctoral student James Avey) research has demonstrated that, compared to randomly assigned control groups, PsyCap can be developed in relatively short (2-3 hour) intervention workshops. Luthans and colleagues utility analysis of investing in and developing psychological capital has to date yielded a very high (over 200% in one study) what they call return on development (ROD). This work on PsyCap has resulted in Luthans receiving the 2008 Outstanding Research and Creative Activity (ORCA)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. Award from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/327937.xml">
