 and their students and colleagues, Gail has, since the 1980s, developed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/3056879.xml">
adaptive resonance theory</link> (ART) family of neural networks for fast stable online learning, pattern recognition, and prediction, including both unsupervised (ART 1, ART 2, ART 2-A, ART 3, fuzzy ART, distributed ART) and supervised (ARTMAP, fuzzy ARTMAP, ART-EMAP, ARTMAP-IC, ARTMAP-FTR, distributed ARTMAP, default ARTMAP) systems. These ART models have been used for a wide range of applications, including remote sensing, medical diagnosis, automatic target recognition, mobile robots, and database management.</p>

She is the first woman to receive the IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award. She has been elected to successive three-year terms on the Board of Governors of the International Neural Network Society (INNS) since its founding, in 1987, and received the INNS Gabor Award. She has also served as an elected member of the Council of the American Mathematical Society, and is a charter member of the Association for Women in Mathematics.</p>
