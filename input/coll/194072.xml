<b>Collective action</b> is the pursuit of a goal or set of goals by more than one person. It is a term which has formulations and theories in many areas of the social sciences.
<sec>
<st>
In sociology</st>
<p>

As an explanation of social movements, an inquiry into collective action involves examining those factors that cause the setting of standards of social integration, as well as those factors which lead to standards of deviance and conflict. An explanation of a collective action in sociology will involve the explanation of those things which are similar or dissimilar to collective actions at different times and in different places. Theories of collective action emphasise how group behavior can, in some sense, be linked to social <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../833/294833.xml">
institution</link>s.</p>

The economic theory of <b>collective action</b> is concerned with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/8879931.xml">
provision</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/173155.xml">
public good</link>s (and other collective consumption) through the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/303330.xml">
collaboration</link> of two or more individuals, and the impact of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/61193.xml">
externalities</link> on group behavior. It is more commonly referred to as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/51256.xml">
Public Choice</link>. The foundational work in collective action in the economic sense was <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Olson's theory explores the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/68754.xml">
market failure</link>s where individual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/83042.xml">
consumer rationality</link> and firms' profit-seeking do not lead to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/582932.xml">
efficient</link> provision of the public goods, i.e. where another level of provision would provide a higher <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/45479.xml">
utility</link> at a lower cost.  </p>
<p>

Note, however, that the theory is not necessarily a challenge to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../909/308909.xml">

. It only limits the domain in which that principle applies: for purely <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../275/1139275.xml">

 leads to situations where individuals with more resources will carry a higher burden in the provision of the public good than poorer ones. Poorer individuals will usually have little choice but to opt for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/52217.xml">
free rider</link> strategy, i.e. they will attempt to benefit from the public good without contributing to its provision. This also encourages the under-production (inefficient production) of the public good.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
Institutional design</st>
<p>

While public goods are often provided by governments, this is not always the case.  Various institutional designs have been studied with the aim of reducing the collaborative failure.  The best design for a given situation depends on the production costs, the utility function, and the collaborative effects, amongst other things.  Here are only some examples:</p>

<ss2>
<st>
Joint products</st>
<p>

A joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good.  For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be tied to a donation to a charity (public good).</p>
<p>

It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Club</st>
<p>

Some institutional design, e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../724/14724.xml">
intellectual property rights</link>, can introduce an exclusion mechanism and turn a pure <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/173155.xml">
public good</link> into an impure public good artificially. </p>
<p>

If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/303330.xml">
collaboration</link>, clubs can emerge.  <economist wordnetid="110043643" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../515/57515.xml">
James M. Buchanan</link></person>
</economist>
 showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.</p>
<p>

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/21754.xml">
nation</link> can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens.  Government would then be the manager of this club.  This is further studied in the <link>
Theory of the State</link>.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Federated structure</st>
<p>

In some cases, theory shows that collaboration emerges spontaneously in smaller groups rather than in large ones (see e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/2678638.xml">
Dunbar's number</link>). This explains why <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/17626.xml">

<p>

Over the past twenty years or so analytic philosophers have been exploring the nature of collective action in the sense of acting together, as when people paint a house together, go for a walk together, or together execute a pass play. These particular examples have been central for three of the philosophers who have made well known contributions to this literature:<physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

, respectively. </p>
<p>

In Gilbert (1989) and subsequent articles and book chapters including Gilbert (2006, chapter 7) Gilbert argues for an account of collective action according to which this rests on a special kind of interpersonal commitment, what Gilbert calls a "joint commitment". A joint commitment in Gilbert's sense is not a matter of a set of personal commitments independently created by each of the participants, as when each makes a personal decision to do something. Rather, it is a single commitment to whose creation each participant makes a contribution. Thus suppose that one person says "Shall we go for a walk?" and the other says "Yes, let's". Gilbert proposes that as a result of this exchange the parties are jointly committed to go for a walk, and thereby obligated to one another to act as if they were parts of a single person taking a walk. Joint commitments can be created less explicitly and through processes that are more extended in time. One merit of a joint commitment account of collective action, in Gilbert's view, is that it explains the fact that those who are out on a walk together, for instance, understand that each of them is in a position to demand corrective action of the other if he or she acts in ways that affect negatively the completion of their walk. In Gilbert (2005) she discusses the pertinence of joint commitment to collective actions in the sense of the theory of rational choice.</p>
<p>

In Searle (1990) Searle argues that what lies at the heart of a collective action is the presence in the mind of each participant of a "we-intention". Searle does not give an account of we-intentions or, as he also puts it, "collective intentionality", but insists that they are distinct from the "I-intentions" that animate the actions of persons acting alone.</p>
<p>

In Bratman (1993) Bratman proposed that, roughly, two people "share an intention" to paint a house together when each intends that the house is painted by virtue of the activity of each, and also intends that it is so painted by virtue of the intention of each that it is so painted. That these conditions obtain must also be "common knowledge" between the participants.</p>
<p>

Discussion in this area continues to expand, and has influenced discussions in other disciplines including anthropology, developmental psychology, and economics. One general question is whether it is necessary to think in terms that go beyond the personal intentions of individual human beings properly to characterize what it is to act together. Bratman's account does not go beyond such personal intentions. Gilbert's account, with its invocation of joint commitment, does go beyond them. Searle's account does also, with its invocation of collective intentionality. The question of whether and how one must account for the existence of mutual obligations when there is a collective intention is another of the issues in this area of inquiry.</p>
