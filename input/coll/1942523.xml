64-bit</link> versions of Windows available—before this, these operating systems only  existed in 32-bit versions. <p>

The <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/48364.xml">
architecture</link> of Windows NT</b> is highly modular and consists of two main layers: components that run in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../467/93467.xml">
user mode</link> and components that run in <link>
kernel mode</link>. Programs and subsystems in user mode are limited in terms of what system resources they have access to, while the kernel mode has unrestricted access to the system memory and external devices. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../394/50394.xml">
kernels</link> of the operating systems in this line are all known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../041/4345041.xml">
hybrid kernel</link>, although this term is disputed arguing that all essential parts of the system execute in kernel mode making it a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/20825.xml">
monolithic kernel</link> that is structured somewhat like a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/20023.xml">
microkernel</link>. The architecture comprises a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Kernel%22])">
simple kernel</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../511/425511.xml">
hardware abstraction layer</link> (HAL), drivers, and a range of services (collectively named <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Executive%22])">
Executive</link>), which all exist in kernel mode.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

User mode in the Windows NT line is made of subsystems capable of passing I/O requests to the appropriate kernel mode <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/9101.xml">
software driver</link>s by using the I/O manager.  Two subsystems make up the user mode layer of Windows NT:  the Environment subsystem (which runs applications written for many different types of operating systems), and the Integral subsystem (operates system specific functions on behalf of the environment subsystem).  Kernel mode in Windows NT has full access to the hardware and system resources of the computer.  The kernel mode stops user mode services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system that they should not have access to.</p>
<p>

The Executive interfaces with all the user mode subsystems.  It deals with I/O, object management, security and process management.  The kernel sits between the Hardware Abstraction Layer and the Executive to provide <it>multiprocessor synchronization</it>, thread and interrupt scheduling and dispatching, and trap handling and exception dispatching.  The kernel is also responsible for initializing device drivers at bootup. Kernel mode drivers exist in three levels: highest level drivers, intermediate drivers and low level drivers.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../077/252077.xml">
Windows Driver Model</link> (WDM) exists in the intermediate layer and was mainly designed to be binary and source compatible between <version wordnetid="107173585" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../941/33941.xml">

.  The lowest level drivers are either legacy Windows NT device drivers that control a device directly or can be a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/158859.xml">
PnP</link> hardware bus.</p>

<sec>
<st>
User mode</st>
<p>

The user mode is made up of subsystems which can pass I/O requests to the appropriate kernel mode drivers via the I/O manager (which exists in kernel mode).  Two subsystems make up the user mode layer of Windows NT: the <it>Environment subsystem</it> and the <it>Integral subsystem</it>.</p>
<p>

The environment subsystem was designed to run applications written for many different types of operating systems.  None of the environment subsystems can directly access hardware, and must request access to memory resources through the Virtual Memory Manager that runs in kernel mode.  Also, applications run at a lower priority than kernel mode processes.  </p>
<p>

There are three main environment subsystems: the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/81601.xml">
Win32</link> subsystem, an <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The Win32 environment subsystem can run 32-bit Windows applications. It contains the console as well as text window support, shutdown and hard-error handling for all other environment subsystems. It also supports <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/1501173.xml">

thread</link> to run on.  However, Windows NT does allow users to run a Win16 program in a separate Win16 VDM, which allows the program to be preemptively multitasked as Windows NT will pre-empt the whole VDM process, which only contains one running application. The Win32 environment subsystem process (csrss.exe) also includes the window management functionality, sometimes referred to as a "window manager." It handles input events (such as from the keyboard and mouse), then passes messages to the applications that need to receive this input. Each application is responsible for drawing or refreshing its own windows and menus, in response to these messages. </entry>

Kernel mode</st>
<p>

Windows NT <link>
kernel mode</link> has full access to the hardware and system resources of the computer and runs code in a protected memory area.   It controls access to scheduling, thread prioritization, memory management and the interaction with hardware.   The kernel mode stops user mode services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system that they should not have access to; user mode processes must ask the kernel mode to perform such operations on their behalf. </p>
<p>

While the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/34198.xml">
x86</link> architecture supports four different privilege levels (numbered 0 to 3), only the two extreme privilege levels are used. Usermode programs are run with CPL 3, and the kernel runs with CPL 0. These two levels are often referred to as "ring 3" and "ring 0", respectively. Such a design decision had been done to achieve code portability to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/3963672.xml">
RISC</link> platforms that only support two privilege levels,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> but is most likely also contributed to the fact that even "ring 2" is already powerful enough to allow for privilege escalation to "ring 0" (for example by modifying I/O bitmaps).</p>
<p>

Kernel mode consists of <it>executive services</it>, which is itself made up on many modules that do specific tasks, <it>kernel drivers</it>, a <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../394/50394.xml">
kernel</link></it> and a <it>Hardware Abstraction Layer</it>, or HAL. </p>

The Executive interfaces with all the user mode subsystems.  It deals with I/O, object management, security and process management. It's informally divided into several <it>subsystems</it>, among which <it>Cache Manager</it>, <it>Configuration Manager</it>, <it>I/O Manager</it>, <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../625/2714625.xml">

</it>, <it>Process Structure</it> and <it>Security Reference Monitor (SRM)</it>.   Grouped together, the components can be called <it>Executive services</it> (internal name <it>Ex</it>). <it>System Services</it> (internal name <it>Nt</it>), i.e., <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/102908.xml">

<p>

The term "service" in this context generally refers to a callable routine, or set of callable routines. This is distinct from the concept of a "service process," which is a user mode component somewhat analogous to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/458986.xml">

Object creation is a process in two phases, <it>creation</it> and <it>insertion</it>. <it>Creation</it> causes the allocation of an empty object and the reservation of any resources required by the object manager, such as an (optional) name in the namespace. If creation was successful, the subsystem responsible for the creation fills in the empty object.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Finally, if the subsystem deems the initialization successful, it instructs the object manager to <it>insert</it> the object, which makes it accessible through its (optional) name or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../333/425333.xml">

Handles are similar in purpose to UNIX <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/608754.xml">

Starting from Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, the memory manager implements a so-called <it>session space</it>, a range of kernel-mode memory that is subject to context switching just like user-mode memory. This lets multiple instances of the kernel-mode Win32 subsystem and GDI drivers run side-by-side, despite shortcomings in their initial design. Each session space is shared by several processes, collectively referred to as a "session".

Citrix</link>) as a prerequisite for their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/1852072.xml">
terminal server</link> product for Windows NT, called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/1558081.xml">
WinFrame</link>. Starting with Windows Vista, though, sessions finally became a proper aspect of the Windows architecture. No longer a memory manager construct that creeps into user mode indirectly through Win32, they were expanded into a pervasive abstraction affecting most Executive subsystems. As a matter of fact, regular use of Windows Vista always results in a multi-session environment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>

Kernel</st>
<p>

The kernel sits between the HAL and the Executive and provides multiprocessor synchronization, thread and interrupt scheduling and dispatching, and trap handling and exception dispatching; it is also responsible for initializing device drivers at bootup that are necessary to get the operating system up and running. That is, the kernel performs almost all the tasks of a traditional microkernel; the strict distinction between Executive and Kernel is the most prominent remnant of the original microkernel design, and historical design documentation consistently refers to the kernel component as "the microkernel".</p>
<p>

The kernel often interfaces with the process manager.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> The level of abstraction is such that the kernel never calls into the process manager, only the other way around (save for a handful of corner cases, still never to the point of a functional dependence).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Kernel-mode drivers</st>
<p>

Windows NT uses kernel-mode <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/9101.xml">
device driver</link>s to enable it to interact with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../310/5310.xml">
hardware device</link>s. Each of the drivers has well defined system routines and internal routines that it exports to the rest of the operating system. All devices are seen by user mode code as a file object in the I/O manager, though to the I/O manager itself the devices are seen as device objects, which it defines as either file, device or driver objects. Kernel mode drivers exist in three levels: highest level drivers, intermediate drivers and low level drivers. The highest level drivers, such as file system drivers for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../045/53045.xml">
FAT</link> and <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">
<artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<instrumentality wordnetid="103575240" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/39184.xml">

</artifact>
</system>
, rely on intermediate drivers. Intermediate drivers consist of function drivers—or main driver for a device—that are optionally sandwiched between lower and higher level filter drivers. The function driver then relies on a bus driver—or a driver that services a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../631/6631.xml">
bus</link> controller, adapter, or bridge—which can have an optional bus filter driver that sits between itself and the function driver. Intermediate drivers rely on the lowest level drivers to function. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../077/252077.xml">
Windows Driver Model</link> (WDM) exists in the intermediate layer. The lowest level drivers are either legacy Windows NT device drivers that control a device directly or can be a PnP hardware bus. These lower level drivers directly control hardware and do not rely on any other drivers.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Hardware abstraction layer</st>
<p>

The Windows NT <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../511/425511.xml">
hardware abstraction layer</link>, or HAL, is a layer between the physical hardware of the computer and the rest of the operating system. It was designed to hide differences in hardware and therefore provide a consistent platform on which the kernel is run. The HAL includes hardware-specific code that controls I/O interfaces, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/1805419.xml">
interrupt controller</link>s and multiple processors.</p>
<p>

However, despite its purpose and designated place within the architecture, the HAL isn't a layer that sits entirely below the kernel, the way the kernel sits below the Executive: all known HAL implementations depend in some measure on the kernel, or even the Executive. In practice, this means that kernel and HAL variants come in matching sets that are specifically engineered to work together.</p>
<p>

In particular, hardware abstraction does <it>not</it> involve abstracting the instruction set, which generally falls under the wider concept of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../666/3755666.xml">
portability</link>. Abstracting the instruction set, when necessary (such as for handling the several revisions to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/34198.xml">
x86</link> instruction set, or emulating a missing math coprocessor), is performed by the kernel, or via platform <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/18311356.xml">
virtualization</link>.</p>
