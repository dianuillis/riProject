<b>Harry Fainlight</b> (1935-1982) was a British/American poet associated with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/157208.xml">
Beats</link> movement.<p>

He was the younger brother of <translator wordnetid="110725280" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

 (b 1931), also a poet, who edited a posthumous volume of his work, <it>Selected Poems</it>, published in 1986.</p>

Educated at English grammar schools and Cambridge University, where he was contemporary with <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, Fainlight was a precocious youth who admired the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/157208.xml">
Beat poets</link> and published in English magazines like <it>Encounter</it> from his early twenties. Dual citizenship gave him the opportunity to travel freely to the US and view heroes such as <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 at first-hand. He stayed in New York for three years from 1962. During his sojourn there, Ginsberg called him, “the most gifted English poet of his generation”, and Fainlight contributed to Fuck You, a radical arts magazine published by Ed Sanders (see also <musical_organization wordnetid="108246613" confidence="0.8">

). </p>
<p>

Like Ginsberg, Fainlight was Jewish, fundamentally homosexual, and a keen experimenter with drugs. While in America his work included a poem, Mescaline Notes and a disturbing epic about a bad LSD trip, The Spider. </p>
<p>

Fainlight returned to London in the spring of 1965; there, small imprint, Turret Books, issued the only volume published in England in his lifetime, <it>Sussicran</it>, a slim 12-page pamphlet. The title is “Narcissus” reversed.</p>

When Ginsberg visited London in June 1965 and read at Better Books in Charing Cross Road, the event was so popular, shop manager <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 and Gregory Corso who were due in the city. Ginsberg’s girlfriend of the time, Barbara Rubin, asked which was the largest venue in London. Miles’s wife mentioned the Royal Albert Hall. Rubin spontaneously booked the 7000-seat venue for 10 days later. </p>
<p>

Incredibly, for a modern poetry reading, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../429/8661429.xml">
International Poetry Incarnation</link> was more than sold out. It was, says Miles - in Stephen Gammond’s film,<it> A Techniclour Dream</it> (2008) – “like a poetry rave,” the first sign of many like-minds being interested in “underground’ art <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. </p>

Harry Fainlight was one of 17 poets booked to appear alongside Ginsberg. His awkward performance, his spasming mouth hampered by having taken amphetamines, can be seen in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../622/10377622.xml">
Peter Whitehead</link>’s film of the event, <it>Wholly Communion</it> (1965). The packed hall takes against the young poet as he stumbles through The Spider and is interrupted by Dutch writer <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

Politically, it is only the work of those three years which they wish to exploit. And the formulae of exploitation are very profitable &amp; so they keep on repeating them. But they have become more &amp; more irrelevant to the whole of my work; those years exist in it only as a body of water, a lake in a far greater surrounding land mass. Certainly they are not where I live. I am saying all this because there is still no one who really cares enough to be responsible for my work; to protect it from the inroads of philistinism. If you do not, it encourages the philistine movement.”</p>

Fainlight never sustained a significant relationship, never lived with anyone and was, according to his sister, “in and out of mental hospitals all his adult life."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>  He committed suicide in 1982.</p>
