<b>Techmeme</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../816/29816.xml">
technology</link> news <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/2351677.xml">
aggregator</link>. The website has been described as "a one-page, aggregated, filtered, archiveable summary in near real-time of what is new and generating conversation".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Overview</st>

<link>
Gabe Rivera</link> was a compiler programmer at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/14617.xml">
Intel</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> before launching tech.memeorandum on September 12, 2005 after working on it for a year; it was later renamed to Techmeme. The website is funded entirely by Rivera, and has no investors;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> it's only employee, besides Rivera, is Omer Horvitz.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

Website</st>
<p>

Techmeme uses an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> to order stories by importance, which depends on several factors that include the number of links to the story's web page and how old the story is. "Anti-gaming" efforts have been made to lower the effect that a high number of links can have on a story if the links were created in a short period of time, or by a small number of people. The website has a Techmeme Sponsors Program which accepts payment in exchange for a dedicated section for sponsors.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/4059023.xml">
search engine</link> was added to the website on May 20, 2008, which searches all archived stories that have appeared on the website as a full headline.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Two weeks later, a "prospective search feature" was added to Techmeme, which allows users to subscribe to future search results and receive notifications when a headline matches their search pattern.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Technology</st>
<p>

Techmeme works by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/2696619.xml">
scraping</link> news websites and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/33645.xml">
blog</link>s, and then compiles a list of links to the most popular technology-related news of the day, which is continuously updated. The stories selected are all chosen by an automated process. The service is fed a list of websites, and then it finds other websites that are similar to these, to find similar news stories and to keep the focus on technology news. Once the website finds sources that provide a good source of technology news, they are added to Techmeme's database so that it can track them for future updates. Rivera has suggested that website owners link to other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../063/34063.xml">
web page</link>s when possible because it increases the chances that Techmeme will find their website.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
