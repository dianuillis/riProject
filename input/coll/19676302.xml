<b>The Rational Data Industry Model</b> is overseen by Rational Data International, an umbrella company. The industry model is designed to be self-supporting, synergistic, and complementary on a number of different levels. One of its significant strengths is its integrated holism. It produces both the platform and specialized vehicles with which to view a new kind of information-based cyberspace. </p>
<p>

Industry Models differ from business models in that they are based on source or core technologies and are capable of providing numerous business models. In general new industry models bring new paradigms in the marketplace. Industry models are not aptly described by elevator pitches. Industry models are closely related to what is known as a blue ocean strategy.</p>
<p>

A general case industry model consists of a number of components, these include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>

1) technology process flows</p>
<p>

2) managerial process flows</p>
<p>

3) supply chain models</p>
<p>

4) distribution models</p>
<p>

5) technology transfer models</p>
<p>

6) enabling technologies</p>
<p>

7) frameworks and standards</p>
<p>

<b>Core Technologies:</b></p>
<p>

The industry model is based on core technologies that implement <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/7581389.xml">

<p>

These technologies encompass but are not limited to:</p>
