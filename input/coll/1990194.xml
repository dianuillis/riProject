Although it was rumored that Hogg had a sister named "Ura Hogg", she had only brothers. Hogg's father left public office in 1895, and soon after, her mother was diagnosed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/30653.xml">

In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for disturbed children and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940.

 in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.</p>

<p>

Ima Hogg later recounted that "my grandfather Stinson lived fifteen miles [24&nbsp;km] from Mineola and news traveled slowly. When he learned of his granddaughter's name he came trotting to town as fast as he could to protest but it was too late. The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to remain."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, "my good name".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>  Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a scrawl that left her first name illegible.  Her personal stationery was usually printed "Miss Hogg" or "I. Hogg", and she often had her stationery order placed in her secretary's name to avoid questions.  Hogg did not use a nickname until several months before her death, when she began calling herself "Imogene".  Her last passport was issued to "Ima Imogene Hogg".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

Contrary to popular belief, Ima did not have a sister named Ura.  Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for re-election as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura.  Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>  She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>  <it><newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</it> even invented another sister, Hoosa.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>  </p>
<p>

In the early 1930s, Hogg worked on a collection of her father's papers and speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C. Cotner; she became a guardian of his place in history, often writing to clarify or refute articles published about her father.  According to Bernhard, "the very fact that Ima had been burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing politeness."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>

Hogg and her younger brothers were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along the center of the railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home. Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she "never had the patience to succeed".  Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../884/11884.xml">

The children liked animals, and their menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref>  The children once used their animals to conduct a circus on the grounds of the Governor's Mansion.  Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref>  In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill to their collection of animals.  In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a slingshot.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref>  Ima and her ostriches later became the protagonists of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../021/166021.xml">

Her mother never regained her strength after Thomas's birth, and for the remainder of her life was a semi-invalid.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref> Ima accompanied her to several health spas during their years in Austin.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref>  In 1895, Sarah was diagnosed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/30653.xml">

<p>

Davis accompanied the family to Austin and spent several months caring for Hogg and her brothers. Davis, who had lost her husband to tuberculosis and watched her son fight the disease, believed that Hogg must have contracted the disease from her mother. Davis instructed Ima to never marry so as not to pass on the illness. By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a boarding school in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/151124.xml">
San Marcos</link>.  The following year, they returned to Austin to live with their father.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref>  Although the family employed a housekeeper, Hogg was considered the lady of the house and supervised the housecleaning as well as the education of her younger brothers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref>  In 1898, Hogg accompanied her father to <symbol wordnetid="106806469" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she "had an awful feeling".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref>  He relented and they instead sailed to California, where they learned that their original ship had been lost at sea with no survivors.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref></p>

On January 26, 1905, Jim Hogg suffered an injury in a train accident.

Description and disposition</st>
<p>

David Warren, the first curator of Bayou Bend, said Hogg was "small and dainty and feminine—and smart and sharp and knowledgeable—all rolled into one".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2296%22])">96</ref>
Her biographer Bernhard described her as "elegantly and stylishly dressed", 5&nbsp;feet 2&nbsp;inches (157&nbsp;cm) tall and of fair complexion,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2297%22])">97</ref> "independent and self-possessed" and noted that she could "sugarcoat her single-mindedness with layers of charm".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2298%22])">98</ref>  At the age of 81, she was described by <it>The New York Times</it> as a "blue-eyed strawberry blonde".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2299%22])">99</ref></p>
<p>

One morning in 1914, Hogg was awakened by a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was attempting to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but "wrote down a name and address, handed it to him and told him to go there that very day to get a job".  When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, "He didn't look like a bad man."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22100%22])">100</ref>  Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone.  While she was en route, <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../693/7955693.xml">

 was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, England declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22101%22])">101</ref></p>
<p>

Though Bernard describes Hogg as a woman of "unfailing politeness",<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> the biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday featuring the elderly pianist <artist wordnetid="109812338" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<pianist wordnetid="110430665" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

</artist>
,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2267%22])">67</ref> he characterized her as a "tiresome old woman". Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as "a pompous old man". By contrast, Hogg said of <artist wordnetid="109812338" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
