<b>Mac OS</b> is the trademarked name for a series of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/12293.xml">

, usually referred to simply as the <b>System</b> software.</p>
<p>

Apple deliberately downplayed the existence of the operating system in the early years of the Macintosh to help make the machine appear more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/288276.xml">
user-friendly</link> and to distance it from other operating systems such as <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/20027.xml">

, which were portrayed as arcane and technically challenging. Much of this early system software was held in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/18934934.xml">
ROM</link>, with updates typically provided free of charge by Apple dealers on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../891/10891.xml">
floppy disk</link>. As increasing disk storage capacity and performance gradually eliminated the need for fixing much of an advanced GUI operating system in ROM, Apple explored cloning while positioning major operating system upgrades as separate revenue-generating products, first with System 7 and System 7.5, then with Mac OS 7.6 in 1997.</p>

-based Macintoshes. As Apple introduced computers with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../281/24281.xml">
PowerPC</link> hardware, the OS was upgraded to support this architecture as well. Mac OS X, which has superseded the "Classic" Mac OS, is compatible with both PowerPC and Intel processors.</p>

<p>

The early Macintosh operating system initially consisted of two pieces of software, called "System" and "Finder", each with its own version number.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/345354.xml">

-based systems, significant parts of the system were stored in physical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/18934934.xml">
ROM</link> on the motherboard. The initial purpose of this was to avoid using up the limited storage of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../891/10891.xml">
floppy disk</link>s on system support, given that the early Macs had no <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/13777.xml">
hard disk</link>. (Only one model of Mac was ever actually bootable using the ROM alone, the 1991 <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 model.) This architecture also allowed for a completely graphical OS interface at the lowest level without the need for a text-only console or command-line mode. A fatal software error, or even a low-level hardware error discovered during system startup (such as finding no functioning disk drives), was communicated to the user graphically using some combination of icons, alert box windows, buttons, a mouse pointer, and the distinctive Chicago bitmap font. Mac OS depended on this core system software in ROM on the motherboard, a fact that later helped to ensure that only Apple computers or licensed clones (with the copyright-protected ROMs from Apple) could run Mac OS.</p>

The Mac OS can be divided into two families of operating systems:

The "classic" Mac OS is characterized by its total lack of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/6707.xml">
command line</link>; it is a completely graphical operating system. Noted for its ease of use and its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../857/6857.xml">
cooperative multitasking</link>, it was criticized for its very limited <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/299617.xml">
memory management</link>, lack of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/515373.xml">
protected memory</link>, and susceptibility to conflicts among operating system "extensions" that provide additional functionality (such as networking) or support for a particular device. Some extensions may not work properly together, or work only when loaded in a particular order. Troubleshooting Mac OS extensions can be a time-consuming process of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/245733.xml">
trial and error</link>.</p>

<p>

Most file systems used with DOS, Unix, or other operating systems treat a file as simply a sequence of bytes, requiring an application to know which bytes represented what type of information. By contrast, MFS and HFS gave files two different "forks". The data fork contained the same sort of information as other file systems, such as the text of a document or the bitmaps of an image file. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/146655.xml">
resource fork</link> contained other structured data such as menu definitions, graphics, sounds, or code segments. A file might consist only of resources with an empty data fork, or only a data fork with no resource fork. A text file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information in the resource fork, so that an application, which didn’t recognize the styling information, could still read the raw text. On the other hand, these forks provided a challenge to interoperability with other operating systems; copying a file from a Mac to a non-Mac system would strip it of its resource fork, necessitating such encoding schemes as <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

.</p>
<p>

Classic Application Support was shipped with Mac OS X with PowerPC Macs until early 2006. However, Intel-based Macintoshes cannot run the Classic system or applications, nor can PowerPC models while they are running Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard.</p>

It is also the second Macintosh operating system to include a command line (the first is the now-discontinued <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

However, since these new features put higher demands on system resources, Mac OS X only officially supported the <chip wordnetid="103020034" confidence="0.8">

PowerPC builds of Mac OS X include a compatibility layer for running older Mac applications, the <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/56892.xml">
Classic Environment</link></software>
. This runs a full copy of the older Mac OS, version 9.1 or later, in a Mac OS X process. PowerPC-based Macs shipped with Mac OS 9.2 as well as Mac OS X. Mac OS 9.2 had to be installed by the user — it was not installed by default on hardware revisions released after the release of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/641975.xml">
Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger</link>. Most well-written "classic" applications function properly under this environment, but compatibility is only assured if the software was written to be unaware of the actual hardware, and to interact solely with the operating system. The Classic Environment is not available on Intel-based Macintoshes due to the incompatibility of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/205635.xml">
Mac OS 9</link> with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/34198.xml">
x86</link> hardware, and was removed completely on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/2001664.xml">
Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</link>.</p>
<p>

Users of the classic Mac OS generally upgraded to Mac OS X, but many criticized it as being more difficult and less user-friendly than the original Mac OS, for the lack of certain features that had not been re-implemented in the new OS, or for being slower on the same hardware (especially older hardware), or other, sometimes serious incompatibilities with the older OS. Because drivers (for printers, scanners, tablets, etc.) written for the older Mac OS are not compatible with Mac OS X, and due to the lack of Mac OS X support for older Apple machines, a significant number of Macintosh users have still continued using the older classic Mac OS. But by 2005, it has been reported that almost all users of systems capable of running Mac OS X are doing so, with only a small fraction still running the classic Mac OS. </p>

One interesting historical aspect of the classic Mac OS was a relatively unknown secret prototype Apple started work on in 1992, code-named "Star Trek" (as in "to boldly go"). The goal of this project was to create a version of Mac OS that would run on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/14617.xml">
Intel</link>-compatible <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../198/34198.xml">

The project was short lived, being canceled only one year later in early 1993. There are two theories for the cancellation: the first is that Apple's board canceled further development upon realizing that going with Star Trek would mean an entirely new business model and one that would likely see a notable drop in Apple's lucrative hardware sales; and the second is that an x86 Mac OS was not commercially viable in the early nineties because <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

A further complication was that Star Trek was designed to be source-level compatible, not binary compatible, with the Mac OS. Mac applications would therefore have to be recompiled or rewritten by their developers to run on the x86 architecture, and there was much skepticism as to exactly how much work this would entail.</p>
<p>

Fifteen years after Star Trek, support for the x86 architecture was officially included in Mac OS, and then <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/2020710.xml">
Apple transitioned</link> all desktop computers to the x86 architecture. This was not the direct result of earlier Project Star Trek efforts. The <link>
 Darwin</link> underpinning used for Mac OS X 10.0 and later included support for the x86 architecture. The remaining non-Darwin portion of Mac OS X (based on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/53114.xml">
OPENSTEP</link>, which ran on Intel processors) was released officially with the introduction of x86 Macintosh computers.</p>

 series of processors, and as such most couldn't run versions of the Mac OS that succeeded 8.1, which required PowerPC processors. Most also required a Mac ROM image or a hardware interface supporting a real Mac ROM chip; those requiring an image are of dubious legal standing as the ROM image may infringe on Apple's intellectual property.</p>
<p>

A notable exception was the Executor commercial software product from Abacus Research &amp; Development, the only product that exclusively used 100% reverse engineered code without the use of Apple technology. It ran extremely fast but never achieved more than a minor subset of functionality. Few programs were completely compatible and many were extremely crash-prone if they ran at all. Executor filled a niche market for porting 68000 classic Mac applications to x86 platforms; development ceased in 2002 and the project is now defunct.</p>
<p>

Emulators using Mac ROM images offered near complete Mac OS compatibility and later versions offered excellent performance as modern x86 processor performance increased exponentially.</p>
<p>

Unfortunately most of the Mac user base had already started moving to the PowerPC platform that offered excellent classic Mac backward compatibility on 8.xx &amp; 9.xx operating systems along with faster PowerPC software support. This helped ease the transition to PowerPC-only applications while prematurely obsolescing 68000 emulators and the Classic-only applications they supported well before these emulators were refined enough to compete with a real Mac.</p>

PowerPC emulation</st>
<p>

At the time of 68000-emulator development PowerPC support was difficult to justify not only due to the emulation code itself but also the anticipated wide performance overhead of an emulated PowerPC architecture vs. a real PowerPC based Mac. This would later prove correct with the start of the PearPC project even years later despite the availability of 7th &amp; 8th generation x86 processors employing similar architecture paradigms present in the PowerPC. Many application developers were also creating and releasing both 68000 Classic and PowerPC versions concurrently helping to negate the need for PowerPC emulation. PowerPC Mac users who could technically run either obviously chose the faster PowerPC applications. Soon Apple was no longer selling 68000-based Macs and the existing installed base started to quickly evaporate. Despite the eventual excellent 68000-emulation technology available they proved never to be even a minor threat to real Macs due to their late arrival and immaturity even several years after the release of much more compelling PowerPC based Macs.</p>

 emulator is capable of emulating the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../281/24281.xml">
PowerPC</link> processors required by newer versions of the Mac OS (like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/20640.xml">
Mac OS X</link>). Unfortunately, it is still in the early stages and, like many emulators, tends to run much slower than a native <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> would.</p>
<p>

During the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors, Apple realized the need to incorporate a PowerPC emulator into Mac OS X in order to protect its customers' investments in software designed to run on the PowerPC. Apple's solution is an emulator called <link>
Rosetta</link>. Prior to the announcement of Rosetta, industry observers assumed that any PowerPC emulator running on an x86 processor would suffer a heavy performance penalty (e.g., PearPC's slow performance). Rosetta's relatively minor performance penalty therefore took many by surprise.</p>
