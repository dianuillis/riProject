<b>Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA)</b> (or <b>probabilistic safety assessment/analysis</b>) is a systematic and comprehensive methodology to evaluate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/25617.xml">
risk</link>s associated with a complex engineered technological entity (such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/51215.xml">
airliner</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/207347.xml">
nuclear power plant</link>s).<p>

Risk in a PRA is defined as a feasible detrimental outcome of an activity or action.  </p>
<p>

In a PRA, risk is characterized by two quantities: 
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

the magnitude (severity) of the possible adverse consequence(s), and </entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of each consequence.  </entry>
</list>

Consequences are expressed numerically (e.g., the number of people potentially hurt or killed) and their likelihoods of occurrence are expressed as probabilities or frequencies (i.e., the number of occurrences or the probability of occurrence per unit time).  The total risk is the sum of the products of the consequences multiplied by their probabilities. The spectrum of risks across classes of events are also of concern, and are usually controlled in licensing processes - (it would be of concern if rare but high consequence events were found to dominate the overall risk.)</p>
<p>

Probabilistic Risk Assessment usually answers three basic questions:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

What can go wrong with the studied technological entity, or what are the initiators or initiating events (undesirable starting events) that lead to adverse consequence(s)?</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

What and how severe are the potential detriments, or the adverse consequences that the technological entity may be eventually subjected to as a result of the occurrence of the initiator?</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

How likely to occur are these undesirable consequences, or what are their probabilities or frequencies?</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Two common methods of answering this last question are Event Tree Analysis and <link>
Fault Tree Analysis</link> - for explanations of these, see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/29278.xml">
safety engineering</link>.</p>
<p>

In addition to the above methods, PRA studies require special but often very important analysis tools like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/1724415.xml">
human reliability</link> analysis (HRA) and common-cause-failure analysis (CCF). HRA deals with methods for modeling <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/4584639.xml">
human error</link> while CCF deals with methods for evaluating the effect of inter-system and intra-system dependencies which tend to cause simultaneous failures and thus significant increases in overall risk.</p>
<p>

PRA studies have been successfully performed for complex technological systems at all phases of the life cycle from concept definition and pre-design through safe removal from operation.  For example, the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/165201.xml">
Nuclear Regulatory Commission</link></agency>
 required that each <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/207347.xml">
nuclear power plant</link> in the US perform an Individual Plant Examination (IPE) <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/individual-plant-examination-ipe.html">
http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/individual-plant-examination-ipe.html</weblink> to identify and quantify plant vulnerabilities to hardware failures and human faults in design and operation. Although no method was specified for performing such an evaluation, the NRC requirements for the analysis could be met only by applying PRA methods.</p>
