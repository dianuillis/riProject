<p>

According to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/3399613.xml">
OpenNet Initiative</link> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.opennetinitiative.net/burma/">
http://www.opennetinitiative.net/burma/</weblink>, FortiGuard is used by the dictatorship of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/19457.xml">
Myanmar</link> to block communications critical of the regime carried over the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
internet</link>, a system known as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../697/8307697.xml">
Myanmar Wide Web</link> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://webapp.mcis.utoronto.ca/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=32">
http://webapp.mcis.utoronto.ca/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=32</weblink>. Fortinet has promised to investigate the allegations, and the implied violation of US Government sanctions against the regime, noting that the software may have been sold to the regime by a third party <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2144178/fortinet-investigates-sanctions">
http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2144178/fortinet-investigates-sanctions</weblink>; meanwhile, the Myanmar government features its adoption of the Fortinet firewall on its official website <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2004/May04/enlm/May16_h1.html">
http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2004/May04/enlm/May16_h1.html</weblink> with other photos showing a Fortinet sales director presenting a gift to the Myanmar Prime Minister during a ceremony <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2004/May04/enlm/May16_h1.html">
http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2004/May04/enlm/May16_h1.html</weblink>. In 2005, after becoming aware that its product may have reached Myanmar, Fortinet conducted an exhaustive review of channel partners and their compliance with import/export controls.  The company implemented additional back-end controls which now render a product useless if it is diverted without appropriate authorizations to a party located in a U.S. sanctioned country <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-151656919.html">
http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-151656919.html</weblink>. </p>
<p>

In 2005, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../657/3399657.xml">
gpl-violations.org</link> project uncovered evidence that Fortinet had used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../683/18938683.xml">
GPL</link> code in its products against the terms of the license, and used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/18934432.xml">
cryptographic</link> tools to conceal the violation. The violation was alleged to have occurred in the <it>FortiOS</it> system, which the gpl-violations.org project said contained elements of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/6097297.xml">
linux</link> kernel. In response, a <location wordnetid="100027167" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../058/19058.xml">

 court granted a temporary injunction against the company, preventing it from selling products until they were in compliance with the necessary license terms <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://gpl-violations.org/news/20050414-fortinet-injunction.html">
http://gpl-violations.org/news/20050414-fortinet-injunction.html</weblink>; Fortinet was forced to make their FortiOS available free in compliance with GPL licensing <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ftp.gpl-devices.org/pub/vendors/Fortinet/20050514/">
http://ftp.gpl-devices.org/pub/vendors/Fortinet/20050514/</weblink>.Also in 2005 Fortinet was found guilty of Patent infringement against Trend Micro regarding AntiVirus code <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.trendmicro.com/en/about/news/pr/archive/2005/pr051305.htm">
http://www.trendmicro.com/en/about/news/pr/archive/2005/pr051305.htm</weblink>. Fortinet later settled out of court <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/16/fortinet_trend_micro_patent_lawsuit/">
