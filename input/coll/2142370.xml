<b>WASH-1400, 'The Reactor Safety Study</b>' was a report produced in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../752/34752.xml">
1975</link> for the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 by a committee of specialists under Professor <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../563/16819563.xml">
Norman Rasmussen</link>.  It is thus often referred to as the <b>Rasmussen Report</b>.  The report is now considered obsolete (see the disclaimer to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/3440139.xml">
NUREG-1150</link>) and it and similar studies are being replaced by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../584/19137584.xml">
State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses</link> study.<p>

WASH-1400 considered the course of events which might arise during a serious accident at a (then) large modern <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

. It estimated the radiological consequences of these events, and the probability of their occurrence, using a fault tree/event tree approach. This technique is called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/2080354.xml">
Probabilistic Risk Assessment</link> (PRA).  The report concluded that the risks to the individual posed by nuclear power stations were acceptably small, compared with other tolerable risks.  Specifically, the report concluded, using the methods and resources and knowledge available at the time, that the probability of a complete core meltdown is about 1 in 20,000 per reactor per year.  </p>
<p>

The study was peer-reviewed by the 'Lewis Committee' in 1977, which broadly endorsed the methodology as the best available, but cautioned that the risk figures were subject to large uncertainty.</p>
<p>

The methods used were comparatively simple and overly-pessimistic by today's standards, and based on early understanding of key phenomenology. Following a period of intensive (and expensive) research and discussion, inspired in part by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../486/1750486.xml">
Three Mile Island</link>, WASH-1400 was replaced in due course first by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/3440139.xml">
NUREG-1150</link> and now by a new study being performed by the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/165201.xml">

 called the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA)<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/research/soar.html">
http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/research/soar.html</weblink>. Specific Studies were also made of two plants at Zion and Indian Point - the so called Z/IP Study.</p>
<p>

The PRA methodology became generally followed as part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/4222539.xml">
safety-assessment</link> of all modern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/207347.xml">
nuclear power plant</link>s.  In the 1990s, all US nuclear power plants submitted PRAs to the NRC under the Individual Plant Examination program <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/individual-plant-examination-ipe.html">
http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/individual-plant-examination-ipe.html</weblink>, and five of these were the basis for the 1991 NUREG-1150.</p>
<p>

WASH-1400 is now NUREG-75/014.</p>
