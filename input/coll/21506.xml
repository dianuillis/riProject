<b>Numerical analysis</b> is the study of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>s for the problems of <it>continuous mathematics</it> (as distinguished from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../492/8492.xml">
discrete mathematics</link>).<p>

One of the earliest mathematical writings is the Babylonian tablet YBC 7289, which gives a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/135316.xml">
sexagesimal</link> numerical approximation of <math>\sqrt{2}</math>, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>
Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to compute square roots) is extremely important, for instance, in carpentry and construction.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In a rectangular wall section that is 2.40 meter by 3.75 meter, a diagonal beam has to be 4.45 meters long.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation to <math>\sqrt{2}</math>, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.</p>
<p>

Numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/8297.xml">

Before the advent of modern computers numerical methods often depended on hand <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../569/14569.xml">
interpolation</link> in large printed tables. Nowadays (after mid 20th century) these tables have fallen into disuse, because computers can calculate the required functions.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../569/14569.xml">

<ss1>
<st>
History</st>

<p>

The field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/160010.xml">
Linear interpolation</link> was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

</activity>
</procedure>
</psychological_feature>
</act>
</rule>
</event>
, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/217523.xml">
Lagrange interpolation polynomial</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/13035.xml">
Gaussian elimination</link>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/3011098.xml">
Euler's method</link>.</p>
<p>

To facilitate computations by hand, large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients.  Using these tables, often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions, one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions.  The canonical work in the field is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../888/21888.xml">
NIST</link> publication edited by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../236/1206236.xml">
Abramowitz and Stegun</link>, a 1000-plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points.  The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available, but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy.</p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../636/13636.xml">
mechanical calculator</link> was also developed as a tool for hand computation. These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s, and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes. But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis, since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done.</p>

We conclude from this table that the solution is between 1.875 and 2.0625. The algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0.2.</p>

 Discretization and numerical integration </st>

<p>

<image location="right" width="125px" src="Schumacher_(Ferrari)_in_practice_at_USGP_2005.jpg">

In a two hour race, we have measured the speed of the car at three instants and recorded them in the following table.</p>
<p>

Time  0:20 1:00 1:40
km/h  140  150  180 </p>
<p>

A <b>discretization</b> would be to say that the speed of the car was constant from 0:00 to 0:40, then from 0:40 to 1:20 and finally from 1:20 to 2:00. For instance, the total distance traveled in the first 40 minutes is approximately (2/3h x 140 km/h)=93.3 km. This would allow us to estimate the total distance traveled as 93.3 km + 100 km + 120 km = 313.3 km, which is an example of <b>numerical integration</b> (see below) using a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/176478.xml">
Riemann sum</link>, because displacement is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../532/15532.xml">
integral</link>of velocity.</p>
<p>

<b>Ill posed problem</b>: Take the function <it>f</it>(<it>x</it>) = 1/(<it>x</it>&nbsp;&amp;minus;&nbsp;1). Note that <it>f</it>(1.1) = 10 and <it>f</it>(1.001) = 1000: a change in <it>x</it> of less than 0.1 turns into a change in <it>f</it>(<it>x</it>) of nearly 1000. Evaluating <it>f</it>(<it>x</it>) near <it>x</it> = 1 is an ill-conditioned problem.</p>
<p>

<b>Well-posed problem</b>: By contrast, the function <math>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</math> is continuous and so evaluating it is well-posed.</p>

Direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps. These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../662/48662.xml">
infinite precision arithmetic</link>. Examples include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/13035.xml">
Gaussian elimination</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/436189.xml">
QR</link> factorization method for solving <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../087/113087.xml">

 is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution (assuming <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../807/233807.xml">
stability</link>).</p>
<p>

In contrast to direct methods, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../237/15237.xml">
iterative method</link>s are not expected to terminate in a number of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../779/349779.xml">
converge</link> to the exact solution only in the limit. A <link>
convergence criterion</link> is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even in infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution in finitely many steps (in general). Examples include <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/646651.xml">
bisection method</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../104/4047104.xml">
Jacobi iteration</link>. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.</p>
<p>

Iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis. Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not, e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../521/4329521.xml">
GMRES</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/1448821.xml">
conjugate gradient method</link>. For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Discretization</st>

<p>

Furthermore, continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called <it>discretization</it>. For example, the solution of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/1424309.xml">
differential equation</link> is a function. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a continuum.</p>

</ss1>
</sec>
<sec>
<st>
The generation and propagation of errors</st>

<p>

The study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis. There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem. </p>

<ss2>
<st>
Round-off</st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../450/432450.xml">
Round-off error</link>s arise because it is impossible to represent all <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/19725491.xml">
real number</link>s exactly on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/10931.xml">
finite-state machine</link> (which is what all practical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/7878457.xml">
digital computer</link>s are).</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Truncation and discretization error</st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../056/229056.xml">
Truncation</link> errors are committed when an iterative method is terminated and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/516070.xml">
discretization error</link> because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of <math>3x^3+4=28</math>, after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.</p>
<p>

Once an error is generated, it will generally propagate through the calculation. For instance, we have already noted that the operation + on a calculator (or a computer) is inexact. It follows that a calculation of the type a+b+c+d+e is even more inexact.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Numerical stability and well posedness</st>

<p>

This leads to the notion of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../807/233807.xml">
numerical stability</link>: an algorithm is numerically stable if an error, once it is generated, does not grow too much during the calculation. This is only possible if the problem is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/6934.xml">
well-conditioned</link>, meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount. Indeed, if a problem is ill-conditioned, then any error in the data will grow a lot.</p>
<p>

However, an algorithm that solves a well-conditioned problem may or may not be numerically stable.  An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well-posed mathematical problem. For instance, computing the square root of 2 (which is roughly 1.41421) is a well-posed problem. Many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation <it>x</it>1 to <math>\sqrt{2}</math>, for instance <it>x</it>1=1.4, and then computing improved guesses <it>x</it>2, <it>x</it>3, etc... One such method is the famous <link>
Babylonian method</link>, which is given by <it>xk</it>+1 = <it>xk</it>/2 + 1/<it>xk</it>. Another iteration, which we will call Method X, is given by <it>xk</it> + 1 = (<it>xk</it>2&amp;minus;2)2 + <it>xk</it>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> We have calculated a few iterations of each scheme in table form below, with initial guesses <it>x</it>1 = 1.4 and <it>x</it>1 = 1.42.</p>

Observe that the Babylonian method converges fast regardless of the initial guess, whereas Method X converges extremely slowly with initial guess 1.4 and diverges for initial guess 1.42. Hence, the Babylonian method is numerically stable, while Method X is numerically unstable.</p>

One of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/14263.xml">

round-off error</link>s arising from the use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../376/11376.xml">

Interpolation, extrapolation, and regression</st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../569/14569.xml">
Interpolation</link> solves the following problem: given the value of some unknown function at a number of points, what value does that function have at some other point between the given points? A very simple method is to use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/160010.xml">
linear interpolation</link>, which assumes that the unknown function is linear between every pair of successive points. This can be generalized to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../565/203565.xml">
polynomial interpolation</link>, which is sometimes more accurate but suffers from <mathematical_relation wordnetid="113783581" confidence="0.8">
<function wordnetid="113783816" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../763/202763.xml">
Runge's phenomenon</link></function>
</mathematical_relation>
. Other interpolation methods use localized functions like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../680/457680.xml">
spline</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../903/50903.xml">
wavelet</link>s.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/546415.xml">
Extrapolation</link> is very similar to interpolation, except that now we want to find the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/826997.xml">
Regression</link> is also similar, but it takes into account that the data is imprecise. Given some points, and a measurement of the value of some function at these points (with an error), we want to determine the unknown function. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/82359.xml">
least squares</link>-method is one popular way to achieve this.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Solving equations and systems of equations</st>

<p>

Another fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation. Two cases are commonly distinguished, depending on whether the equation is linear or not. For instance, the equation <math>2x+5=3</math> is linear while <math>2x^2+5=3</math> is not.</p>
<p>

Much effort has been put in the development of methods for solving <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../087/113087.xml">
systems of linear equations</link>. Standard direct methods, i.e., methods that use some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/253873.xml">

Optimization (mathematics)</link></it>
</indent>

Optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point also has to satisfy some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../360/206360.xml">
constraint</link>s.</p>
<p>

The field of optimization is further split in several subfields, depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint. For instance, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/43730.xml">
linear programming</link> deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear. A famous method in linear programming is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../458/349458.xml">
simplex method</link>.</p>
<p>

The method of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/159974.xml">

Numerical analysis is also concerned with computing (in an approximate way) the solution of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/1424309.xml">
differential equation</link>s, both ordinary differential equations and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../564/52564.xml">
partial differential equation</link>s.</p>
<p>

Partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing it into a finite-dimensional subspace. This can be done by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/18233581.xml">
finite element method</link>, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/39147.xml">
