<b>Ciphertext indistinguishability</b> is an important security property of many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/10294.xml">
encryption</link> schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt.  The property of indistinguishability under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/63852.xml">
chosen plaintext attack</link> is considered a basic requirement for most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../348/1182348.xml">
provably secure</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../222/24222.xml">
public key cryptosystem</link>s, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../586/103586.xml">
chosen ciphertext attack</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../533/426533.xml">
adaptive chosen ciphertext attack</link>.  Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../585/960585.xml">
semantic security</link>, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.</p>
<p>

A cryptosystem is considered <it>secure in terms of indistinguishability</it> if no adversary A, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (1/2).  If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than 1/2, then this adversary is considered to have an "advantage" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is <it>not</it> considered secure in terms of indistinguishability.  This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should glean no information from seeing a ciphertext.  Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.</p>

 Formal definitions</st>

<p>

Security in terms of indistinguishability has many definitions, depending on assumptions made about the capabilities of the attacker.  It is normally presented as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/18723138.xml">
game</link>, where the cryptosystem is considered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/562568.xml">
secure</link> if no adversary can win the game with significantly greater probability than an adversary who must guess randomly.  The most common definitions used in cryptography are <b>indistinguishability under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/63852.xml">
chosen plaintext attack</link></b> (abbreviated IND-CPA), <b>indistinguishability under (non-adaptive) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../586/103586.xml">
chosen ciphertext attack</link></b> (IND-CCA), and <b>indistinguishability under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../533/426533.xml">
adaptive chosen ciphertext attack</link></b> (IND-CCA2).  Security under either of the latter definition implies security under the previous ones: a scheme which is IND-CCA secure is also IND-CPA secure, and a scheme which is IND-CCA2 secure is both IND-CCA and IND-CPA secure.  Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of the these three definitions of security.</p>

<st>
Indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA)</st>

<p>

For a probabilistic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../222/24222.xml">
asymmetric key encryption algorithm</link>, indistinguishability under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/63852.xml">
chosen plaintext attack</link> (IND-CPA) is defined by the following game between an adversary and a challenger.  For schemes based on <link>
computational security</link>, the adversary is modeled by a <link>

</know-how>
</invention>
, meaning that it must complete the game and output a <it>guess</it> within a polynomial number of time steps.  In this definition E(PK, <it>M</it>) represents the encryption of a message <it>M</it> under the key <it>PK</it>:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The challenger generates a key pair <it>PK</it>, <it>SK</it> based on some security parameter <it>k</it> (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes <it>PK</it> to the adversary.  The challenger retains <it>SK</it>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The adversary may perform any number of encryptions or other operations.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Eventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts <math>M_0, M_1</math> to the challenger.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The challenger selects a bit <it>b</it> <math>\in</math> {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the <it>challenge</it> ciphertext <it>C</it> = E(PK, <math>M_b</math>) back to the adversary.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The adversary is free to perform any number of additional computations or encryptions.  Finally, it outputs a guess for the value of <it>b</it>.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

A cryptosystem is <b>indistinguishable under chosen plaintext</b> attack if every 
probabilistic polynomial time adversary has only a negligible "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../092/4636092.xml">
advantage</link>" over random 
guessing. An adversary is said to have a negligible "advantage" if it wins the above  
game with probability <math>(1/2) + \epsilon(k)</math>, where <math>\epsilon(k)</math> is a negligible function in the security parameter <it>k</it>, that is for every (nonzero) polynomial function <math>poly()</math> there exists <math>k_0</math> such that <math>|\epsilon(k)|&amp;lt;|1/poly(k)|</math> for all <math>k&amp;gt;k_0</math>.  </p>
<p>

Although the adversary knows <math>M_0</math>, <math>M_1</math> and PK, the probabilistic nature of E means that the encryption of <math>M_b</math> will be only one of many valid ciphertexts, and therefore encrypting <math>M_0</math>, <math>M_1</math> and comparing the resulting ciphertexts with the challenge ciphertext does not afford any advantage to the adversary.</p>
<p>

While the above definition is specific to an asymmetric key cryptosystem,  it can be adapted to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/53042.xml">
symmetric</link> case by replacing the public key encryption function with an "<link>
encryption oracle</link>", which retains the secret encryption key and encrypts arbitrary ciphertexts at the adversary's request.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack/adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA, IND-CCA2)</st>

<p>

Indistinguishability under non-adaptive and adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA, IND-CCA2) uses a definition similar to that of IND-CPA.  However, in addition to the public key (or encryption oracle, in the symmetric case), the adversary is given access to a "<link>
decryption oracle</link>" which decrypts arbitrary ciphertexts at the adversary's request, returning the plaintext.  In the non-adaptive definition, the adversary is allowed to query this oracle only up until it receives the challenge ciphertext.  In the adaptive definition, the adversary may continue to query the decryption oracle even after it has received a challenge ciphertext, with the caveat that it may not pass the challenge ciphertext for decryption (otherwise, the definition would be trivial).</p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<entry level="1" type="number">

 Equivalences and implications</st>

<p>

Indistinguishability is an important property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications.  However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties.  Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, it is known that the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/87027.xml">
non-malleability</link> under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2).  This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a property dealing with message integrity, rather than confidentiality.  In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa.  The following list summarizes a few known implications, though it is by no means complete.</p>
<p>

The notation <math>A \Rightarrow B</math> means that property A implies property B.  <math>A \Leftrightarrow B</math> means that properties A and B are <it>equivalent</it>.  <math>A \not \Rightarrow B</math> means that property A does not necessarily imply property B.</p>
