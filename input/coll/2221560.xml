Background</st>

<p>

By 1960, psychology had come to be dominated by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../801/540801.xml">
behaviorism</link> and learning theory, which emphasized the observable stimulus and response components of human and animal behavior while ignoring the cognitive processes that mediate the relationship between the stimulus and response. The cognitive phenomena occurring within the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/275901.xml">
black box</link>" between stimulus and response were of little interest to behaviorists, as their mathematical models worked without them. In 1960, the book <it>Plans and the Structure of Behavior</it>, authored by George A. Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram, was published. In this volume, Miller and his colleagues sought to unify the behaviorists' learning theory with a cognitive model of learned behavior. Whereas the behaviorists suggested that a simple <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../418/569418.xml">
reflex arc</link> underlies the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship, Miller and his colleagues proposed that "some mediating organization of experience is necessary" somewhere between the stimulus and response, in effect a cognitive process which must include monitoring devices that control the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship. They named this fundamental unit of behavior the T.O.T.E.</p>

The TOTE Unit in Human Cognition</st>
<p>

The self-control mechanisms in human tasking are explained in terms of both operations and monitoring processes.  Each recurring operation would be associated to a monitoring process, to test if the intended control was met or not. </p>
<p>

Its premise is that a common <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> for solving non-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/47922.xml">
deterministic</link> problems in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/37438.xml">
complex system</link>, is to <b>test</b> where the system is currently, then perform some <b>operation</b> that makes a change, then <b>retest</b> again, and to repeat this until the answer is satisfactory, at which point the process is complete and ends (or <b>exits</b>). </p>
<p>

The generic TOTE structure is:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<b>Test</b> to obtain some representation of the problem state</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<b>Operate</b> - intervene in some way</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<b>Test</b> again to see if the desired result has been achieved. If it has not, loop back to operate. If it has:</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<b>Exit</b> - problem solved</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

TOTEs are often <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/791347.xml">
nested</link> within other TOTEs, since as a means to meet a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../094/14850094.xml">
goal</link>, they are applicable to sub-goals too. </p>
<p>

TOTE units commonly used in many disciplines where iterative methods are applicable, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/9251.xml">
engineering</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/5904.xml">
cybernetics</link>. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/22921.xml">
psychology</link>, it is explicitly used as a key strategy within <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/67147.xml">
neuro-linguistic programming</link>.</p>
<p>

Central to the concept of the TOTE unit are the following principles:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../912/33912.xml">
Working memory</link> is limited to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../063/435063.xml">
7Â±2</link> chunks of information.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Planning, consisting of TOTE units, is essential in cognitive process. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Control of behavior exposes a set of chunks and TOTE units</entry>
</list>
</p>

Examples</st>
<p>

The following is an example of a simple TOTE:
When driving a car and looking for the appropriate turn off.
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Test</b> - is this the turnoff? - <b>No</b></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Operate</b> - keep driving</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Test</b> - is this the turnoff? - <b>No</b></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Operate</b> - keep driving</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Test</b> - is this the turnoff? - <b>Yes</b></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Exit</b></entry>
</list>

(this only finds the correct turnoff, and would be embedded in a larger TOTE)</p>
<p>

A TOTE can also be nested within other TOTEs, for example: 
Cooking a meal: 
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The top level TOTE for "testing if meal is cooked" is:</entry>
<entry level="2" type="indent">

Check meal -- leave a while -- recheck meal - take out of oven.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

As part of the "leave a while" part, there is a nested TOTE:</entry>
<entry level="2" type="indent">

Check 5 minutes is up -- wait a while -- recheck 5 minutes is up -- exit <it>(ie "leave a while" subgoal is achieved)''</it></entry>
</list>
