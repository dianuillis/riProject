The first version of MDAC was released in August 1996. At that time Microsoft stated MDAC was more a concept than a stand-alone program and had no widespread distribution method. Later Microsoft released upgrades to MDAC as web-based redistributable packages. Eventually, later versions were integrated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/18890.xml">
Microsoft Windows</link> and <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/15215.xml">
Internet Explorer</link></software>
, and in MDAC 2.8 SP1 they ceased offering MDAC as a redistributable package.</p>
<p>

Throughout its history MDAC has been the subject of several security flaws, which led to attacks such as an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/744621.xml">
escalated privileges attack</link>, although the vulnerabilities were generally fixed in later versions and fairly promptly. The current version is 2.8 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/473487.xml">
service pack</link> 1, but the product has had many different versions and many of its components have been deprecated and replaced by newer Microsoft technologies. MDAC is now known as Windows DAC in <version wordnetid="107173585" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The latest version of MDAC (2.8) consists of several interacting components, all of which are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/18890.xml">
Windows</link> specific except for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/168701.xml">
ODBC</link> (which is available on several platforms). MDAC architecture may be viewed as three layers: a programming interface layer, consisting of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/39155.xml">
ADO</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../840/1434840.xml">
ADO.NET</link>, a database access layer developed by database vendors such as Oracle and Microsoft (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/1435966.xml">
OLE DB</link>, .NET managed providers and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/168701.xml">

Microsoft SQL Server</link></software>
 Network Library, a proprietary access method specific to Microsoft SQL Server, is also included in the MDAC. Developers of Windows applications are encouraged to use ADO or ADO.NET for data access, the benefit being that users of the application program are not constrained in their choice of database architecture except that it should be supported by MDAC. Naturally, developers still have the choice of writing applications which directly access OLE DB and ODBC.</p>

 Microsoft SQL Server Network Library </st>
<p>

The Microsoft SQL Server Network Library (also known as Net-Lib) is used by the Microsoft SQL Server to read and write data using many different <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/630770.xml">
network protocol</link>s. Though Net-Lib is specific to the SQL Server, Microsoft includes it with MDAC. The SQL Server uses the Open Data Services (ODS) library to communicate with Net-Lib, which interfaces directly with the <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/33438.xml">
Windows NT</link></family>
 operating system line's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/81601.xml">
Win32</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../523/1942523.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22User+mode%22])">
subsystem</link>. The SQL Server Network Library is controlled through the use of a Client Network Utility, which is bundled with the SQL Server.</p>
<p>

Each Net-Lib supported network protocol has a separate driver (not to be confused with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/9101.xml">
device driver</link>), and has support for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/142409.xml">
session layer</link> in its protocol stack. There are two general types of Net-Lib: the primary and the secondary. The primary Net-Lib consists of a <it>Super Socket</it> Net-Lib and the <it>Shared Memory</it> Net-Lib, while there are numerous secondary Net-Libs, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../476/15476.xml">
TCP/IP</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../167/714167.xml">
named pipes</link> network libraries (named pipes are a method of communicating with other processes via a system-persistent <structure wordnetid="105726345" confidence="0.8">

 that is given an identity). The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) communicates via primary Net-Libs.</p>
<p>

The Super Socket Net-Lib deals with inter-computer communications and coordinates the secondary Net-Libs &mdash; though the TCP/IP secondary Net-Lib is an exception in that it calls on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/211226.xml">

RPC</link> Net-Libs were dropped from MDAC 2.5 onwards. The Network Library router had the job of managing all these protocols, however now only the named pipes secondary Net-Lib is managed by the router. The Super Socket Net-Lib also handles <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/18934432.xml">
data encryption</link> via the use of the Windows <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../813/187813.xml">
SSL</link> API.</p>
<p>

The Shared Memory Net-Lib, on the other hand, manages connections between multiple instances of SQL Server that exist on one computer. It uses a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/825653.xml">
shared memory</link> area to communicate between the processes. This is inherently secure; there is no need for data encryption between instances of SQL Server that exist on one computer as the operating system does not allow any other process access to the instances' area of shared memory.</p>
<p>

Net-Lib is also able to support the impersonation of a logged in user's security context for protocols that support authenticated connections (called <it>trusted connections</it>). This allows Net-Lib to provide an integrated logon authentication mechanism via the use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/596688.xml">
Windows Authentication</link>. Windows Authentication is not supported on Windows 98 or Windows Me.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

OLE DB</link> (also called OLEDB or OLE-DB) allows MDAC applications access to different types of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../040/18985040.xml">
data</link> stores in a uniform manner. Microsoft has used this technology to separate the application from the data store that it needs to access. This was done because different applications need access to different types and sources of data, and do not necessarily need to know how to access technology-specific functionality. The technology is conceptually divided into <it>consumers</it> and <it>providers</it>. The consumers are the applications that need access to the data, and the provider is the software component that exposes an OLE DB interface through the use of the <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

OLE DB is the database access interface technology used by MDAC. OLE DB providers can be created to access such simple data stores as a text file or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../686/27686.xml">
spreadsheet</link>, through to such complex databases as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../725/323725.xml">
Oracle</link> and <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../994/13989994.xml">
SQL Server</link></software>
. However, because different data store technology can have different capabilities, OLE DB providers may not implement every possible interface available. The capabilities that are available are implemented through the use of COM objects - an OLE DB provider will map the data store technology's functionality to a particular COM interface. Microsoft calls the availability of an interface to be "provider-specific" as it may not be applicable depending on the database technology involved. Additionally, however, providers may also augment the capabilities of a data store - these capabilities are known as <it>services</it> in Microsoft parlance.</p>
<p>

The <it>Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server</it> (SQLOLEDB) is the OLE DB provider that Microsoft provides for the <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../994/13989994.xml">
Microsoft SQL Server</link></software>
 from version 6.5 upwards. According to Microsoft, SQLOLEDB will be "the primary focus of future MDAC feature enhancements [and] will be available on the 64-bit Windows operating system."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

 Universal data link </st>
<p>
 
Universal data link files (or '.udl files') provide a common user interface for specifying connection attributes. A user can use a Data Link Properties <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/217500.xml">
dialog box</link> to save connection information in a .udl file as an alternative to directly specifying them by hand in a connection string. Consequently, these files provide a convenient level of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/166206.xml">
indirection</link>. Additionally, the dialog box specifies a number of alternate OLE DB data providers for a variety of target applications.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

 ODBC </st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/168701.xml">
Open Database Connectivity</link> (ODBC) is a native interface that is accessed through a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/23015.xml">
programming language</link> (usually <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

) that can make calls into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../421/106421.xml">
native library</link>. In MDAC this interface is defined as a DLL. A separate module or <link>
driver</link> is needed for each database that must be accessed. The functions in the ODBC API are implemented by these DBMS-specific drivers. The driver that Microsoft provides in MDAC is called the SQL Server ODBC Driver (SQLODBC), and (as the name implies) is designed for Microsoft's SQL Server. It supports SQL Server v6.5 and upwards.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> ODBC allows programs to use <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 ADO </st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/39155.xml">
ActiveX Data Objects</link> (<b>ADO</b>) is a high level programming interface to OLE DB. It uses a hierarchical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../757/22757.xml">
object</link> model to allow applications to programmatically <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../180/287180.xml">
create, retrieve, update and delete</link> data from sources supported by OLE DB. ADO consists of a series of hierarchical COM-based objects and collections, an object that acts as a container of many other objects. A programmer can directly access ADO objects to manipulate data, or can send an <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../004/29004.xml">

 query to the database via several ADO mechanisms. ADO is made up of nine objects and four <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../615/5170615.xml">
collections</link>.</p>
<p>

The collections are:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <b>Fields:</b> This collection contains a set of Field objects. The Collection can be used in either a Recordset object or in a Record object. In a Recordset object, each of the Field objects that make up the Fields collection corresponds to a column in that Recordset object. In a Record object, a Field can be an absolute or relative URL that points into a tree-structured namespace (used for semi-structured data providers like the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing) or as a reference to the default Stream object associated with that Record object.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <b>Properties:</b> An object can have more than one Property object, which are contained in the object's Properties collection.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <b>Parameters:</b> A Command object can have several Parameter commands to change its predefined behaviour, and each of the Parameter objects are contained in the Command object's Parameters collection<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <b>Errors:</b> All provider created errors are passed to a collection of Error objects, while the Errors collection itself is contained in a Connection object. When an ADO operation creates an error, the collection is cleared and a new group of Error objects are created in the collection.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The objects are:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <b>Connection:</b> The connection object is ADO's connection to a data store via OLE DB. The connection object stores information about the session and provides methods of connecting to the data store. As some data stores have different methods of establishing a connection, some methods may not be supported in the connection object for particular OLE DB providers. A connection object connects to the data store using its 'Open' method with a connection string which specifies the connection as a list of key value pairs (for example: "Provider='SQLOLEDB';Data Source='TheSqlServer'; Initial Catalog='Northwind';Integrated Security='SSPI';").<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> The start of which must identify the type of data store connection that the connection object requires.

 <b>Command:</b> After the connection object establishes a session to the data source, instructions are sent to the data provider via the command object. The command object can send SQL queries directly to the provider through the use of the <it>CommandText</it> property, send a parameterised query or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/277251.xml">
stored procedure</link> through the use of a <it>Parameter</it> object or <it>Parameters</it> collection or run a query and return the results to a dataset object via the <it>Execute</it> method. There are several other methods that can be used in the Command object relating to other objects, such as the Stream, RecordSet or Connection objects.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <b>Recordset:</b> A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/2666135.xml">
recordset</link> is a group of records, and can either come from a base table or as the result of a query to the table. The RecordSet object contains a <it>Fields</it> collection and a <it>Properties</it> collection.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> The Fields collection is a set of Field objects, which are the corresponding <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../167/1041167.xml">

 ADO.NET </st>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../840/1434840.xml">
ADO.NET</link> is the latest version of ADO (after ADO 2.8, now often referred to as ADO Classic) and is part of the MDAC 2.8 stack alongside classic ADO. It is built around <link>
Microsoft .NET</link>. Though sometimes seen as an evolutionary step up from ADO, some fundamental structural changes were made by Microsoft. ADO.NET runs through a .NET Managed Provider, a modified version of an OLE DB provider specifically designed for .NET. The object structure is no longer built around a Recordset object. Instead a Dataset object is used to contain data gathered from multiple sources. This is transparent to the programmer. Unlike the old ADO Recordset, the Dataset's design allows for disconnected data. Conceptually, a Dataset object can be seen as a small in-memory relational database in its own right that allows for manipulation of data in any direction (a Recordset was a forward-only reader). In order to propagate changes back into the database, a Dataadapter object is used that transfers data from between the data source and the DataSet object. <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

This version of MDAC had a security flaw that made it vulnerable to an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/744621.xml">
escalated privileges attack</link>. The vulnerability caused systems that had both IIS and MDAC installed to give an unauthorized web user the ability to execute shell commands on the IIS system as a privileged user. This allowed the attacker to use MDAC to tunnel SQL and other ODBC data requests through the public connection to a private back-end network when on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../227/641227.xml">
multi-homed</link> Internet-connected IIS system. It also allowed the user to gain unauthorized access to secured, non-published files on the IIS system<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref></p>

On May 23, 2005 Brad Rhodes (Lead Program Manager of Microsoft Data Access Technologies) announced that MDAC 2.8 SP1 was the last stand-alone redistributable of MDAC that Microsoft will ship. MDAC is now an official component of the Microsoft's operating system, though they will be providing ongoing bug and security fixes to previously released versions of the web-distributable version.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2260%22])">60</ref> However, Microsoft have created a new component called the <link>
SQL Native Client</link> (SQLNCLI), which is a stand alone data access API that has combined the OLE DB and ODBC libraries into one DLL. It was formed to be independent of MDAC, which is now reliant on the state the operating system is in &mdash; a developer now links to this library and avoids situations where an update of the operating system which updates MDAC breaks applications built to a different version of MDAC.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2261%22])">61</ref></p>

There are two ways of checking the version of MDAC that is installed on a computer. One way is via Microsoft's <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/7/8479c13c-aacd-4b79-bc1b-d64c683191a7/cc_pkg.exe">
Component Checker</weblink> program, which compares the value of each installed MDAC DLL to the MDAC file manifest. The second way is to check the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DataAccess\FullInstallVer in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/1164933.xml">
Windows registry</link>. Microsoft notes that this information may be incorrect for versions of MDAC prior to 2.1 when compared with the versions of the MDAC files installed to the system<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2263%22])">63</ref></p>
