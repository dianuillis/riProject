History</st>
<p>

World Financial Group was formed in 2001 from the select purchase of assets by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/2186512.xml">
AEGON</link> from the now defunct <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/2276934.xml">
World Marketing Alliance</link> (WMA). The former company was founded in 1991 by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/2506263.xml">
Hubert Humphrey</link>, who subsequently founded World Leadership Group.</p>

In 2007 WFG signed a two-year sponsorship agreement with Fox Sports Network and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/78455.xml">
Pacific Ten Conference</link> (Pac-10). The Pac-10 - known as the "Conference of Champions" - is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/669931.xml">

<p>

WFG's stated mission goal is to "serve the financial needs of individuals and families typically overlooked by the financial services industry".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> It is yet unclear how successfully the company has managed to distance itself from its more controversial predecessor, associated with fraud, misrepresentation and false statements, and the subject of class action lawsuits, and NASD disciplinary action.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> </p>
<p>

An April 2008 Bloomberg article also reports on recent accusations by securities regulators in Missouri, Utah, as well as others, aimed at WFG for "misrepresenting investment returns and making unsuitable sales of variable annuities". There have also been cases of private arbitrations "where variable annuities were allegedly sold to people too old to realize any benefit before they died" <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>. </p>
<p>

As well, the 'multigenerational',<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> and recursive associate-recruiting based compensation<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> business model that WFG follows in Canada places it firmly under classification as a "multi-level-marketing-plan" of business, as classified by the Canadian Competition Act, Section 55 and 55.1,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> and any company representative operating in Canada is subject to regulation under such classification. An annual and transition report filed for the parent corporation AEGON, with the SEC also classifies WFG as a "multi-level-marketing group of wealth management advisor networks".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> </p>
<p>

Further, "Establishing a tradition that lives on at World Financial, Humphrey (the founder) staged lavish conventions and handed out an assortment of diamond-studded rings and other luxuries to motivate the troops.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
