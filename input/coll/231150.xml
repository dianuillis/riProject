Gameplay and rules</st>
<p>

The game is played using:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

a <it>decoding board</it>, with a <it>shield</it> at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>code pegs</it> of six different colors, with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>key pegs</it>, some colored (often black), some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the small holes on the board.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/143135.xml">
even number</link>. One player becomes the <it>codemaker</it>, the other the <it>codebreaker</it>. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. Duplicates are allowed, so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color. The chosen pattern is placed in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker.</p>
<p>

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten (sometimes eight or twelve) turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored (often black) key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white peg indicates the existence of a correct color peg placed in the wrong position (to be precise, the number of white pegs is the extra number of black pegs that it is possible to get using exactly the code pegs in that guess.)</p>
<p>

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or ten incorrect guesses are made.</p>
<p>

The codemaker gets one point for each guess a codebreaker makes. The colored key pegs are what give you your score, so if you have 5 colored key pegs on the game board, your score is 5. An extra point is earned by the codemaker if the codebreaker doesn't guess the pattern exactly in the last guess. The winner is the one who has the most points after the agreed-upon number of games are played.
Originally there were two scoring methods to choose from: codebreaker's score and codemaker's score (see for instance <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://boardgamegeek.com/image/127838?size=original">
boardgamegeek.com</weblink>). (i)&nbsp;Codebreaker's score: the codebreaker gets one point for each row of guesses. The winner is the player with the least number of points after the agreed-upon number of games are played. (ii)&nbsp;Codemaker's score: The codemaker gets one point for each row of pegs not showing the correct code placed by the codebreaker. The winner is the player with the most number of points after the agreed-upon number of games are played. Later this rule was added: If the codebreaker can show that the codemaker has given wrong information, the game is replayed and the codebreaker gets three additional points.</p>

. (Invicta always named the game <b>Master&nbsp;Mind</b>.) They originally manufactured it themselves, though they have since licensed its manufacture to <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../233/67233.xml">

 in most of the world, and two other manufacturers who have the United States and Israel manufacturing rights.</p>
<p>

Starting in 1973, the game box featured a photograph of a well-dressed, distinguished-looking white man seated in the foreground, with an attractive Asian woman standing behind him. The connection between these people and the game of Mastermind was not explained.  The two models (Bill Woodward and Cecilia Fung) reunited in June 2003 to pose for another publicity photo.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Algorithms</st>

<p>

With 4 pegs and 6 colours, there are 64 = 1296 different patterns.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Six guess algorithm</st>

<p>

The following algorithm solves the game in 6 or fewer guesses. It has a general procedure and a few listed exceptions. In this section the six colours are referred to as letters <b>a</b> through <b>f</b>.</p>
<p>

Divide the 1296 possible games into 4 categories:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 0 duplicates    (eg abcd)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 1 duplicate     (eg aabc)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 2 duplicates    (eg aabb or aaab)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 3 duplicates    (eg aaaa)</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The general process is to list all the games that could be correct with the data so far. The list should be sorted by ascending number of duplicates and within each duplicate level alphabetically.  Before guess 1, the list is all 1296 games; thus guess 1 is always "abcd."  If the reply to guess 1 is "0 0," for example, then the list afterwards comprises the 16 games involving only e and f.  Each subsequent guess is the first game remaining in the list, with the following exceptions:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Guess 2 is always "bcde"</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Guess 3 is always "cdef"</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 If the list for guess 4 starts with a game on the left side of the list below, then use the game to its right instead:</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "acfb" → "dcad"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "aebf" → "edfd"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "aefb" → "eacc"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "afbe" → "bfcd"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "bafe" → "eadc"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "beaf" → "edae"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "befa" → "eeda"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "eabf" → "fdfb"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "aadb" → "babd"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "abae" → "bbcc"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "aeaf" → "cffd"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "cafa" → "fdfa"</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 "aaee" → "dddf"</entry>

Five guess algorithm</st>

<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../549/34549.xml">

</person>
 demonstrated that the codebreaker can solve the pattern in five moves or fewer, using an algorithm that progressively reduced the number of possible patterns.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>
The algorithm works as follows:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The first guess is aabb.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Calculate which possibilities (from the 1296) would give the same score of colored and white pegs if they were the answer. Remove all the others.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

For each possible guess (not necessarily one of the remaining possibilities) and for each possible colored/white score, calculate how many possibilities would be eliminated. The score of the guess is the least of such values. Play the guess with the highest score (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/19589.xml">
minimax</link>).</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Go back to step 2 until you have got it right.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<b>while</b> coloredScore != 0
<b>if</b> numberOfTries == 0
guess("aabb")
<b>else</b>
maximumGuess = ""
maximumGuessScore = 0
<b>foreach</b> possibleGuess
thisScore = 9999
<b>foreach</b> possibleScore
number_of_removals = count_removals(guess, score)
thisScore = <b>min</b>(number_of_removals, thisScore)
if thisScore &amp;gt; maximumGuessScore
maximumGuessScore = thisScore
maximumGuess = guess
guess(maximumGuess)</p>
<p>

Subsequent mathematicians have been finding various algorithms that reduce the average number of turns needed to solve the pattern: in 1993, <link>
Kenji Koyama</link> and <link>
Tony W. Lai</link> found a method that required an average of 4.340 turns to solve, with a worst case scenario of six turns.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

Variations</st>


<p>

Varying the number of colors and the number of peg positions results in a spectrum of Mastermind games of different sizes and shapes. A common variation is with 8 different colors, which can also be played as 9 different colors using an empty slot as the ninth "color". </p>
<p>

The moves required when the number of colors varies was studied in <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.tnelson.demon.co.uk/mastermind/">
http://www.tnelson.demon.co.uk/mastermind/</weblink>.</p>
<p>

In December <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/35984.xml">
2005</link>, <link>
Jeff Stuckman</link> and <link>
Guo-Qiang Zhang</link> showed in an <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0512049">

<p>

Exactly the same game is also sold with other names, at least
"Secret Code" by the Danish company Top-Toy As, 
possibly to circumvent the trademark of the original name.</p>
