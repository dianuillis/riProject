<b>Sula Benet</b> (also known as <b>Sara Benetowa</b>; 1903&mdash;1982) was a <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 anthropologist of the 20th century who studied Polish and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../624/15624.xml">
Judaic</link> customs and traditions.  <p>

Born in Poland, <b>Benet</b> was fascinated with peasant culture of Poland since her early youth.  This interest eventually led her to enroll as a student of literature and philosophy in the Faculty of Humanities in the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../563/11157563.xml">
University of Warsaw</link></university>
 but graduated with a degree in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../569/569.xml">
anthropology</link>. Upon receiving her degree in 1935, she attended graduate school at <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, where she received her <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/188886.xml">
doctorate</link> in 1944.</p>
<p>

Benet's writings have gained modern notability for her interpretations of the herb known as <it>kaneh-bosm</it> or <it>kneh-bosm</it> mentioned in the <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

 and how it may relate to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../004/2331004.xml">

 as part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/1962530.xml">
holy anointing oil</link> used in the temple and has historically been interpreted as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/371540.xml">
calamus</link>.  Through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/888207.xml">
comparative etymology</link> and analysis of ancient texts, <b>Benet</b> asserts that the word <it>kaneh-bosm</it> actually refers to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../310/38310.xml">
cannabis</link> and was used in ancient <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../913/15913.xml">
Jewish</link> religious rites, possible as an intoxicant.  Pro-cannabis advocates cite <b>Benet</b>'s work as an example that cannabis use has a long culturally important history, and that the criminalization and demonization of cannabis is a recent invention.  While Benet's conclusion regarding the psychoactive use of cannabis is not universally accepted among <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../913/15913.xml">
Jewish</link> scholars, there is general agreement that cannabis is used in talmudic sources to refer to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/963313.xml">
hemp</link> fibers, as hemp was a vital commodity before linen replaced it. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

According to Benet's research, cannabis appears in ancient Hebrew texts spelled with the Hebrew letters: “Kuph, Nun, Hé ­ Bet, Shin, Mem,” translated into western alphabetic forms as ¹aneh-bosm, kaneh-bosm or kineboisin. The book of Exodus records the event of Moses receiving the instructions for making and distributing the hemp enriched holy oil, in the most auspicious tones.</p>
<p>

Then the Lord said to Moses, "Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of <link>
qaneh-bosm</link>, 500 shekels of cassia--all according to the sanctuary shekel--and a hind of olive oil. Make these into a sacred anointing oil” (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../662/9662.xml">
Exodus</link> 30: 22-33).
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

<p>

However, the words 'Kaneh bosm' are not in the KJV or the new international version of the bible. It is popular belief that Exodus chapter 30, verse 22 talks about using the oil of 'Kaneh bosm' or 'Kannabos', but this myth can easily be dispelled by simply opening a bible and looking. 
Furthermore, the text in Exodus does mention the following herbs/oils: myrrh, frangrant cinnamon, fragrant cane, cassia and olive oil. None of these translates to Kaneh, Kaneb, Kannabus, Kannabos. I encourage everyone to seek their on truth here, do the research yourself and see what you find. </p>
