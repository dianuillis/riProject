<b>Chicken Marengo</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../620/3735620.xml">
Italian savoury dish</link>, so named for being the dish that <link>
Napoléon Bonaparte</link> ate after the <conflict wordnetid="100958896" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../671/157671.xml">
Battle of Marengo</link></conflict>
.<p>

According to tradition Napoleon demanded a quick meal after the battle and his chef was forced to work with the meager results of a forage: a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/5741239.xml">
chicken</link> (and some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/19196010.xml">
eggs</link>), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/9940234.xml">
tomato</link>es, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/51258.xml">
onions</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/50469.xml">
garlic</link>, herbs, olive oil, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../600/43600.xml">
crayfish</link>. The chef cut up the chicken (reportedly with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/75971.xml">
sabre</link>) and fried it in olive oil, made a sauce from the tomatoes, garlic and onions (plus a bit of cognac from Napoleon's flask), cooked the crayfish, fried the eggs and served them as a garnish, with some of the soldier's bread ration on the side.  Napoleon reportedly liked the dish and (having won the battle) considered it lucky.  He refused to have the ingredients altered on future occasions even when his chef tried to omit the crayfish.  </p>

Modern versions of the dish are made by first flouring then browning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/37402.xml">
chicken</link> portions in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
oil</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/46183.xml">
butter</link>.  The part-cooked chicken is then transferred into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/30916.xml">
tomato sauce</link> (usually made with onions, garlic, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/32961.xml">
wine</link> &amp; chopped tomatoes). The whole is then cooked slowly until the chicken is done, and a few minutes before serving, a good amount of chopped <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../296/13296.xml">
herbs</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
black olives</link> are added. This would usually be eaten with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/23501.xml">
potato</link> dish of some sort, or just <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../969/36969.xml">
crusty bread</link>.</p>

According to tradition, Napoléon's chef was simply using the ingredients he had in hand. In reality, olive trees did not grow in the then-relatively cold climate of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../061/25061.xml">
Piedmont</link>, where the city of <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

It seems, that the people from Pakistan, did some modifications (i.e. green chilli) to the dish and named it Karahi Gosht, which is a very famous dish between Pakistani people and Indian people.</p>
