. After joining Aramco in 1947 and climbing the managerial ladder, in 1969 he became Supervisor in Abqaiq Production Department. He was then promoted to Assistant Director, then Director of Production in the Northern Province in 1972. He then became Vice-President of Production Affairs in 1975, then Vice-President of Petroleum Affairs in 1978. Al Naimi was elected Member of Board of Directors in 1980 and was promoted to the newly created position of Executive Vice-President of Oil and Gas Affairs in 1981 overseeing all of Saudi Aramco's core business. He was named President of Saudi Aramco in 1983 and was the first Saudi to hold that position. Later, after combining the presidency and chief executive position, he was named President and Chief Executive Officer. He became the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources in 1995 and still holds that position.<p>
