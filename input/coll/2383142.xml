. The school district boundaries are synonymous with the city of Harrisburg.<p>

Harrisburg public schools provide education for the city's youth, beginning with preschool through twelfth grade. There are over 11,000 students in the district and roughly 1,200 faculty and staff.  A multi-year restructuring and reform plan is aimed at making the district a model urban educational system.</p>
<p>

In July <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/34548.xml">
2000</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/809976.xml">
Pennsylvania Supreme Court</link> issued a ruling that upholds the law adopted by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/1952299.xml">
Pennsylvania General Assembly</link>, and signed by then Governor <officeholder wordnetid="110371450" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../384/211384.xml">

, that permitted a change in the governance of the Harrisburg School District from an elected school board, to a board of control named by Harrisburg mayor <politician wordnetid="110451263" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../723/1193723.xml">

, and which gave the mayor direct oversight of the troubled district. It was the first time a mayor had taken on the role in the state. Since then, graduation rates are up 71 per-cent and the number of students continuing to higher education are up 263 per-cent.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

In 2006 Harrisburg High School was in Corrective Action 2 (third year) for No Child Left Behind. Eleventh graders' PSSA Reading scores were 33.2% achieving proficient or better.  Eleventh grade Mathematics scores were 18.9% proficient or better. The graduation rate in 2006 was 62.9%, a decline from 74.51% in 2005.</p>
<p>

In 2007, Pittsburgh Business Times ranked the district 498th out of 498 Pennsylvania school districts based on three years of Pennsylvania System of Student Assessment test scores. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> District Superintendent Gerald Kohn rebuted the ranking saying the district is showing improvement since 2002.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Harrisburg district had 15.5 percent of students scoring advanced or proficient in reading and math on the state tests in March 2002. By March, 2006, the district had increased that number to 23.6 percent<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> -- a 52.3 percent improvement that landed the district at 25 in its own ranking system.</p>
<p>

For the 2006-2007 school year, the district received a $13.5 million grant to support its all-grade alternative school at the William Penn building, a program credited with improving discipline and performance across the district.</p>
<p>

Mayor Stephen R. Reed has been in charge of the district since a takeover approved by the state in 2000.</p>
<p>

Pennsylvania State University conducted a phone survey of 6th grade parents in 2003. Questions focused on parent awareness of services available to students. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cas.la.psu.edu/research/maternal/documents/harrisburg_district_report.pdf">
