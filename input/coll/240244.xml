<b>Biological interactions</b> result from the fact that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/19653842.xml">
organism</link>s in an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/9632.xml">
ecosystem</link> interact with each other, in the natural world, no organism is an autonomous entity isolated from its surroundings. It is part of its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/558685.xml">
environment</link>, rich in living and non living elements all of which interact with each other in some fashion. An organism's interactions with its environment are fundamental to the survival of that organism and the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole. Sign-mediated interactions in which molecules serve as signs are the characteristic feature of communicative interactions. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../630/9630.xml">
ecology</link>, biological interactions are the relationships between two species in an ecosystem. These relationships can be categorized into many different classes of interactions based either on the effects or on the mechanism of the interaction.  The interactions between two species vary greatly in these aspects as well as in duration and strength.  Species may meet once in  a generation (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/233609.xml">
pollination</link>) or live completely within another (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/9677.xml">
endosymbiosis</link>).  Effects may range from one species eating the other (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/57559.xml">
predation</link>), to mutual benefit (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/51483.xml">
mutualism</link>).  </p>
<p>

The interactions between two species need not be through direct contact.  Due to the connected nature of ecosystems, species may affect each other through intermediaries such as shared resources or common enemies.</p>

Terms which explicitly indicate the quality of benefit or harm in terms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../849/187849.xml">
fitness</link> experienced by participants in an interaction are listed below. There are six possible combinations, ranging from mutually beneficial through neutral to mutually harmful interactions. The level of benefit or harm is continuous and not discrete, such that an interaction may be trivially harmful through to deadly, for example. It is important to note that these interactions are not always static.  In many cases, two species will interact differently under different conditions.  This is particularly true in, but not limited to, cases where species have multiple, drastically different life stages.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Neutralism</st>

<p>

<b>Neutralism</b> describes the relationship between two species which do interact but do not affect each other. It is to describe interactions where the fitness of one species has absolutely no effect whatsoever on that of other. True neutralism is extremely unlikely and impossible to prove.  When dealing with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/37438.xml">
complex networks</link> of interactions presented by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/9632.xml">
ecosystems</link>, one cannot assert positively that there is absolutely no competition between or benefit to either species.Since true neutralism is rare or nonexistent, its usage is often extended to situations where interactions are merely insignificant or negligible.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Amensalism</st>
<p>

Amensalism  between two species involves one impeding or restricting the success of the other without being affected positively or negatively by the presence of the other.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> It is a type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/39626.xml">
symbiosis</link>. Usually this occurs when one <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/19653842.xml">
organism</link> exudes a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/144412.xml">
chemical compound</link> as part of its normal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../374/20374.xml">
metabolism</link> that is detrimental to another organism.</p>
<p>

The bread mold <fungus wordnetid="112992868" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/162264.xml">
Penicillium</link></fungus>
 is a common example of this; penicillium secrete <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/23312.xml">
penicillin</link>, a chemical that kills bacteria. A second example is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../575/1115575.xml">
black walnut</link> tree (<it>Juglans nigra</it>), which secrete <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/3118602.xml">
juglone</link>, a chemical that harms or kills some species of neighboring plants, from its roots. This interaction may still increase the fitness of the non-harmed organism though, by removing competition and allowing it access to greater scarce resources. In this sense the impeding organism can be said to be negatively affected by the other's very existence, making it a +/- interaction.</p>
<p>

Antibiosis or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../030/632030.xml">

Competition is an interaction  between individuals or populations that is mutually detrimental.</p>
<p>

Synnecrosis is a particular case in which the interaction is so mutually detrimental that it results in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../221/8221.xml">
death</link>, as in the case of some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/43937.xml">

</indent>
In antagonistic interactions one species benefits at the expense of another. Predation is an interaction between organisms in which one organism captures <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/7906908.xml">
biomass</link> from another.  It is often used as a synonym for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/6543.xml">
 carnivory</link> but in its widest definition includes all forms of one organism eating another, regardless of trophic level (e.g. herbivory), closeness of association (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/43937.xml">
parasitism</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/217438.xml">
parasitoid</link>ism) and harm done to prey (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../453/854453.xml">
grazing</link>). Other interactions that cannot be classed as predation however are still possible, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../462/865462.xml">
Batesian mimicry</link>, where an organism bears a superficial similarity of at least one sort, such as a harmless plant coming to mimic a poisonous one.</p>

The following two interactions can be classed as facilitative. Facilitation describes species interactions that benefit at least one of the participants and cause no harm to either.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Facilitations can be categorized as mutualisms, in which both species benefit, or commensalisms, in which one species benefits and the other is unaffected. Much of classic ecological theory (e.g., natural selection, niche separation, metapopulation dynamics) has focused on negative interactions such as predation and competition, but positive interactions (facilitation) are receiving increasing focus in ecological research.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>

Commensalism</link></it>
</indent>
Commensalism benefits one organism and the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed. It occurs when one organism takes benefits by interacting with another organism by which the host orgaism is not affected. A good example is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../199/200199.xml">
remora</link> living with a shark. Remoras eat leftover food from the shark. The shark is not affected in the process as remoras eat only leftover food of the shark which doesn't deplete the sharks resources.</p>

Mutualism is an interaction between two or more species, where species derive a mutual benefit, for example an increased <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/47544.xml">
carrying capacity</link>. Similar interactions within a species are known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../105/4839105.xml">
co-operation</link>. Mutualism may be classified in terms of the closeness of association, the closest being symbiosis, which is often confused with mutualism. One or both species involved in the interaction may be , meaning they cannot survive in the short or long term without the other species. Though mutualism has historically received less attention than other interactions such as predation,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> it is very important subject in ecology. Examples include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../683/11267683.xml">

The term symbiosis (<language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

: living together) can be used to describe various degrees of close relationship between organisms of different species.  Sometimes it is used only for cases where both organisms benefit, sometimes it is used more generally to describe all varieties of relatively tight relationships, i.e. even parasitism, but not predation.  Some even go so far as to use it to describe predation. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>.  It can be used to describe relationships where one organism lives on or in another, or it can be used to describe cases where organisms are related by mutual stereotypic behaviors.</p>
<p>

In either case symbiosis is much more common in the living world and much more important than is generally assumed.  Almost every organism has many internal parasites.  A large percentage of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/44568.xml">
herbivores</link> have mutualistic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../637/3135637.xml">

Coral</link> reefs are the result of mutalisms between coral organisms and various types of algae that live inside them.  Most land plants and thus, one might say, the very existence of land ecosystems rely on mutualisms between the plants which <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/719534.xml">
