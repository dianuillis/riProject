. This control can be accomplished in many ways and for many reasons; however traffic shaping is always achieved by delaying packets.  Traffic shaping is commonly applied at the network edges to control traffic entering the network, but can also be applied by the traffic source (for example, computer or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/243613.xml">

Nodes in an IP network which buffer packets before sending on a link which is at capacity result in a traffic shaping effect.  This can appear at for example a low bandwidth link (such as dial-up), a particularly expensive WAN link or satellite hop.</p>

 Implementation </st>
<p>

A traffic shaper works by delaying metered traffic such that each packet complies with the relevant <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../426/1585426.xml">
traffic contract</link>.  Metering may be implemented with for example the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/1056496.xml">
leaky bucket</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/1107299.xml">

).  Metered packets or cells are then stored in a <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

buffer</link> for each separately shaped class, until they can be transmitted in compliance with the prevailing traffic contract.  This may occur immediately (if the traffic arriving at the shaper is already compliant), after some delay (waiting in the buffer until its scheduled release time) or never (in case of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/4373.xml">
buffer overflow</link>).</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Overflow Condition</st>
<p>

All traffic shaper implementations have a finite buffer, and must cope with the case where the buffer is full.  A simple and common approach is to drop traffic arriving while the buffer is full (tail drop), thus resulting in <it>traffic policing</it> as well as shaping.  A more sophisticated implementation could apply a dropping algorithm such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../827/1112827.xml">
Random Early Discard</link>; a crude alternative would be to allow overflowing traffic through unshaped.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Traffic Classification</st>
<p>

Simple traffic shaping schemes shape all traffic uniformly by rate. More sophisticated shapers first <it>classify</it> traffic.  <it>Traffic classification</it> categorises traffic (for example, based on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/347136.xml">
port number</link> or <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">
<protocol wordnetid="106665108" confidence="0.8">

<rule wordnetid="106652242" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/630770.xml">
protocol</link></rule>
</direction>
</protocol>
</message>
). Each resulting traffic class can be treated differently to differentiate the service implied for the user (data generator/ consumer).  For example, each traffic class could be subject to a different rate limit, shaped separately and/or prioritized relative to other traffic classes.  This differentiation can be used by a network operator to treat different types of application traffic differently (for example, prioritize voice over file sharing for the responsiveness perceived by end users), and to offer premium services at a higher price point than basic ones<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.</p>
<p>

Classification is achieved by various means.  Matching bit patterns of data to those of known protocols is a simple, yet widely-used technique. An example to match the <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

ingress point</link> (the point at which traffic enters the network) with a granularity that allows the traffic-shaping control mechanism to separate traffic into individual flows and shape them differently <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>

<p>

A <it>self-limiting source</it> produces traffic which never exceeds some upper bound, for example media sources which cannot transmit faster than their encoded rate allows.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Self-limiting sources shape the traffic they generate to a greater or lesser degree.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../196/6008196.xml">

</indent>
Traffic shaping is of interest especially to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
Internet Service Providers</link> (ISPs). Their high-cost, high-traffic networks are their major assets, and as such, are the focus of all their attentions. They often use traffic shaping as a method to optimize the use of their network, sometimes by intelligently shaping traffic according to importance, other times by discouraging uses of applications by harsh means.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> There are those who believe it is not the ISPs place to decide what is "important"; in such cases per-client traffic shaping is more effective without creating potential controversies about what traffic is being controlled.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Benefits</st>
<p>

To ISPs, mere protocol identification (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Traffic+Classification%22])">
classification</link>) gives the intangible yet significant benefit of seeing what internet traffic is flowing through the network. From this they can see which subscribers are doing what on their network and can target services to the subscriber base they have attracted. However as time progresses, more and more protocols are using tunneling and encryption to defeat these methods. Also, many protocols are very difficult or impossible to detect. In such cases, per-client shaping is more effective. By establishing policies based on the IP or IP grouping of a client, end users cannot defeat shaping by disguising protocols or encrypting their traffic.</p>
<p>

In addition, intelligent shaping schemes can guarantee a particular Quality of Service (often measured in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../118/14865118.xml">
jitter</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../109/2928109.xml">

) for an application or a user while still allowing other traffic to use all remaining bandwidth. This allows ISPs to offer <standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">

</standard>
 and to upsell existing services to subscribers (such as offering minimum-latency computer gaming for an additional fee on top of basic internet). </p>
<p>

More importantly, shaping allows ISPs to tier their services using software, reducing their costs and increasing the menu of products they can offer.</p>

<it>For the debate about ISPs degrading performance of some kinds of Internet traffic, see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../166/1398166.xml">
network neutrality</link>.</it>
</indent>
Networks operators often distinguish between different types of traffic.  Each type of traffic is called a <it>class</it>, and the process of determining which class a packet falls into is <it>classification</it>.  </p>
<p>

Operators often distinguish three broad types of network traffic: Sensitive, Best-Effort, and Undesired.</p>

<ss2>
<st>
Sensitive Traffic</st>
<p>

Sensitive traffic is traffic the operator has an expectation to deliver on time. This includes VoIP, online gaming, video conferencing, and web browsing. Shaping schemes are generally tailored in such a way that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/25315.xml">
quality of service</link> of these selected uses is guaranteed, or at least prioritized over other classes of traffic. This can be accomplished by the absence of shaping for this traffic class, or by prioritizing sensitive traffic above other classes.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Best-Effort Traffic</st>
<p>

Best effort traffic is all other kinds of non-detrimental traffic. This is traffic that the ISP deems isn't sensitive to Quality of Service metrics (jitter, packet loss, latency). A typical example would be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../107/24107.xml">
peer-to-peer</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">
email</link> applications<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>.  Traffic management schemes are generally tailored so best-effort traffic gets the what is left after sensitive traffic.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Undesired Traffic</st>
<p>

This category is generally limited to the delivery of spam and traffic created by worms, botnets, and other malicious attacks. In some networks, this definition can include such traffic as non-local VoIP (for example, <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/424589.xml">
Skype</link></software>
) or video streaming services to protect the market for the 'in-house' services of the same type. In these cases, traffic management schemes identify and block this traffic entirely, or severely hampering its operation. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 engages in traffic shaping and policing peer-to-peer traffic. Some allege this activity to be in violation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/5985.xml">
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</link> (CRTC) regulations.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

<st>
File Sharing</st>

<p>

Peer-to-peer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../797/18949797.xml">
File Sharing</link> applications are often designed to use any and all available bandwidth which impacts <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/25315.xml">
QoS</link>-sensitive applications (like <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

</event>
) that use comparatively small amounts of bandwidth. P2P programs can also suffer from download strategy inefficiencies, namely downloading files from any available peer, regardless of link cost. However, the biggest problem with P2P is not the downloads themselves; it is typically the discovery process. The applications use ICMP and regular HTTP traffic to discover servers and download directories of available files.</p>
<p>

Recent figures show that the usage of one-fifth of the highest-usage subscribers must be added together to make up only close to 80% of P2P traffic on ISP networks. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/1641481.xml">
Sandvine Incorporated</link></company>
 has determined, through traffic analysis, that P2P traffic accounts for up to 60% of traffic on most networks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> This shows, in contrast to previous studies and forecasts, that P2P has become more mainstream than a handful of P2P users on the network.</p>
<p>

If P2P is being used by more than the top fifth of an ISP's subscriber base, a harsh anti-P2P policy may have disastrous consequences on subscriber numbers, increasing the subscriber <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/2371147.xml">
churn rate</link>. In some extreme cases (like that of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../874/372874.xml">
Rogers Communications</link></company>
) this may damage the ISPs reputation permanently.</p>
<p>

P2P protocols are designed specifically to avoid being classified as such, and with enough robustness that they do not depend on specific <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/25315.xml">
QoS</link> properties in the network (in-order packet delivery, jitter, etc. - typically this is achieved through increased buffering and reliable transport, with the user experiencing increased the download time as a result).  File sharing traffic can be appropriately classified as Best-Effort traffic. At peak times when sensitive traffic is at its height, download speeds will decrease. However, since P2P downloads are often background activities, it affects the subscriber experience little, so long as the download speeds increase to their full potential when all other subscribers hang up their VoIP phones. Exceptions are real-time P2P VoIP and P2P video streaming services who need permanent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/25315.xml">
QoS</link> and use excessive overhead and parity traffic to enforce this as far as possible. </p>
<p>

Many P2P applications can be configured to act as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Self-limiting_sources%22])">
self-limiting sources</link>, serving as a traffic shaper configured to the user's (as opposed to the network operator's) traffic specification.</p>
<p>

Some vendors advocate managing clients rather than specific protocols, particularly for ISPs. By managing per-client (that is, per customer),  if the client chooses to use their fair share of the bandwidth running P2P applications, they can do so,  but if their application is abusive, they only clog their own bandwidth and cannot affect the bandwidth used by other customers.</p>

Traffic Shaping and Prioritization is becoming more and more common in the corporate market. Most companies with remote offices are now connected via a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/38140.xml">
WAN</link> (Wide Area Network).  Applications tend to become centrally hosted at the head office and remote offices are expected to pull data from central databases and server farms.  As applications become more hungry in terms of bandwidth and prices of dedicated circuits being relatively high in most areas of the world, instead of increasing the size of their WAN circuits, companies feel the need to properly manage their circuits to make sure business-oriented traffic gets priority over best-effort traffic.  Traffic shaping is thus a good means for companies to avoid purchasing additional bandwidth while properly managing these resources.</p>

Other upcoming technologies to this regards are Application Acceleration and WAN Optimization and Compression which are fundamentally different from Traffic Shaping. Traffic Shaping defines bandwidth rules (or [https://packeteer.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/packeteer.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=60&amp;p_created=984707874&amp;p_sid=-nyQb5Ai&amp;p_accessibility=0&amp;p_redirect=&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PWRmbHQmcF9ncmlkc29ydD0mcF9yb3dfY250PTEzNSZwX3Byb2RzPTAmcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX2ZubCZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PXBhcnRpdGlvbg**&amp;p_li=&amp;p_topview=1 partitions] as some vendors call them) whereas Application Acceleration using multiple techniques like TCP <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../809/5302809.xml">
Performance Enhancing Proxy</link>. WAN Optimization and Compression (WOC) on the other hand would use compression and differential algorithms and techniques to compress data streams or send only differences in file updates. The latter is quite effective for chatty protocols like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/349873.xml">
CIFS</link>.</p>
