A <b>System Context Diagram</b> (<b>SCD</b>) is the highest level view of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/8286675.xml">
system</link>, similar to Block Diagram, showing a, possibly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../456/10768456.xml">
software</link>-based, system as a whole and its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../264/41264.xml">
input</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../470/41470.xml">
output</link>s from/to external factors. <p>

System context diagram are a type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1344164.xml">
Data Flow Diagram</link>, and show the interactions between a system and other actors with which the system is designed to face. SCD is very helpful in understanding the context in which the system will be part of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/27010.xml">
software engineering</link>. Context diagrams are typically drawn using labeled boxes to represent each of the external entities and another labeled box to represent the system being developed.  The relationship is drawn as a line between the entities and the system being developed.  The relationships are labeled with a subject-verb-object format. For example, "customer places order."  Context diagrams can also use many different drawing types to represent external entities.  They can use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/2027249.xml">
oval</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../802/974802.xml">
stick figure</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../925/71925.xml">
picture</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../557/840557.xml">
clip art</link> or any other representation to convey meaning.  Decision trees and data storage are represented in system flow diagrams.</p>
<p>

Context diagrams are used early in a project to get agreement on the scope under investigation.  Context diagrams are typically included in a requirements document.  These diagrams must be read by all project stakeholders and thus should be written in plain language, so the stakeholders can understand items within the document.  </p>
<p>

An alternative would be a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/4495923.xml">
use case diagram</link> since it also represents the scope of the project at a similar level of abstraction.</p>
<p>

The best System Context Diagrams are used to display how system inter operates at a very high level or how systems operate and interact logically. The system context diagram is a necessary tool in developing a baseline interaction between systems and actors; actors and system or systems and systems.</p>
