In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../753/34753.xml">
1978</link>, Velasquez decided to adopt a new organizing strategy. The union believed that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. So that year 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Six years later, not much had changed even though FLOC had conducted a well-publicized 560-mile march from Toledo to Campbell Soup headquarters in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Continuing pressure</st>
<p>

FLOC continued to address issues related to its collective bargaining agreement in the late 1980s. Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate. Campbell's purchased only a portion of their product, but the higher costs of wages and benefits affected their entire crop. Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm worker unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican wages and benefits closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
<p>

FLOC also fought back against subtle state-sponsored pressure. The union successfully sued the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/8826547.xml">
Ohio Highway Patrol</link> (OHP) in September <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../636/34636.xml">
1996</link> for stopping Hispanic migrant workers without justification and, in some cases, confiscating green cards. In December <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/34601.xml">
1997</link>, a federal district court judge issued a preliminary injunction restricting the OHP from questioning motorists about immigration status and seizing immigration documents.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

FLOC also began to expand its organizing efforts. The union sought to protect its gains in the cucumber fields by organizing migrant workers in the nation's second-largest cucumber-growing region—<region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

Mt. Olive Pickle boycott</st>

FLOC began organizing cucumber pickers and pickle processing workers in North Carolina in the early 1990s. The union's efforts had made little headway by the mid-1990s, however. In October <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/34647.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/10986934.xml">
Mount Olive Pickle Company</link></company>
, the major pickle processor in the state. The union targeted the pickle processor because it correctly believed that growers would not agree to raise wages unless Mount Olive agreed to pay more for cucumbers. The organizing campaign was a difficult one. Four FLOC organizers were arrested on <time_off wordnetid="115118453" confidence="0.8">

R.J. Reynolds Campaign</st>
<p>

In 2006, the North Carolina branch of FLOC began its new campaign against <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/142883.xml">
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company</link>.  FLOC president Baldemar Velazquez spoke of the tragic and preventable deaths of at least four migrant tobacco workers in the summer of 2006 in <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/417266.xml">

 executives to change its abusive procurement system.  </p>
<p>

Tobacco corporations have control throughout the levels of tobacco procurement.  Due to their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../878/18878.xml">
monopoly</link>, they control the prices they pay growers, and therefore the wages paid to field workers.  There are deceptive layers of subcontractors throughout this system, designed to avoid responsibility for what happens down the chain.  Nevertheless, tobacco corporations have the power to change this system and directly improve the lives of the workers who harvest their product.</p>
<p>

FLOC seeks to change the abusive structure of the procurement system through a multi-party agreement between the corporation, the growers and the farmworkers.  Thus far, Reynolds CEO Susan Ivey has refused to meet with FLOC representatives.  FLOC continues to put pressure on Reynolds to meet and recently attended a May 2008 shareholder meting to raise the issue and to support a shareholder resolution calling for the company to establish a human rights protocol throughout its supply chain. The resolution had the support of the shareholder advisory service ISS and received a significant 13% of the vote.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>

Structure</st>
<p>

FLOC is governed by its membership. The membership elects delegates, who meet every three years. FLOC held its first membership meeting—called a "constitutional convention"—in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/34754.xml">
1979</link>. Members set dues, approve policy statements and broad programmatic guidance, and elect officers. Currently, FLOC members pay 2.5% of their base wages as dues.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

Between conventions, FLOC is governed by a Board of Directors. The board includes the three officers—the international president, international vice president, and international secretary-treasurer—and four at-large board members. All board members are elected for three-year terms. At its 10th Triennial Convention in 2006, delegates elected the following individuals as board members:

Angelita Morrisroe, member at large</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Between executive board meetings, FLOC's day to day operations are governed by the three officers, led by the president.</p>
<p>

FLOC has a number of programs which it has implemented to improve the lives of its members. Since <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/34748.xml">
1971</link>, FLOC has offered educational programs, established food and fuel cooperatives, and run legal clinics for both members and non-members.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

After it achieved its contract with Campbell's Soup, FLOC sought a charter from the <union wordnetid="108233056" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/178766.xml">
AFL-CIO</link></union>
. The AFL-CIO chartered initially chartered FLOC as a <union wordnetid="108233056" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../753/2654753.xml">
directly affiliated local union</link></union>
.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> However, in February 2006, FLOC changed its affiliation with the AFL-CIO and became a fully chartered international union.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

While FLOC has a good working relationship with the United Farm Workers (UFW), neither union has sought merger with the other. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/34598.xml">
1993</link>, FLOC president Velasquez expressed doubt that his members would approve a merger.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
