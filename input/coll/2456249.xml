The <b>generalization error</b> of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/233488.xml">
machine learning</link> model is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../427/185427.xml">
function</link> that measures how far the student machine is from the teacher machine in average over the entire set of possible data that can be generated by the teacher after each iteration of the learning process. It has this name because this function indicates the capacity of a machine that learns with the specified algorithm to infer a rule (or <it>generalize</it>) that is used by the teacher machine to generate data based only on a few examples.<p>

The performance of a machine learning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> is measured by plots of the generalization error values through the learning process and are called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../332/322332.xml">
learning curves</link>.</p>
<p>

The generalization error of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/172777.xml">
perceptron</link> is the probability of the student perceptron to classify an example differently from the teacher and is given by the overlap of
the student and teacher <link>
synaptic vectors</link> and is a function of their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../093/157093.xml">
scalar product</link>.</p>
