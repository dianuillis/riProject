<b>Health education</b> is defined as the principle by which individuals and groups of people learn to behave in a manner conducive to the promotion, maintenance, or restoration of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../381/80381.xml">
health</link>. The ultimate aim of Health Education is <b>Positive Behavioural Modification</b><p>

Education for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../162/3923162.xml">
living conditions</link>. Its aim is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.
