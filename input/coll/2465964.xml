A <b>bibliogram</b> is a verbal construct made when <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/64958.xml">
noun phrase</link>s from extended stretches of text are ranked high to low by their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../019/4839019.xml">
frequency</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../802/4869802.xml">
co-occurrence</link> with one or more user-supplied seed terms. Each bibliogram has three components:<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 A seed term that sets a .</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Words that co-occur with the seed across some set of records.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Counts (frequencies) by which co-occurring words can be ordered high to low.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The term was introduced in 2005 by <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 to name the linguistic object studied, but not previously named, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../683/1799683.xml">
informetrics</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../963/1235963.xml">
scientometrics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/1223245.xml">
bibliometrics</link>. The noun phrases in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../394/1482394.xml">
ranking</link> may be authors, journals, subject headings, or other indexing terms. The "stretches of text” may be a book, a set of related articles, a subject bibliography, a set of Web pages, and so on. Bibliograms are always generated from writings, usually from scholarly or scientific literatures.  </p>
<p>

As a family of term-frequency distributions, the bibliogram has frequently been written about under  descriptions such as:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 positive skew distribution </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 empirical hyperbolic </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 scale-free (see also <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/227155.xml">
Scale-free network</link></family>
) </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/24522.xml">
power law</link> </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <link>
size frequency distribution</link></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 reverse-J</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

It is sometimes called a "core and scatter" distribution.  The "core" consists of relatively few top-ranked terms that account for a disproportionately large share of co-occurrences overall. 
The "scatter” consists of relatively many lower-ranked terms that account for the remaining share of co-occurrences. Usually the top-ranked terms are not tied in frequency, but identical frequencies and tied ranks become more common as the frequencies get smaller. At the bottom of the distribution, a long tail of terms are tied in rank because each co-occurs with the seed term only once.  </p>
<p>

In most cases bibliograms can be described by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/24522.xml">
power law</link>s such as <law wordnetid="108441203" confidence="0.8">
<structure wordnetid="105726345" confidence="0.8">
<arrangement wordnetid="105726596" confidence="0.8">
<collection wordnetid="107951464" confidence="0.8">
<group wordnetid="100031264" confidence="0.8">
<distribution wordnetid="105729036" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/43218.xml">
Zipf's law</link></distribution>
</group>
</collection>
</arrangement>
</structure>
</law>
 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../119/62119.xml">
Bradford's law</link>.  In this regard, they have long been studied by mathematicians and statisticians in information science.  However, these treatments typically ignore the qualitative meanings of the ranked terms themselves, which are often of interest in their own right. For example, the following bibliogram was made with an author's name as seed and shows the descriptors that co-occur with her name in the ERIC database.  The descriptors are ranked by how many of her articles they were used to index: </p>
<p>

6   Creativity
4   Creativity Tests
3   Divergent Thinking
2   Elementary School Mathematics
2   Instruction
2   Mathematics Education
2   Problem Solving
2   Research
2   Time
1   Acceleration

1   Child Development
1   Classroom Techniques

etc.</p>

This author is a researcher in education, and it will be seen that the terms profile her intellectual interests over the years.  In general, bibliograms can be used to:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 suggest additional terms for search strategies </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 characterize the work of scholars, scientists, or institutions</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 show who an author cites over time </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 show who cites an author over time</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 show the other authors with whom an author is co-cited over time</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 show the subjects associated with a journal or an author</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 show the authors, organizations, or journals associated with a subject</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Bibliograms can be created with the RANK command on Dialog (other vendors have similar commands), 
ranking options within <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/1339871.xml">

White suggests that bibliograms have a parallel construct in what he calls <it>associograms</it>. These are the rank-ordered lists of word association norms studied in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../538/160538.xml">
psycholinguistics</link>.  They are similar to bibliograms in statistical structure but are not generated from writings.  Rather, they are generated by presenting panels of people with a stimulus term (which functions like a seed term) and tabulating the words they associate with the seed by frequency of co-occurrence.   They are currently of interest to information scientists as a nonstandard way of creating thesauri for document retrieval.  </p>

 Examples </st>

<p>

Other examples of bibliograms are the ordered set of an author's <link>
co-authors</link> or the list of authors that are published in a specific journal together with their number of articles. A popular  example is the list of additional titles to consider for purchase that you get when you search an item in <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.8">
<shop wordnetid="104202417" confidence="0.8">
<structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">
<mercantile_establishment wordnetid="103748162" confidence="0.8">
<artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<instrumentality wordnetid="103575240" confidence="0.8">
<bookshop wordnetid="102871525" confidence="0.8">
<place_of_business wordnetid="103953020" confidence="0.8">
<establishment wordnetid="103297735" confidence="0.8">
<device wordnetid="103183080" confidence="0.8">
<machine wordnetid="103699975" confidence="0.8">
<web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../451/90451.xml">

</machine>
</device>
</establishment>
</place_of_business>
</bookshop>
</instrumentality>
</artifact>
</mercantile_establishment>
</structure>
</shop>
</computer>
.  These suggested titles are the top terms in the "core" of a bibliogram formed with your search term as seed.  The frequencies are counts of the times they have been co-purchased with the seed.</p>
