<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../554/1249554.xml">
Program trading</link> is defined by the New York Stock Exchange as an order to buy or sell 15 or more stocks valued at over $1 million total.  In practice this means that all program trades are entered with the aid of a computer.  In the 1980s program trading became widely used in trading between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/19372783.xml">
equity</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/240655.xml">
futures</link> markets. </p>
<p>

In stock <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../186/5576186.xml">
index arbitrage</link> a trader would buy (sell) a stock index futures contract such as the <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

</message>
 futures and sell (buy) a portfolio of up to 500 stocks at the NYSE matched against the futures trade.  The program trade at the NYSE would be pre-programmed into a computer to enter the order automatically into the NYSE’s electronic order routing system at a time when the futures price and the stock index were far enough apart to make a profit.</p>
<p>

At about the same time <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../909/4733909.xml">
portfolio insurance</link> was designed to create a synthetic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../383/207383.xml">

Black-Scholes</link> option pricing model.</p>
<p>

Both strategies, often simply lumped together as “program trading,” were blamed by many people (for example by the <senator wordnetid="110578471" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/542839.xml">
Brady report</link></senator>
) for exacerbating or even starting the <link>
1987 stock market crash</link>.</p>
<p>

Financial markets with fully electronic execution and similar <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../683/1440683.xml">
electronic communication network</link>s developed in the late 1980s and 1990s.  In the U.S., <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../017/211017.xml">
decimalization</link>, which changed the minimum tick size from 1/16th of a dollar ($0.0625) to $0.01 per share, may have encouraged algorithmic trading as it changed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/6483334.xml">
market microstructure</link> by permitting smaller differences between the bid and offer prices, decreasing the market-makers' trading advantage, thus decreasing market <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/56121.xml">
liquidity</link>.</p>
<p>

This decreased market <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/56121.xml">
liquidity</link> led to institutional traders splitting up orders according to computer algorithms in order to execute their orders at a better average price.  These average price benchmarks are measured and calculated by computers by applying the time weighted (i.e unweighted) average price <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../885/5693885.xml">
TWAP</link> or more usually by the volume weighted average price <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/1869136.xml">
VWAP</link>.</p>
<p>

As more electronic markets opened, other algorithmic trading strategies became possible including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../162/3162.xml">
arbitrage</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../949/1137949.xml">
statistical arbitrage</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/6597175.xml">
trend following</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../014/14013014.xml">
mean reversion</link>. These strategies are more easily implemented by computers because machines can react more rapidly to temporary mispricing and examine prices from several markets simultaneously.</p>

Communication Standards</st>

<p>

Algorithmic trades require communicating considerably more parameters than traditional market and limit orders. A trader on one end (the “<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/5018398.xml">
buy side</link>“) must enable their trading system (often called an “<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/7794373.xml">
Order Management System</link>” or “Execution Management System”) to understand a constantly proliferating flow of new algorithmic order types. The R&amp;D and other costs to construct complex new algorithmic orders types, along with the execution infrastructure, and marketing costs to distribute them, are fairly substantial. What was needed was a way that marketers (the “<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/5018422.xml">
sell side</link>”) could express algo orders electronically such that buy-side traders could just drop the new order types into their system and be ready to trade them without constant coding custom new order entry screens each time.</p>

Strategies</st>

<p>

Many different algorithms have been developed to implement different trading strategies.  These algorithms or techniques are commonly given names such as "iceberging", "Dagger", "Guerrilla", "benchmarking", "Sniper" and "Snif-fer".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

<ss1>
<st>
Transaction cost reduction</st>

<p>

Large orders are broken down into several smaller orders and entered into the market over time. This basic strategy is called "iceberging". The success of this strategy may be measured by the average purchase price against the VWAP for the market over that time period.  One algorithm designed to find hidden orders or icebergs is called "Guerrilla".</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Arbitrage</st>

<p>

A classical arbitrage strategy might involve three or four securities such as covered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/2406246.xml">
interest rate parity</link> in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/648277.xml">
foreign exchange market</link> which gives a relation between the prices of a domestic bond, a bond denominated in a foreign currency, the spot price of the currency, and the price of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../379/243379.xml">
forward contract</link> on the currency.  If the market prices are sufficiently different from those implied in the model to cover transactions cost then four transactions can be made to guarantee a risk-free profit.  Algorithmic trading allows similar arbitrages using models of greater complexity involving many more than 4 securities.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Market Making</st>

<p>

Market making involves placing a limit order to sell (or offer) above the current market price or a buy limit order (or bid) below the current price in order to benefit from the bid-ask spread.  Automated Trading Desk, which was bought by Citigroup in July 2007, has been an active market maker, accounting for about 6% of total volume on both NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
More Complicated Strategies</st>

<p>

A "benchmarking" algorithm is used by traders attempting to mimic an index's return. An algorithm designed to discover which markets are most volatile or unstable is called "Snif-fer".</p>
<p>

Any type of algo trading which depends on the programming skills of other algo traders is called <b>gaming.</b>  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/11951589.xml">
Dark pool</link>s are alternative electronic stock exchanges where trading takes place anonymously, with most orders hidden or "iceburged."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>  Gamers or "sharks" sniff out large orders by "pinging" small market orders to buy and sell.  When several small orders are filled the sharks may have discovered the presence of a large iceburged order.  They then <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/2335596.xml">
front run</link> the order.</p>

<p>

"They look for big, dumb elephants leaving big footprints," said Joe Saluzzi, head of equity trading at Themis Trading.... "If you're getting tapped by odd lots, if it happens 40 times...you're being gamed." </p>

<p>

Any sort of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../706/126706.xml">
pattern recognition</link> or predictive model can be used to initiate algo trading.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../542/1729542.xml">
Neural network</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/12424.xml">
genetic programming</link> have been used to create these models.  </p>
<p>

“Now it’s an arms race,” said Andrew Lo, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Laboratory for Financial Engineering. “Everyone is building more sophisticated algorithms, and the more competition exists, the smaller the profits.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

</ss1>

<st>
Issues and Developments</st>

<p>

More sophisticated models and intelligent programs have created the question of whether the models will break down.</p>
<p>

“The downside with these systems is their black box-ness,” Mr. Williams said. “Traders have intuitive senses of how the world works. But with these systems you pour in a bunch of numbers, and something comes out the other end, and it’s not always intuitive or clear why the black box latched onto certain data or relationships.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>
<p>

Regulators in Great Britain are watching the development of algo trading.</p>
<p>

“The Financial Services Authority has been keeping a watchful eye on the development of black box trading. In its annual report the regulator remarked on the great benefits of efficiency that new technology is bringing to the market. But it also pointed out that ‘greater reliance on sophisticated technology and modelling brings with it a greater risk that systems failure can result in business interruption’.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>

<p>

Other issues include the technical problem of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/17933.xml">
latency</link> or the delay in getting quotes to traders,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> security and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/2335596.xml">
front running</link>, and the possibility of a complete system breakdown leading to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/63074.xml">
market crash</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

The cost of developing and maintaining algorithms is still relatively high, especially for new entrants, as the need for stability, bandwidth and speed is even higher than for regular order execution.  Firms which have not developed their own algorithmic trading have had to buy competing firms.
"Goldman spends tens of millions of dollars on this stuff. They have more people working in their technology area than people on the trading desk...The nature of the markets has changed dramatically."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
<p>

Financial market news is now being formatted by firms such as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/18998750.xml">
Reuters</link></company>
, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/46638.xml">
Dow Jones</link>, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/432006.xml">
Bloomberg</link></company>
, and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/483279.xml">
Thomson Financial</link></institution>
</company>
, to be read and traded on via algorithms.</p>
<p>

“Computers are now being used to generate news stories about company earnings results or economic statistics as they are released.  And this almost instantaneous information forms a direct feed into other computers which trade on the news.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref>  </p>
<p>

The algorithms do not simply trade on simple news stories but also interpret more difficult to understand news.  Some firms are also attempting to automatically assign <it>sentiment</it> (deciding if the news is good or bad) to news stories so that automated trading can work directly on the news story.</p>
<p>

“There is a real interest in moving the process of interpreting news from the humans to the machines” says Kiristi Suutani, global business manager of algorithmic trading at Reuters.  “More of our customers are finding ways to use news content to make money.”<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> </p>
<p>

An example of the importance of reporting speed to algorithmic traders was an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../861/2861.xml">
advertising</link> campaign by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/46638.xml">
Dow Jones</link> (appearances included page W15 of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/173070.xml">
Wall Street Journal</link>, on March 1, 2008) claiming that their service had beaten other news services by 2 seconds in reporting an interest rate cut by the Bank of England.</p>
<p>

In July 2007, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/207299.xml">
Citigroup</link></company>
, which had already developed its own trading algorithms, paid $680 million for Automated Trading Desk, a 19 year old firm that trades about 200 million shares a day, accounting for about 6 percent of trading volume in U.S. markets.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>   Citigroup had previously bought Lava Trading and OnTrade Inc.</p>

<p>

Though its development may have been prompted by decreasing trade sizes caused by decimalization, algorithmic trading has reduced trade sizes further.  Jobs once done by human traders are being switched to computers.  The speeds of computer connections, measured in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/36153.xml">
millisecond</link>s, have become very important. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

More fully automated markets such as NASDAQ have gained market share from less automated markets such as the NYSE.  Economies of scale in electronic trading have contributed to lowering commissions and trade processing fees, and contributed to international mergers and consolidation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/41916.xml">
 financial exchanges</link>.  </p>
<p>

Competition is developing among exchanges for the fastest processing times for completing trades.  For example the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/197867.xml">
London Stock Exchange</link></institution>
</company>
, in June 2007, started a new system called TradElect, which promises an average 10 millisecond turnaround time from placing an order to final confirmation, and can process 3,000 orders per second.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

Spending on computers and software in the financial industry increased to $26.4 billion in 2005.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>  </p>
<p>

Brokers have found it more difficult to monitor the risk of their clients' positions, especially for clients such as hedge funds.</p>
