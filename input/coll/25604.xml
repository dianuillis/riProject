inert</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/18993869.xml">
gas</link>es. It is inert to most common chemical reactions, such as combustion, because the outer <link>

Radon is found in some petroleum. Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve as propane, and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points, the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become partially radioactive due to radon decay particles.  Residues from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
oil</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../131/22131.xml">
gas</link> industry often contain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/25602.xml">
radium</link> and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contains radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. An oil processing plant, the area of the plant where <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../643/23643.xml">
propane</link> is processed, is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point as propane.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref></p>

Radon, along with the noble gases <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/10624594.xml">

xenon</link>, is also produced during the operation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/22153.xml">
nuclear power plants</link>.  A small fraction of it leaks out of the fuel, through the cladding, and into the cooling water, from which it is scavenged.  It is then routed to a holding tank where it remains for a large number of half-lives.  It is finally purged to the open air through a tall stack, which is carefully monitored for radiation level.</p>

Radon collects over samples of radium-226 at a rate of about 0.001 cm3/day per gram of radium. The radon (222Rn) released into the air decays to 210Pb and other radioisotopes, the levels of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/17747.xml">
210Pb</link> can be measured.  The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is dependent on the weather. In the early part of the 20th century in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/3434750.xml">

Radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content, so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree. This fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists. Because of radon's rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay, radon is used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/13435.xml">
hydrologic</link> research that studies the interaction between ground water and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/18842308.xml">
stream</link>s. Any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of ground water. Radon is also used in the dating of oil-containing soils because radon has a high affinity of oil-like substances.</p>
<p>

Radon soil-concentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried close-subsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults. Similarly, it has found some limited use in geothermal prospecting. Some researchers have also looked at elevated soil-gas radon concentrations, or rapid changes in soil or groundwater radon concentrations, as a predictor for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../106/10106.xml">
earthquake</link>s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2252%22])">52</ref> Results have been generally unconvincing but may ultimately prove to have some limited use in specific locations.</p>
<p>

Radon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations, though it disperses rapidly, and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations. The trend in geothermal plants is to reinject all emissions by pumping deep underground, and this seems likely to ultimately decrease such radon hazards further.</p>

Transient weather can affect short term measurements.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2257%22])">57</ref> Therefore, a high result (over 4 pc/l) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects.  Measurements between 4 and 10 pc/l warrant a long term radon test. Measurements over 10 pc/l warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed.  Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4 pc/l or less.</p>

The National Environmental Health Association administers a voluntary National Radon Proficiency Program for radon professionals consisting of individuals and companies wanting to take training courses and examinations to demonstrate their competency.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2258%22])">58</ref> A list of mitigation service providers is available.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2259%22])">59</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../319/3818319.xml">
Indoor radon can be mitigated</link> by sealing basement foundations, water drainage, or by sub-slab de-pressurization. In severe cases, mitigation can use air pipes and fans to exhaust sub-slab air to the outside. Indoor ventilation systems are more effective, but exterior ventilation can be cost-effective in some cases.</p>
<p>

Modern construction that conserves energy by making homes air tight exacerbates the risks of radon exposure if radon is present in the home.  Older homes with more porous construction are more likely to vent radon naturally.  Positive-pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside, and it should be noted that simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas <it>into</it> a dwelling.  Homes built on a crawl space can benefit from a radon collector installed under a radon barrier (a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space).</p>

Radon is the invisible, radioactive atomic gas that results from radioactive decay of some forms of uranium that may be found in rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves. Radon is most likely the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, and is probably responsible for tens of thousands of lung cancer deaths per year. There are relatively simple tests for radon gas, but these tests are not commonly done, even in areas of known systematic hazards. Radon is a very heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the floor level. Building materials can be a significant source of radon, but very little testing is done for stone, rock, or tile products brought into building sites. The half-life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. However, annually, thousands of people go to radon-contaminated mines for deliberate exposure to help with the symptoms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/1776.xml">
arthritis</link> without any serious health effects.</p>
<p>

Radon presents significant risks, since it is a colorless and odorless <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/18993869.xml">
gas</link>, and therefore not readily detectable by a human. The radiation decay products <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../787/18963787.xml">
ion</link>ize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon exposure is the second major cause of lung cancer after smoking.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2260%22])">60</ref> Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. For example, in areas such as <county wordnetid="108546183" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Radon is a terrestrial source of radiation of particular concern because — although on average it is very rare — this intensely radioactive element can be found in high concentrations in many areas of the world, where it represents a significant health hazard. Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the earth's crust, but generally concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these ores into the atmosphere or into ground water, and in these localities it can accumulate within dwellings and expose humans to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe. Some of these areas, including <county wordnetid="108546183" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The general effects of radon to the human body are caused by its radioactivity and consequent risk of radiation-induced cancer. As an inert gas, radon has a low solubility in body fluids, which leads to a uniform distribution of the gas throughout the body. Radon gas and its solid decay products are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/6445.xml">
carcinogen</link>s.  The greatest health risks come from exposure to the inhaled solid radon gas decay products that are produced during its radioactive decay.  Two of these decay products, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/23325.xml">
polonium</link>-218 and 214, present a significant radiologic hazard.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2267%22])">67</ref> Once the radioactive decay products are inhaled into the lung, they undergo further radioactive decay, releasing small bursts of energy in the form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../804/37804.xml">

It is not known whether radon can cause health effects in other organs besides the lungs. The effects of radon, if found in food or drinking water, are unknown.</p>
