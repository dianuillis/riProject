<b>Risk</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/6978.xml">
concept</link> that denotes the precise probability of specific eventualities. Technically, the notion of risk is independent from the notion of value and, as such, eventualities may have both beneficial and adverse consequences. However in general usage the convention is to focus only on potential negative impact to some characteristic of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/4095185.xml">
value</link> that may arise from a future <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/22961.xml">

Definitions of risk</st>
<p>

There are many definitions of <it>risk</it> that vary by specific application and situational context.  One is that risk is an issue, which can be avoided or mitigated (wherein an issue is a potential problem that has to be fixed now.)
Risk is described both qualitatively and quantitatively. In some texts risk is described as a situation which would lead to negative consequences.</p>
<p>

Qualitatively, risk is proportional to both the expected losses which may be caused by an event and to the probability of this event.  Greater loss and greater event likelihood result in a greater overall risk.</p>
<p>

Frequently in the subject matter literature, <it>risk</it> is defined in pseudo-formal forms where the components of the definition are vague
and ill-defined, for example, <it>risk</it> is considered as an indicator of , or depends on threats, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/926974.xml">
vulnerability</link>, impact and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/63778.xml">
uncertainty</link>.</p>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/9251.xml">
engineering</link>, the definition <it>risk</it> often simply is:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math> \text{Risk} = (\text{probability of an accident}) \times  (\text{losses per accident}).\, </math>
</indent>

Or in more general terms:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math> \text{Risk} = (\text{probability of event occurring}) \times  (\text{impact of event occuring}).\, </math>
</indent>

There are more sophisticated definitions, however. Measuring engineering risk is often difficult, especially in potentially dangerous industries such as nuclear energy.  Often, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/22934.xml">
probability</link> of a negative event is estimated by using the frequency of past similar events or by event-tree methods, but probabilities for rare failures may be difficult to estimate if an event tree cannot be formulated.  Methods to calculate the cost of the loss of human life vary depending on the purpose of the calculation.  Specific methods include what people are willing to pay to insure against death,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> and radiological release (e.g., GBq of radio-iodine).
There are many formal methods used to assess or to "measure" risk,  considered as one of the critical indicators important for human <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../752/265752.xml">
decision making</link>.</p>

 is often defined as the unexpected variability or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../108/11930108.xml">
volatility</link> of returns and thus includes both potential worse-than-expected as well as better-than-expected returns. References to negative risk below should be read as applying to positive impacts or opportunity (e.g., for "loss" read "loss or gain") unless the context precludes.</p>
<p>

In statistics, risk is often mapped to the probability of some event which is seen as undesirable. Usually, the probability of that event and some assessment of its expected harm must be combined into a believable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/38900.xml">
scenario</link> (an outcome), which combines the set of risk, regret and reward probabilities into an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/9653.xml">
expected value</link> for that outcome.  (See also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/736803.xml">

</indent>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../036/15036.xml">
information security</link> , a <it>risk</it> is defined as a function of three variables:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

the probability that there is a threat</entry>

the probability that there are any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/926974.xml">
vulnerabilities</link></entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

the potential impact.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

If any of these variables approaches zero, the overall risk approaches zero.</p>

... Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. The term "risk," as loosely used in everyday speech and in economic discussion, really covers two things which, functionally at least, in their causal relations to the phenomena of economic organization, are categorically different. ... The essential fact is that "risk" means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomenon depending on which of the two is really present and operating. ... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or "risk" proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We ... accordingly restrict the term "uncertainty" to cases of the non-quantitive type.</col>

A solution to this ambiguity is proposed in "How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business" by Doug Hubbard:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

<indent level="2">

<b>Uncertainty</b>: The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility.  The "true" outcome/state/result/value is not known.
</indent>

<indent level="2">

<b>Measurement of uncertainty</b>: A set of probabilities assigned to a set of possibilities.  Example: "There is a 60% chance this market will double in five years"
</indent>

<indent level="2">

<b>Risk</b>: A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.
</indent>

<indent level="2">

<b>Measurement of risk</b>: A set of possibilities each with quantified probabilities and quantified losses. Example: "There is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs".
</indent>

In this sense, Hubbard uses the terms so that one may have uncertainty without risk but not risk without uncertainty.  We can be uncertain about the winner of a contest, but unless we have some personal stake in it, we have no risk.  If we bet money on the outcome of the contest, then we have a risk.  In both cases there are more than one outcome.  The measure of uncertainty refers only to the probabilities assigned to outcomes, while the measure of risk requires both probabilities for outcomes and losses quantified for outcomes.</p>

Insurance and health risk</st>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/15176.xml">
Insurance</link> is a risk-reducing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/63121.xml">
investment</link> in which the buyer pays a small fixed amount to be protected from a potential large loss. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/11921.xml">
Gambling</link> is a risk-increasing investment, wherein money on hand is risked for a possible large return, but with the possibility of losing it all.  Purchasing a lottery ticket is a very risky investment with a high chance of no return and a small chance of a very high return.  In contrast, putting money in a bank at a defined rate of interest is a risk-averse action that gives a guaranteed return of a small gain and precludes other investments with possibly higher gain.</p>
<p>

Risks in personal health may be reduced by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/3964005.xml">
primary prevention</link> actions that decrease early causes of illness or by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../005/3964005.xml">

risk factors</link> with individual patients to obtain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../355/50355.xml">
informed consent</link> for secondary and tertiary prevention efforts, whereas public health efforts in primary prevention require education of the entire population at risk. In each case, careful communication about risk factors, likely outcomes and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/993153.xml">
certainty</link> must distinguish between causal events that must be decreased and associated events that may be merely consequences rather than causes.</p>

Insight</st>

<p>

The central insight in the methodology for incorporating economic risks arise from the realization of the fact that however manifold and diverse might be the causes, or factors, of risks around a specific project or business (for instance, the hike in the price for raw materials, the lapsing of deadlines for construction of a new operating facility, disruptions in a production process, emergence of a serious competitor on the market, the loss of key personnel, the change of a political regime, natural contingencies, etc.), all of these are ultimately manifested under only two guises. According to CCF Conception the economic risk consists in that: "Actual positive conventional cash flows (income, inflows) turn out to be less than expected AND / OR Actual negative conventional cash flows (expenditures, outflows) turn out to be larger than expected (in absolute terms)".</p>
<p>

Such lucid and unambiguous conceptual treatment of such a complex and multi-faceted notion as the economic risk emphasizes the very core of the question.  The "economic risk is not an abstract ‘uncertainty’ or ‘possibility of failure’ or changeableness (variability) of the outcome… The economic risk – is a monetary amount which might be under-collected and/or over-paid." Just as in music, one must use musical notes and staves—not alphabet letters or colors—to render a melody, in describing economic risk, we must ultimately operate with monetary units and not with the percentages of discount rates, magnitudes of volatility or anything else.
(See <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1012812">
http://ssrn.com/abstract=1012812</weblink>.)</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
In business</st>
<p>

Means of assessing risk vary widely between professions. Indeed, they may define these professions; for example, a doctor manages medical risk, while a civil engineer manages risk of structural failure. A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../809/290809.xml">
professional</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/11228852.xml">
code of ethics</link> is usually focused on risk assessment and mitigation (by the professional on behalf of client, public, society or life in general).</p>
<p>

In the workplace, incidental and inherent risks exist. Incidental risks are those which occur naturally in the business but are not part of the core of the business. Inherent risks have a negative effect on the operating profit of the business.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Criticism</st>

<p>

Criticism has been leveled at the amoral ("rational") application of quantitative risk assessment. </p>

</ss1>

<st>
Risk-sensitive industries</st>
<p>

Some industries manage risk in a highly quantified and numerate way. These include the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/22153.xml">
nuclear power</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../610/79610.xml">
aircraft industries</link>, where the possible failure of a complex series of engineered systems could result in highly undesirable outcomes. The usual measure of risk for a class of events is then:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

 <it>R</it> = probability of the event &amp;times; <it>C</it>
</indent>

The total risk is then the sum of the individual class-risks.</p>
<p>

In the nuclear industry, consequence is often measured in terms of off-site radiological release, and this is often banded into five or six decade-wide bands.</p>
<p>

The risks are evaluated using fault tree/event tree techniques (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/29278.xml">
safety engineering</link>). Where these risks are low, they are normally considered to be "Broadly Acceptable". A higher level of risk (typically up to 10 to 100 times what is considered Broadly Acceptable) has to be justified against the costs of reducing it further and the possible benefits that make it tolerable—these risks are described as "Tolerable if <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../151/2050151.xml">
ALARP</link>". Risks beyond this level are classified as "Intolerable".</p>
<p>

The level of risk deemed Broadly Acceptable has been considered by regulatory bodies in various countries—an early attempt by UK government regulator and academic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../064/9315064.xml">
F. R. Farmer</link> used the example of hill-walking and similar activities which have definable risks that people appear to find acceptable. This resulted in the so-called Farmer Curve of acceptable probability of an event versus its consequence.</p>
<p>

The technique as a whole is usually referred to as Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) (or Probabilistic Safety Assessment, PSA). See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../370/2142370.xml">
WASH-1400</link> for an example of this approach.</p>

In finance, risk is the probability that an investment's actual return will be different than expected. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. It is usually measured by calculating the standard deviation of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment. </p>
<p>

gambling</link>" (increasing measurable risk and exposing the investor to catastrophic loss in pursuit of very high windfalls that increase expected value).</p>
<p>

As <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../086/4052086.xml">
regret</link> measures rarely reflect actual human risk-aversion, it is difficult to determine if the outcomes of such transactions will be satisfactory. Risk seeking describes an individual whose utility function's second derivative is positive. Such an individual would willingly (actually pay a premium to) assume all risk in the economy and is hence not likely to exist.</p>
<p>

In financial markets, one may need to measure <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/372603.xml">
credit risk</link>, information timing and source risk, probability model risk, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../298/1134298.xml">
legal risk</link> if there are regulatory or civil actions taken as a result of some "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/16695601.xml">
investor's regret</link>".</p>
<p>

"A fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return. The greater the amount of risk that an investor is willing to take on, the greater the potential return. The reason for this is that investors need to be compensated for taking on additional risk."</p>
<p>

"For example, a US Treasury bond is considered to be one of the safest investments and, when compared to a corporate bond, provides a lower rate of return. The reason for this is that a corporation is much more likely to go bankrupt than the U.S. government. Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a higher rate of return."</p>

In public works</st>
<p>

In a peer reviewed study of risk in public works projects located in twenty nations on five continents, Flyvbjerg, Holm, and Buhl (2002, 2005) documented high risks for such ventures for both costs <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://flyvbjerg.plan.aau.dk/JAPAASPUBLISHED.pdf">
http://flyvbjerg.plan.aau.dk/JAPAASPUBLISHED.pdf</weblink> and demand <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://flyvbjerg.plan.aau.dk/Traffic91PRINTJAPA.pdf">
http://flyvbjerg.plan.aau.dk/Traffic91PRINTJAPA.pdf</weblink>. Actual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/166789.xml">
cost</link>s of projects were typically higher than estimated costs; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/6832338.xml">
cost overruns</link> of 50% were common, overruns above 100% not uncommon. Actual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/920978.xml">
demand</link> was often lower than estimated; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../327/15411327.xml">
demand shortfalls</link> of 25% were common, of 50% not uncommon.</p>
<p>

Due to such cost and demand risks, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/374583.xml">
cost-benefit analyses</link> of public works projects have proved to be highly uncertain.</p>
<p>

The main causes of cost and demand risks were found to be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../456/7224456.xml">
optimism bias</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../983/9508983.xml">

In human services</st>

<p>

Huge ethical and political issues arise when human beings themselves are seen or treated as 'risks', or when the risk decision making of people who use human services might have an impact on that service. The experience of many people who rely on human services for support is that 'risk' is often used as a reason to prevent them from gaining further independence or fully accessing the community, and that these services are often unnecessarily risk averse.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

Regret</st>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../216/446216.xml">
decision theory</link>, regret (and anticipation of regret) can play a significant part in decision-making, distinct from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/177700.xml">

Framing</st>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/41177.xml">
Framing</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> is a fundamental problem with all forms of risk assessment. In particular, because of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../400/70400.xml">
bounded rationality</link> (our brains get overloaded, so we take mental shortcuts), the risk of extreme events is discounted because the probability is too low to evaluate intuitively. As an example, one of the leading causes of death is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../798/3080798.xml">
road accident</link>s caused by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/511428.xml">
drunk driving</link>—partly because any given driver frames the problem by largely or totally ignoring the risk of a serious or fatal accident.</p>
<p>

For instance, an extremely disturbing event (an attack by hijacking, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../590/175590.xml">
moral hazard</link>s) may be ignored in analysis despite the fact it has occurred and has a nonzero probability.  Or, an event that everyone agrees is inevitable may be ruled out of analysis due to greed or an unwillingness to admit that it is believed to be inevitable. These human tendencies to error and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/386062.xml">
wishful thinking</link> often affect even the most rigorous applications of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../833/26833.xml">

Fear as intuitive risk assessment</st>
<p>

For the time being, people rely on their fear and hesitation to keep them out of the most profoundly unknown circumstances.</p>

 argues that "True fear is a gift. It is a survival signal that sounds only in the presence of danger. Yet unwarranted fear has assumed a power over us that it holds over no other creature on Earth. It need not be this way."</p>
<p>

Risk could be said to be the way we collectively measure and share this "true fear"—a fusion of rational doubt, irrational fear, and a set of unquantified biases from our own experience.</p>
<p>

The field of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/177698.xml">
behavioral finance</link> focuses on human risk-aversion, asymmetric regret, and other ways that human financial behavior varies from what analysts call "rational". Risk in that case is the degree of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/63778.xml">
uncertainty</link> associated with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../606/3361606.xml">
return</link> on an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/18934838.xml">
asset</link>.</p>
<p>

Recognizing and respecting the irrational influences on human decision making may do much to reduce disasters caused by naive risk assessments that pretend to rationality but in fact merely fuse many shared biases together.</p>
