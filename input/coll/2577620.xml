<b>Net-centric</b>: (adj.) (Also spelled "netcentric"): Participating as a part of a continuously-evolving, complex community of people, devices, information and services interconnected by a communications network to achieve optimal benefit of resources and better synchronization of events and their consequences.   </p>
<p>

In military connotation frequently associated with terms "Net-centric Operations (NCO)" and "Net-centric Warfare (NCW)".  Many people use the terms "net-centric" and "network-centric" interchangibly.  Some consider "network-centric" to refer to activities within a particular network and "net-centric" to refer to activities that cross networks.) </p>
<p>

Many experts believe the terms "information-centric" or "knowledge-centric" would capture the concepts more aptly because the objective is to find and exploit information, the network itself is only one of several enabling factors. The best commercial practitioners of globally distributed supply chain management employ net-centric methods.</p>

A <b>NetCentric Enterprise Architecture</b> is defined in lay terms as a: "massively distributed  architecture with components and/or services available across and throughout an enterprise's entire <link>
lines-of-business</link>."</p>
<p>

The formal definition of a "NetCentric Enterprise Architecture" is: "A NetCentric Enterprise Architecture is a light-weight, massively distributed, horizontally-applied architecture, that distributes components and/or services across an enterprise's information value chain using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">

information services</link>." </p>

Net-Centricity in the U.S. Department of Defense</st>

The Concept of Network Centric Warfare was famously introduced to the U.S. Department of Defense by David Alberts, Vice Admiral Art Cebrowski, and John Gartska in a series of articles beginning in the late 1990s. The <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 established the net-centric model as the architectural foundation for its <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../928/1953928.xml">
