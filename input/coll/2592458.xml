education</link> method that became popular at a global scale during the early 19th century.

The Monitorial System was found very useful by 19th-century educators, as it proved to be a cheap way of making primary education more inclusive, thus making it possible to increase the average class size.

, writing in the 1880s, distinguishes between the Lancasterian system and the Madras System <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. The Lancasterian System is described as preferring smaller classes, unlike Bell's Madras System. Lancaster specified an ideal classroom (hall) as being a "parallelogram, the length about twice the width. The windows were to be six feet from the floor. The floor should be inclined, rising one foot in twenty from the master's desk to the upper end of the room, where the highest class is situated. The master's desk is on the middle of a platform two to three feet high, erected at the lower end of the room. Forms and desks, fixed firmly to the ground, occupy the middle of the room, a passage being left between the ends of the forms and the wall, five or six feet broad, where the children form semicircles for reading."</p>
<p>

According to <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/10771308.xml">

, to stimulate effort and reward merit, "Lancaster used Place Taking abundantly. He also had medals and badges of merit .. Tickets could be earned too; these had a trifling pecuniary value." Prizes were given "to excess" ceremonially.</p>
<p>

Frequent changes of routine aided discipline. A code of command, and exact movements also reinforced discipline. Class lists and registers were kept.</p>
<p>

Children were classified on a dual principle according to their ability in reading, and arithmetic. </p>
<p>

Lancaster described his system as to produce a 'Christian Education' and "train children in the practise of such moral habits as are conducive to the welfare of society."</p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../798/4445798.xml">
Bell</link>'s "Madras System" was so named because it originated at the Military Male Orphan Asylum, Egmore, near Madras. <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../308/10771308.xml">
Gladman</link></person>
 describes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../798/4445798.xml">
Bell</link>'s system from notes taken from "Bell's Manual" which had been published by the National Society two years after <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../798/4445798.xml">
Bell</link>'s death, in 1832. "after observing children in a native school, seated on the ground, and writing in the sand .. he set a boy, John Frisken, to teach the alphabet on the same principle .. Bell was consequently led to extend and elaborate the system."</p>
<p>

Bell declared "There is a faculty, inherent in the mind, of conveying and receiving mutual instruction." In 1796, John Frisken was 12 years and 8 months. With assistants, he was in charge of 91 boys.</p>
<p>

The school was arranged in forms or classes, each consisting of about 36 members of similar proficiency, as classified by reading ability.</p>
<p>

The young teachers were kept to task through registers. Reading, Ciphering and Religious rehearsals were tracked through the Paidometer register. Discipline held through a Black Book, which had entries read to the entire school, and faults were commented on in moral terms.</p>
<p>

The hall was built in rectangles, with windows five feet from the floor, but opening at the top. Desks were placed against walls, and the Master's desk was raised, a practise that displeased Gladman, who remarked "Fixing the master thus, deprived him of much of his power; he would do more good in passing from class to class, and teaching."</p>

Development</st>
<p>

Despite the many similarities of the two systems, and the initial friendship of Lancaster and Bell, divisions appeared between the advocates. In 1805, a Mrs Trimmer published a paper claiming Lancaster's system was antagonistic to the National Church. It was said that the country was soon divided into two camps; speeches, sermons, magazine articles and pamphlets appeared on each side. The National Society was formed to propagate Bell's System and the B&amp;FSS was formed to propagate Lancaster's System.</p>
