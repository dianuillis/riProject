food</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../957/18957.xml">

Once Soviet imports fell, Cuba faced a net deficit of oil, resulting in a need to reduce domestic consumption by 20% over the course of two years.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>.  The effect was felt immediately; dependent on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/48146.xml">
fossil fuel</link>s to operate, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18580879.xml">
transportation</link>, industrial and agricultural systems were paralyzed.   There were extensive losses of productivity in both Cuban agriculture &mdash; which was dominated by modern industrial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../692/152692.xml">
tractor</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../388/247388.xml">
combine</link>s, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../156/332156.xml">
harvester</link>s, all of which required oil to run &mdash; and in Cuban industrial capacity.</p>
<p>

The early stages of the Special Period were defined by a general breakdown in transportation and agricultural sectors, fertilizer and pesticide stocks (both of those being manufactured primarily from oil derivatives), and widespread food shortages, although outright <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../891/215891.xml">
starvation</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/51329.xml">
famine</link> were averted. <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

n and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/78214.xml">
permaculturists</link> arriving in Cuba at the time began to distribute aid and taught their techniques to locals, who soon implemented them in Cuban fields, raised beds, and urban rooftops across the nation.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/72754.xml">
Organic agriculture</link> was soon after mandated by the Cuban government, supplanting the old industrialized form of agriculture Cubans had grown accustomed to.  <link>
Relocalization</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/78214.xml">
permaculture</link>, and innovative modes of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../894/23894.xml">
mass transit</link> had to be rapidly developed.</p>
<p>

For a time, waiting for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/4146.xml">
bus</link> could take three hours, power outages could last up to 16 hours, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/10646.xml">
food</link> consumption was cut up to 1/5 and the average Cuban lost about 20 pounds.  Although <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../891/215891.xml">
starvation</link> was avoided, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/149422.xml">
hunger</link> was a daily experience and initially, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/258979.xml">
malnutrition</link> in children under five was evident after just a few weeks of food shortages.</p>

The Toricelli Act(October 1992) also prohibits foreign-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies from trading with Cuba but adds prohibition of travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, and monetary assistance to family members in Cuba.   The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/18949668.xml">

n nations, in an attempt to earn the foreign currency necessary to replace the lost Soviet oil via the international <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../416/5416.xml">

steel</link> and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../595/22595.xml">
ore</link>-based supplies, Cuba closed refineries and factories across the country, eliminating the country's industrial arm and many of jobs. Alternative transportation, most notably the Cuban "camels" &mdash; immense 18-wheeler tractor trailers retrofitted as busses to carry many dozens of Cubans each &mdash; flourished. Meat and dairy products, having been extremely fossil fuel dependent in their former <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../473/419473.xml">
factory farming</link> methods, soon diminished in the Cuban diet. By necessity Cubans adopted diets higher in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/140558.xml">

Government response</st>
<p>

Immediate actions taken by the government included televising an announcement of the expected <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/261316.xml">
energy crisis</link> a week before the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../779/26779.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/5042481.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Government+and+politics%22])">

 that they would not be delivering the expected quota of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
crude oil</link>. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/46011.xml">
Citizen</link>s were asked to reduce their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/570984.xml">
consumption</link> in all areas and to use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../894/23894.xml">
public transportation</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/383038.xml">
carpooling</link>. As time went on, more structured strategies were developed to manage what would turnout to be a long-term energy/economic crisis which would take them into the 21st century.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Food rations</st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../130/250130.xml">
Food rations</link> were intensified.  Monthly allocations for families were based on basic minimum requirements as recommended by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../769/31769.xml">
United Nations</link>.  However, at the worst of times, the rations were only 1/5 of these consumption amounts.</p>

 Housing, land distribution, and urban planning </st>
<p>
 
The scarcity of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../677/30677.xml">
tool</link>s, and building materials, and the cost of producing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/6670.xml">
cement</link> increased the pressure on already overcrowded housing.  Even before the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/261316.xml">
energy crisis</link>, extended families lived in small apartments (many of which were in very poor condition) to be closer to an urban area.  To help alleviate this situation, <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/5042481.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Government+and+politics%22])">
the government</link></country>
 engaged in land-distribution where they supplemented larger government owned <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/59790.xml">
farm</link>s with privately owned ones. Small homes were built in rural areas and land was provided to encourage families to move and assist in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/10646.xml">
food</link> production for themselves and to sell in local farmers' <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/3736784.xml">
market</link>s. As the film "The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil" discusses, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/89313.xml">
co-ops</link> were developed which were owned and managed by groups, as well as creating opportunities for allowing them to form "service co-ops" where credit was exchanged and group purchasing power was used to buy <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../694/37694.xml">
seed</link>s and other necessary items.</p>

Transportation</st>
<p>
 
Cubans were accustomed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/13673345.xml">
car</link>s as a convenient mode of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18580879.xml">
transportation</link>.  It was a difficult shift during the Special Period to adjust to a new way of managing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18580879.xml">
transportation</link> of thousands of people to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../022/28022.xml">
school</link>, to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../993/314993.xml">
work</link> and to other daily activities. With the realization that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/10646.xml">
food</link> was the key to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../699/1827699.xml">
survival</link>, transportation became a secondary worry and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/33509.xml">
walking</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/47761.xml">
hitch-hiking</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/383038.xml">
carpooling</link> became the norm. Privately owned <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../410/32410.xml">

.  Much of their land was so damaged (de-mineralized and almost sand-like) that it took three to five years of intensely "healing" the soil with amendments, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/5966.xml">
compost</link>, "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../255/409255.xml">

 survived this <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/492128.xml">
crisis</link> is the shift in their thinking from machine to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/19389176.xml">
manual labour</link> and other earth-friendly practices.  Abandoning their previous industrialized agricultural methods, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../692/152692.xml">
tractor</link>s and other machinery were replaced with human and animal labor.  Older farmers familiar with raising and training oxen trained others to increase those involved in food production. Chemical fertilizers were replaced with organic farming techniques which require more labor but less fossil fuels.  Initially, this was a very difficult situation for Cubans to accept; many came home from studying abroad to find that there were no jobs in their fields. It was pure survival that motivated them to continue and contribute to survive through this crisis. The documentary states that today, farmers make more money than most other occupations; without food, there is no life.</p>

Urban gardening</st>
<p>

Due to a poor economy, there were many crumbling buildings that could not be repaired. These were torn down and the empty lots lay idle for years until the food shortages forced Cuban citizens to make use of every piece of land.  Initially, this was an ad-hoc process where ordinary Cubans took the initiative to grow their own food in whatever piece of land was available. The government encouraged this practice and later assisted in promoting it. Organic urban gardens sprung up throughout the capital of Havana and other urban centers on roof-tops, patios, and unused parking lots in raised beds as well as "squatting" on empty lots. These efforts were furthered by Australian agriculturalists that came to the island in 1993 to teach <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/78214.xml">
permaculture</link>, a sustainable agricultural system, and to "train the trainers".  The Cuban government then sent these teams throughout the country to train others.</p>

Farmers' markets</st>
<p>

"Kiosks" (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../903/337903.xml">
farmers' market</link>s) were set up in all communities to provide easy access to locally grown produce; less travel time required less energy use.  These local markets provide 80-100% of the produce needed for that local community.</p>

Education and health</st>

In most countries, social programs are the first things to get cut during times of economic hardship.  Before the Special Period, <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 had three Universities and tuition costs were covered by the government.  During this <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/492128.xml">
crisis</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/9252.xml">
education</link> continued to be tuition-free and to assist in reducing the cost of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18580879.xml">

<p>

Cuba's focus on prevention and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../381/80381.xml">
health</link> has earned the small nation a world-wide reputation and teams of doctors have been sent throughout the globe to train and assist particularly during <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/58921.xml">

Solar and wind energy</st>
<p>

95% of the population was connected to the National Electric Grid.  With limited petroleum, blackouts lasting up to 16 hours became common.  To assist rural areas, 200 rural schools, as well as some residential properties, were provided with solar panels.  Use of wind-energy was also increased although the cost was also prohibitive at the time.</p>

Bio-energy</st>
<p>
 
One example of alternative thinking is the use of bio-energy.  Sugar mills served a dual purpose and became power plants that produced bio-energy from the waste products of the sugar cane.  30% of energy used in Cuba comes from bio-energy sources.</p>
<p>

As Cuba's economy improves, the government has plans to allocate more financial resources to invest in a more extensive use of alternative energy sources and fuels.</p>

Other effects</st>
<p>

The ideological changes of the Special Period had effects on Cuban society and culture, beyond those on the country. Geoffrey Baker argues that Cuban rap emerged as a result of the Special Period and its socioeconomic changes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> The increased responsibilities that Cuban women had within their families as a result of the economic effects also gave them more authority within Cuban society. In recent years, many Cuban women have chosen to enact this power and authority on the dance floor to the music of the pleasure and body-focused reggaeton genre, through highly controversial, explicitly sexual dance moves.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

Whereas reggaeton in Cuba emphasized dancing and the female body without any regard for lyrical content, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/864567.xml">
Cuban hip hop</link> evolved as a socially conscious movement influenced heavily by the effects of Cuba's conversion to a 'mixed economy' on the younger generation.  The arrival of rap in Cuba was very much shaped by this Special period.  The Revolution and the blockage of all imports from the USA, made the dissemination of American music difficult as it was often "tainted as music of the enemy and began to disappear from the public view." Because of this, hip hop circulated through informal networks, thus creating a huge underground scene of rap enthusiasts and eventually Cuban rappers. Eventually rap became nationalized by the government when it was understood as keeping with the goals of the Revolution.  This socialist ideology and economic situation in Cuba had a two-fold effect on rap: rap artists lyrics were primarily focused on temas sociales, or social issues, that provided critiques of complex issues while maintaining positive energy.  Secondly, because of the conversion of the US dollar and the historic marginalized position of rap in Cuba, rap artists are often poor despite their local popularity.  The lack of resources to purchase the electronic equipment to produce beats and tracks gives Cuban rap a raw feel that paralleled that of 'old school' music in the USA.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

After the Special Period</st>
<p>

As the country began to recover more visibly from the shock of the implosion of their economic underpinning, Castro gradually told the Cuban people that this "Special Period" was over; that it had succeeded in generally maintaining the long life expectancies and health statistics of the nation — figures roughly equivalent to those enjoyed in the United States — and that the country was therefore (relatively) prosperous once again.</p>
<p>

Cubans suffered a great deal during the decade referred to as the Special Period and are still living under a lower standard than they were before 1991.  This period forced Cuba to change from a nation of consumers--dependent on external oil sources--to a more sustainable economy based on meeting basic needs and conservation.  Despite the fact that Cuba is a poor country (the average annual gross domestic product is $3,500), and may not be viewed as “successful” by Western standards, the average life span is higher than in the U.S. and the infant mortality rate is only just lower than the US.  Their literacy rate is higher and their citizens have free medical and educational opportunities.  </p>
<p>

According to Roberto Perez from the Foundation for Nature and Humanity, it is the focus on the three “C’s”= Community, Conservation and Cooperation” that has been the key to Cuba’s survival during this crisis. He states that change and sacrifice has been based on what is good for the community and not based solely on needs of individuals.</p>
