<b>Oil analysis</b> (OA) is the sampling and laboratory analysis of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/18069.xml">
lubricant</link>'s properties, suspended contaminants, and anti-wear additives. <it>OA</it> is performed during routine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../576/41576.xml">
preventive maintenance</link> to provide meaningful and accurate information on lubricant and machine condition. By monitoring oil analysis sample results over the life of a particular machine, trends can be established which can help eliminate costly repairs. The study of wear in an engine is called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../228/489228.xml">
tribology</link>. Tribologists often perform or interpret oil analysis.<p>

OA can be divided into four categories:

OA was first used after <military_action wordnetid="100952963" confidence="0.8">

 by the US <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../715/25715.xml">
railroad industry</link> to monitor the health of locomotives. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../631/34631.xml">
1946</link> the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../417/982417.xml">
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad</link>'s research laboratory successfully detected <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/8540.xml">
diesel engine</link> problems through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/366023.xml">
wear</link> metal analysis of used oils. A key factor in their success was the development of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/29293.xml">
spectrograph</link>, an instrument which replaced several <link>
wet chemical</link> methods for detecting and measuring individual chemical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/9617.xml">
elements</link> such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/14734.xml">
iron</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/125293.xml">
copper</link>. This practice was soon accepted and used extensively throughout the railroad industry.</p>
<p>

By <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/34851.xml">
1955</link> OA had matured to the point that the United States <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../064/2588064.xml">
Bureau of Naval Weapons</link> began a major research program to adopt wear metal analysis for use in aircraft component failure prediction. These studies formed the basis for a <link>
Joint Oil Analysis Program</link> (JOAP) involving all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. The JOAP results proved conclusively that increases in component wear could be confirmed by detecting corresponding increases in the wear metal content of the lubricating oil. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../953/34953.xml">
1958</link> <link>
Pacific Intermountain Express</link> (P.I.E.) was the first trucking company to set up an in-house used oil analysis laboratory to control vehicle maintenance costs. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/34664.xml">
1960</link> the first independent commercial oil analysis laboratory was started by Edward Forgeron in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../548/50548.xml">
Oakland, CA</link>.</p>
<p>

Modern usage of OA includes the analysis of the additives in oils to determine if an extended drain interval may be used. Maintenance costs can be reduced if OA can determine if additives in the original oil are still present. By comparing the OA results of new and used oil, a tribologist can determine when an oil must be replaced. Careful analysis might even allow the oil to be "sweetened" to its original level of additives by either adding fresh oil or adding the pure additive that was depleted.</p>
