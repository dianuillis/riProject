<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/7279897.xml">
U.S. Department of Defense</link></agency>
. The SEI also works closely with industry and academia through research collaborations. <p>

Since 1984, the SEI has served as a global resource in software engineering, networked systems survivability, and process improvement. The SEI provides technical leadership to advance the practice of software engineering so that software-intensive systems can be acquired and sustained with predictable and improved cost, schedule, and quality. </p>
<p>

In recent years, software has continued to grow in importance and impact, not only in defense systems, but also in transportation, finance, medicine, entertainment, and all other aspects of everyday life. The SEI has contributed to this growth in many areas including software process improvement, network security and survivability, software architecture and software product lines, interoperability of systems, and the improvement of software acquisition skills. </p>
<p>

The SEI program of work is conducted in three principal areas: management practices, engineering practices, and acquisition practices. Within these broad areas of work, the SEI defines specific initiatives aimed at solving problems that impede the ability of organizations to acquire, build, and evolve software-intensive systems predictably, on time, within expected cost, with expected functionality, and without vulnerabilities. </p>

 Management practices</st>

<p>

Organizations need to effectively manage the acquisition, development, and evolution of software-intensive systems. Success in software engineering management practices helps organizations predict and control quality, schedule, cost, cycle time, and productivity. The best-known example of SEI work in management practices is the SEI’s <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

). The CMMI approach consists of models, appraisal methods, and training courses that have been proven to improve process performance. In 2006, Version 1.2 of the CMMI Product Suite included the release of CMMI for Development. CMMI for Development is the first of three constellations defined in Version 1.2: the others under development, to be released in 2007, include CMMI for Acquisition and CMMI for Services.  The CMMI for Services constallation has not yet been released, as of the fall of 2008.</p>

Engineering practices</st>
<p>

SEI work in engineering practices increases the ability of software engineers to analyze, predict, and control selected
functional and non-functional properties of software systems. Key SEI tools and methods include the SEI <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../944/1708944.xml">
Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method</link> (ATAM) methodology, the SEI Framework for Software Product Line Practice, and the SEI Service Migration and Reuse Technique (SMART).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Acquisition practices</st>
<p>

Acquiring software-intensive systems that work on their first promised date is a global imperative. The goal of SEI work in acquisition support is to help acquisition organizations improve their processes and minimize their risks.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Security</st>

<p>

The SEI is also the home of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../854/5328854.xml">
CERT/CC</link> (CERT Coordination Center), the federally funded computer security organization. The SEI CERT Program's primary goals are to ensure that appropriate technology and systems-management practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services in spite of successful attacks, accidents, or failures. The SEI CERT program is working with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../446/1289446.xml">
US-CERT</link> to produce the Build Security In Web site, which provides a wealth of knowledge and practices gained from SEI research and collaborations. The SEI has also conducted research on insider threats and computer forensics. Results of this research and other information now populate the CERT Virtual Training Environment. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
SEI Partner Network</st>
<p>

The SEI Partner Network helps the SEI disseminate software engineering best practices. Organizations and individuals in the SEI Partner Network are selected, trained, and licensed by the SEI to deliver authentic SEI services, which include courses, consulting methods, and management processes.  The network currently consists of nearly 250 partner organizations worldwide.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Conferences</st>
<p>

The SEI sponsors national and international conferences, workshops, and user-group meetings. The largest of these, the Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG) conference, is the world’s leading annual conference and exhibit showcase for process improvement.  Other events cover subjects including acquisition of software-intensive systems, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/2425273.xml">
commercial off-the-shelf</link> (COTS)-based systems, network security and survivability, software process research, software product lines, CMMI, and the SEI Team Software Process.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Education and training</st>
<p>

SEI courses help bring state-of-the-art technologies and practices from research and development into widespread use.  SEI courses are currently offered at the SEI’s locations in the United States and Europe. In addition, using licensed course materials, SEI Partners train thousands of individuals annually.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Membership program</st>
<p>

The SEI Membership Program provides leaders in the software engineering community the opportunity to learn, network, and advance through collaboration with the SEI and each other. Currently, there are more than 2,000 SEI Members around the world.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Affiliate program</st>
<p>

Through the SEI Affiliate Program, organizations place technical experts with the SEI for periods ranging from six months to four years. Affiliates currently are working on projects with the SEI to identify, develop, and demonstrate improved software engineering practices.</p>
