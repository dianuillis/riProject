Recently he played a founding role in the launching of two networking companies through the high-tech incubator Leading Edge Networks Inc., which he ran in the early 2000s: Global Wireless Services, a provider of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/147184.xml">
broadband</link> hotspot mobile Internet and hotspot VoIP services to high-end marinas; and, InfoPort Communications Group, an optical and Gigabit Ethernet metropolitan carrier supporting Data Center/SAN/channel extension and Grid Computing network access services (2001-2003).  </p>

Minoli has worked extensively in the field of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/185868.xml">
wireless</link>.  His work in wireless started in the mid-1970s with extensive efforts on ARPA-sponsored research on wireless packet networks.  In the early 1980s he was involved in the design of high-resilience radio networks.  In the mid-1980s he was involved in designing and deploying <link>
VSAT</link> networks, including work on correlated traffic profiles.  Recently he has been involved with the novel design for Wi-Fi hotspot networks for interference-laden public places such as marinas, and has written the first book on the market on hotspot networking, Hotspot Networks – WiFi for Public Access Locations (McGraw-Hill, 2003).  He has also been involved with the planning and deployment of high-density enterprise IEEE 802.11b/g/e/i systems and VoWi-Fi.  He recently also acted as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/10115.xml">
expert witness</link> for the winning party in a US$11,000 million lawsuit regarding a wireless Air-to-Ground communication system for airplane-based telephony and information services.  He has also done work on wireless networking applications of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/21488.xml">
nanotechnology</link> (Quantum Cascade Lasers for Free Space Optics), and has just published a book on that topic with Wiley (2005).  </p>
<p>

Minoli is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../914/914.xml">
author</link> of a number of books (44) on Information Technology, telecommunications, and data communications.  He has also written columns for <it>ComputerWorld</it>, <it>NetworkWorld</it>, and <it>Network Computing</it> (1985-1995).  He has spoken at 77 industry conferences and he has taught at <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 (1984-2003).  Also, he was a Technology Analyst At-Large for Gartner/DataPro (1985-2001).  On their behalf, based on extensive hand-on work at financial firms and carriers, he tracked technologies and authored numerous CTO/CIO-level technical/architectural scans in the area of telephony and data communications systems, including topics on security, disaster recovery, IT outsourcing, network management, LANs, WANs (ATM and MPLS), wireless (LAN and public hotspot), VoIP, network design/economics, carrier networks (such as metro Ethernet and CWDM/DWDM), and e-commerce.  Over the years he has advised venture capitalists for investments of US$150M in a dozen high-tech companies.</p>
