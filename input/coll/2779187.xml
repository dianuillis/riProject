A sample network diagram
</caption>

A <b>computer network diagram</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/41679.xml">
schematic</link> depicting the nodes and connections amongst nodes in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/4122592.xml">
computer network</link> or, more generally, any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/46545.xml">
telecommunications network</link>.

Readily identifiable icons are used to depict common network appliances e.g. Router, and the style of lines between them indicate the type of connection.  Clouds are used to represent networks external to the one pictured for the purposes of depicting connections between internal and external devices, without indicating the specifics of the outside network.  For example, in the hypothetical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/17739.xml">
local area network</link> pictured to the right, three <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/18457137.xml">
personal computer</link>s and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/42116.xml">
server</link> are connected to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../614/40614.xml">
switch</link>; the server is further connected to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../272/5272.xml">
printer</link> and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/25748.xml">
gateway router</link>, which is connected via a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/38140.xml">
WAN link</link> to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>.</p>
<p>

Depending on whether the diagram is intended for formal or informal use, certain details may be lacking and must be determined from context.  For example, the sample diagram does not indicate the physical type of connection between the PCs and the switch, but since a modern LAN is depicted, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../499/9499.xml">
Ethernet</link> may be assumed.  If the same style of line was used in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/38140.xml">
WAN</link>(wide area network) diagram, however, it may indicate a different physical connection.</p>
<p>

At different scales, diagrams may represent various levels of network granularity.  At the LAN level, individual nodes may represent individual physical devices, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../926/1937926.xml">
hubs</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../151/41151.xml">
file server</link>s, while at the WAN level, individual nodes may represent entire cities.  In addition, when the scope of a diagram crosses the common LAN/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../326/43326.xml">
MAN</link>/<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.imdedicated.com/files/33.jpg">
WAN</weblink> boundaries, representative hypothetical devices may be depicted instead of showing all actually existing nodes.  For example, if a network appliance is intended to be connected through the Internet to many end-user mobile devices, only a single such device may be depicted for the purposes of showing the general relationship between the appliance and any such device.</p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/51746.xml">
Cisco</link> uses its own brand of networking symbols. Since Cisco has a large Internet presence and designs a broad variety of network devices, its list of symbols is exhaustive.  As of November 28, 2006 this list can be found at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac50/ac47/2.html.</p>

The <it>physical</it> network topology can be directly represented in a network diagram, as it is simply the physical <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/325806.xml">
graph (mathematics)</link> represented by the diagrams, with network nodes as vertices and connections as undirected or direct edges (depending on the type of connection).  The <it>logical</it> network topology can be inferred from the network diagram if details of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/83235.xml">
network protocols</link> in use are also given.</p>
