an inventor, that was reported to be able to analyze the composition of the ground remotely, to depths of up to 50 meters. It is widely believed by the scientific community to be a fraud, however there has not hitherto been a through independent investigation to prove such claims.

How it works</st>

<p>

Salinas has said that his machine works by searching for materials based on their atomic composition. By programming it with 1,500 different atomic profiles, the machine is able to send out a signal and then receive it back once it find the searched-for elements. Then it uses an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link> to analyze the elements that have been detected.</p>
<p>

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/22530.xml">
October 12</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/35984.xml">
2005</link> at a presentation at the <link>
Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María</link> in <link>
Valparaíso</link>, Salinas gave fantastic and seemingly irrational theories to explain how his machine worked. Before an audience of students, physicists and engineers he offered the following explanations:</p>
<p>

"We isolate an atom, and put it inside a vacuum chamber, that means absolute zero atmosphere and gravity. Then we irradiate it and wait for it to decant. Then we spin that atom backwards over its own axis and that irradiates the profile that we store."</p>

Findings</st>

<p>

TR Araña was credited for having uncovering an elusive weapons cache at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../846/526846.xml">
Colonia Dignidad</link> (guns and rocket launchers buried 10 meters down), and then for locating the body of Luis Francisco Yuraszeck, a Chilean businessman who had been missing since March 2004, and whose body was buried under four meters of cement. However, international attention came in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/35984.xml">
2005</link> after Wagner Technologies, the funding company behind the development of Salinas's invention, claimed to have used it to find the largest recorded <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../880/146880.xml">
treasure</link> trove: roughly 600 barrels of gold coins and jewels, worth about $10 billion, buried 15 meters beneath the surface of <land wordnetid="109334396" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../371/1454371.xml">

 in the Chilean archipelago of <link>
Juan Fernández</link>. The treasure had been seized from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../708/664708.xml">
Inca</link> by Spanish <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/303159.xml">

1715</link> by <link>
Juan Esteban Ubilla y Echeverría</link>. Because of its value, it had for centuries attracted unsuccessful treasure hunters to the island (which was also the site of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/272778.xml">

 novel). When Chilean authorities claimed the reported treasure as government property, a standoff developed. Wagner Technologies said it would disclose the treasure's precise coordinates only when the government renounced its claim and that it would also donate 60 percent of it to Chilean charities. The government did not back down, and the supposed treasure remains in dispute and unexcavated.</p>

Criticism</st>

<p>

Consensus exists among scientists that the technology said by Salinas to be used on the robot — bouncing a nuclear signal off materials to search for specific atomic compositions — works, but only to depths of 30 centimeters. Anything beyond that distance, like the dozens of meters the machine's inventor claims to be able to probe, would be today considered a technological advance.</p>
<p>

Salinas has refused to patent the machine, saying the technology is "an industrial secret."</p>
