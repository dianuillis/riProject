<p>

 History </st>

<p>

Krašići was located at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/37754.xml">
mountain</link> side, a few kilometers from its present location.
This place is now called <it>Gornji Krašići</it> (Upper Krašići) or <it>Stari Krašići</it> (Old Krašići) and current village is sometimes called <it>Donji Krašići</it> (Lower Krašići).</p>
<p>

The village <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/247010.xml">
graveyard</link> is still located in the old village.  Villagers lived mostly from planting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
olive</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../607/66607.xml">
vine</link>s and producing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/32961.xml">
wine</link>.</p>
<p>

After the great <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/18893748.xml">
1979 Montenegro earthquake</link>, the village was heavily damaged and people have resettled on the current location at sea shore, which was prior to the earthquake used for small-scale <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/36581.xml">
fishing</link>.  In addition to their former occupations, they increased fishing, and, recently, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/29789.xml">
tourism</link>.</p>
<p>

In the 1970s, some tourists started building houses around the village in larger numbers.
This boomed and now they by far outnumber locals.  The first tourist settlement is <it>Krašići 1</it>; after it, <it>Krašići 2</it> was built.  Tourists have also built the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../630/40630.xml">
beach</link> (which was a stony beach before that), streets and infrastructure in the settlement.  Currently it has <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../3$00/Radeon_R$300.xml">
electricity</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../003/30003.xml">
telephone</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../160/19725160.xml">
sewage</link>, but no <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>; individual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/19009110.xml">
rainwater</link> tanks are used as technical water and drinking water has to be bought.  It is not quite correct, Krasici has random water supply.</p>
<p>

Houses in Krašići 1 and 2 are self-built by tourists; but after noticing the popularity of this location, the construction company <it>Šumadija</it> built a planned settlement in 1980 which is now called <it>Krašići 2/2</it> (former Krašići 2 is now called <it>Krašići 2/1</it>) or sometimes <it>Krašići - Šumadija</it> or <it>Krašići - Maslinjak</it> (<it>Maslinjak</it> - <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
olive</link> plantation; because it is built in place of one).  After that some people have self-built houses in <it>Krašići 3</it>.</p>

<p>

Original Krašići has some 15 houses; now, in addition to that, there are several small <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/14276.xml">
hotel</link>s held by locals.  Krašići 2/1 has around 80 houses.</p>
