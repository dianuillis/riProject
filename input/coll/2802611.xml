<p>

Mr. Sandy K. Chandra, also affectionately called Sandy, is the Chairman and CEO of (MGL) Mascon

In 1981, he also became one of the founding investors of MGL and became responsible for shifting the company's focus towards the

With a penchant for the finer things crafted by skilled hands, Mr. Chandra is also an avid art collector. Widely traveled across the globe, he spends his time, shuttling between his India office and his offices spread across geographies. </p>
