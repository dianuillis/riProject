<b>Vote pairing</b> (or vote swapping, as it has also been called) is the method where a voter in one district agrees to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../332/30332.xml">
vote tactically</link> for a less-preferred candidate or party who has a greater chance of winning in their district, in exchange for a voter from another district voting tactically for the candidate the first voter prefers, because that candidate has a greater possibility of winning in that district.</p>
<p>

This occurs informally (i.e., without binding contracts) but sometimes with great sophistication in the United States, United Kingdom and other places.  </p>
<p>

Using UK elections as an example, tactical voting is often between <link>
the Labour Party</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../007/18933007.xml">
Liberal Democrats</link>. There may be one constituency in which the Labour Party and the <party wordnetid="108256968" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../113/32113.xml">
Conservative Party</link></party>
 candidates are running in a tight race, with the Liberal Democrat far behind. In another constituency, the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates may be in a tight race, with the Labour candidate far behind. A Liberal Democrat voter in the first constituency would agree to vote for the Labour candidate in exchange for a Labour voter from the second constituency voting for the Liberal Democrat candidate.</p>
<p>

Tactical voting has been used since 2000 as a strategy for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../332/19681332.xml">

 Change in terminology from "vote swapping" in 2000 to "vote pairing" by 2004 </st>
<p>

Through the <election wordnetid="100181781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/32009.xml">
2000 election</link></election>
, the concept was known in the US as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/280502.xml">
vote swapping</link>," while "vote pairing" originally had a somewhat different meaning--where people of opposing parties would agree to together vote for a third-party candidate instead of for their own candidates.  (For example, a disaffected Democrat and a disaffected Republican both agreeing to vote for a third party candidate instead of for the candidates of their own parties.)  However, by the <election wordnetid="100181781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

2004 presidential election</link></election>
 "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/280502.xml">
vote swapping</link>" had become "vote pairing," and the various people who had created <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/280502.xml">
vote swapping</link> sites for the <election wordnetid="100181781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 Vulnerable to manipulation or electoral sabotage? </st>
<p>

The concern often gets raised on whether vote pairing can be used by opposing parties to manipulate an election or sabotage a candidate. However, in practice, such ideas of manipulation turn out to be impractical and self defeating.  </p>
<p>

Ultimately the only real way to manipulate vote pairing, and its effect on an election outcome, is to prevent people from learning about it, not to pose as a different kind of voter.

 Legality of vote pairing questioned </st>
<p>

In the United States (and perhaps elsewhere), the legality of vote pairing in public elections has been questioned. Opponents claim that it is illegal to give or accept anything that has pecuniary value in exchange for a vote.  (Indeed efforts to buy or sell votes are illegal, and in the <election wordnetid="100181781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/32009.xml">
2000 presidential election</link></election>
, there was even a web site for buying and selling votes, vote-auction.com, which was shut down by an Illinois judge. See link at bottom.)  Proponents for vote pairing respond that vote pairing doesn't involve any pecuniary or monetary exchange; rather, simply informal, nonbinding agreements between people to vote strategically. Also, vote pairing is a routine practice in legislative bodies, city councils, etc. See the next section on the issue of legality in the <election wordnetid="100181781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

  The issue of the legality of vote pairing and the United States presidential election, 2000 </st>
<p>

It can be argued that the charge that vote pairing was illegal in the US was itself politically manipulative, rather than an authentic legal question. The debate peaked during the 2000 presidential election, when there was a strong effort to shut down the US vote-pairing web sites. However, the federal <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

</gathering>
</assembly>
</social_group>
 eventually ruled against this action (see bottom for a link to the decision), and by the 2004 presidential election there was no such effort to shut down vote pairing.</p>
<p>

The debate intensified in the final days of the 2000 election when six Republican state secretaries of state, led by the California state secretary of state, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../227/839227.xml">
Bill Jones</link>, charged that vote-pairing web sites were illegal and threatened criminal charges against their creators. Multiple web sites had sprung up that were matching supporters of the Democratic presidential candidate, <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

There are multiple reasons it would be important for Ralph Nader to still get his share of the national popular vote. One is that if he got five percent or more, then he could get federally distributed public funding in the next election. Also, and perhaps more importantly, he could possibly get included in the <group_action wordnetid="101080366" confidence="0.8">

<p>

In 2000, many of the vote pairing web sites were hosted in California, and so when the California state secretary of state, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../227/839227.xml">
Bill Jones</link>, charged that the web sites were illegal and threatened their creators with criminal prosecution, some of the sites reluctantly shut down. The <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/1950.xml">
American Civil Liberties Union</link></organization>
 (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/1950.xml">
ACLU</link>) got involved to protect the web sites, seeking a restraining order against Jones and then a permanent injunction against him, alleging that he had violated the constitutional rights of the web site creators (see the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/1950.xml">
ACLU</link> news release at bottom). However, the issue would only be resolved after the 2000 election had already occurred. Not all of the vote pairing web sites shut down in the 2000 election, but the rumor started to spread that the web sites were illegal, and arguably this discouraged more people from going to the remaining web sites. The media at the time gave little coverage to vote pairing, except for how it was being charged as illegal.</p>
<p>

It is possible that Jones's threats of criminal charges against the creators of the vote-pair web sites changed the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. One of the web sites, votetrader.org, tallied the number of people that had registered to pair their votes on all the vote-pairing web sites. They tallied that 1,412 Nader supporters in Florida had gotten matched with Gore supporters from Republican states (although more likely vote paired with relatives and friends in other states--instead of over the Internet).  <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 would eventually rule against him, but this decision did not come down until <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../021/11021.xml">
February 6</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/36163.xml">
2003</link>, long after the 2000 election was already over (see bottom for a link to the decision--although note that the decision has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit). In the next presidential election, in 2004, the legality of the votepairing web sites went unquestioned. Indeed, the California state secretary of state for the 2004 election (a successor to Bill Jones) publicly announced, before that election, that vote pairing was legal.  </p>
<p>

A central question is whether <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../227/839227.xml">
Bill Jones</link> knew that the outcome of the federal Ninth Circuit decision would vindicate the vote pairing web sites. It can be argued that he should have known this, because strategic vote pairing was already common on city councils, in the US Congress, in other legislative bodies, etc., and does not involve actually buying or selling votes. If he did know, then arguably he challenged the legality of the vote pairing web sites and threatened criminal prosecution in order to manipulate the election unfairly.</p>

 Alternatives to vote pairing in single-winner elections: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/15011.xml">
instant-runoff voting</link>, or ranked-choice voting, and approval voting </st>
<p>
   
Vote pairing is a voter strategy for single-winner elections, but it is made moot by the election system of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/15011.xml">
instant-runoff voting</link>, or ranked choice voting. Vote pairing allows a person to electorally support a candidate that is unlikely to win an election, without inadvertently preventing the election of another candidate that they would otherwise prefer. <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">
<artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<instrumentality wordnetid="103575240" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/15011.xml">

</artifact>
</system>
 addresses this same problem within an official voting system. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/15011.xml">
instant-runoff voting</link>, voters rank their choices. A computer runs through everyone's first choices and then the candidate that comes in last gets taken out. The votes of everyone who voted for that candidate then get redistributed to their second-choice candidates and the computer runs through everyone's new top choices again. The process repeats until there's only one candidate left. Advocates of vote pairing tend to simultaneously advocate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/15011.xml">
instant-runoff voting</link> in election reform.   </p>
<p>

Another alternative is approval voting, which doesn't use a rank ballot. In approval voting, voters vote for as many candidates as they approve of. The total number of approval votes can greatly exceed the number of voters, but the candidate with the most approval votes wins.</p>
