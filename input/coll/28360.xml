He and Delmont divorced in 1940 mainly as a result of James's many relationships with other women; it was a pattern that continued throughout his life. In 1943, he married a dancer, Meg Sergei, née Williams (born 1913). They divorced on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/1490.xml">

During the later part of their marriage they lived in a house partly designed by James himself called Delaford Park situated in Iver, Buckinghmshire., a location close enough to Pinewood Studios to allow him to return home for lunch whilst filming.

It was intended that Ray would become a recurring <it>Carry On</it> star, but he had been dropped after just one film due to a contractual issues (he was contracted to ABC films who had never used him).

The characters he portrayed in the films were usually very similar to the wise-cracking, sly, lecherous cockney he was famed for playing on television, and often had the name Sid or Sidney.</p>
