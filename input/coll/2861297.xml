: شنكليش or شنغليش), also known as  <b>shinklish</b>, <b>shankleesh</b>, <b>sorke</b>, or <b>surke</b>, is a type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/5307.xml">

. It is typically formed into balls of approximately 6 cm diameter, which are often covered in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/1584445.xml">
zaatar</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../188/8250188.xml">
Aleppo pepper</link>, and then aged and dried. The most common spice is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../968/29968.xml">
thyme</link>, thus giving the cheese its appearance somewhat resembling a dirty <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../192/1577192.xml">
tennis ball</link>. Shanklish is also sold in much smaller balls or unformed.  <p>

Shanklish varies greatly in its texture and flavour. Fresh cheeses have a soft texture and mild flavour; those dried and aged for a longer period become progressively harder and can acquire an extremely pungent odour and flavour. To make spicier cheeses, spices such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../674/68674.xml">
aniseed</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../344/1067344.xml">
chilli</link> can be mixed in before the cheese is formed into balls. Spicy shanklish are often covered in chilli, especially in Syria, and thus appear red. Shanklish from the Syrian coastal plain around <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/879212.xml">
Tartous</link> and the adjoining northern Lebanese region of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/8380785.xml">
Akkar</link> are considered particularly delectable; these tend to be hard, with a clean strong flavour and near-white colour.</p>
<p>

Shanklish is generally eaten with finely-chopped <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/9940234.xml">
tomato</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/51258.xml">
onion</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>; and often accompanied by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/590260.xml">
araq</link>. It is a common <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/351015.xml">
mezze</link> dish. Shanklish is also mashed up with eggs or crushed in a pita with cucumbers, mint, and olive oil for breakfast.</p>
