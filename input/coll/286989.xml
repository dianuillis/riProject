It is tasked with providing "weather, hydrologic, and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy." This is done through a collection of national and regional centers, and more than 122 local weather forecast offices (WFOs). Since the NWS is a government agency, most of its products are in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/581195.xml">

. The mission of the NWS was "to provide for taking meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the States and Territories...and for giving notice on the northern (Great) Lakes and on the seacoast by magnetic telegraph and marine signals, of the approach and force of storms."

The NWS issues a comprehensive package of forecast products to support a variety of users, including the general public. Although text forecasts have been the primary means of product dissemination, the NWS has been converting its forecast products to a digital, gridded format. Each of the 122 Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) send their graphical forecasts to a national server to be compiled in the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD). This is a collection of sensible weather elements such as: maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, cloud cover, probability of precipitation, amount of precipitation and wintry precipitation, weather type, and wind direction and speed. In addition to viewing (<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/graphical/">
http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/graphical/</weblink>) gridded weather data via the internet, more advanced users can decode the individual grids using a "GRIB2 decoder" which can output data as shapefiles, netCDF, GrADS, float files, and comma separated variable files.  Specific points in the digital database can be accessed using an XML <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/29215.xml">
SOAP</link> service (<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.weather.gov/xml/">
http://www.weather.gov/xml/</weblink>). These capabilities have greatly increased the audience of NDFD data. The NWS has received some criticism from commercial weather vendors for providing graphical forecast data free of charge. They argue that such tailored forecast information compete with their own products. However, a large majority of private weather firms quickly realized its potential benefits and have flourished by using the NDFD as a tool for composing their products.</p>

The NWS supports the aviation community through the production of several specific forecast products. Each WFO has responsibility for the issuance of Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF) for one or more airports in their jurisdiction. TAFs are concise, coded 24-hour forecasts for a specific airport, issued every six hours with amendments as needed. As opposed to a public weather forecast, a TAF only addresses weather elements critical to aviation. These are: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/15440316.xml">
wind</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../418/1796418.xml">

. Their main responsibility is to provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the Traffic Management Units and control room supervisors. Special emphasis is given to weather conditions that would be hazardous to aviation or would impede the flow of air traffic in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../047/13869047.xml">

Fire Weather</st>
<p>

Catering to national, regional and local land management agencies such as the <link>
US Forest Service</link>, the NWS issues a complete Fire Weather Forecast twice daily, with updates as needed. The forecast contains weather information relevant to fire control and smoke management for the next 36-48 hours. The appropriate crews use this information to plan for staffing and equipment levels, the ability to do prescribed burns, and assess the daily fire danger. Once per day, NWS meteorologists issue a coded fire weather forecast for specific USFS observation sites that are then input into the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/12874176.xml">
National Fire Danger Rating System</link> (NFDRS). This computer model outputs the daily fire danger that is then conveyed to the public in one of four ratings: low, moderate, high, extreme.</p>
<p>

The local weather office also, under a prescribed set of criteria, will determine if a Fire Weather Watch or a Red Flag Warning needs to be issued. These products alert not only the public, but other agencies that conditions are creating the potential for extreme fire behavior.</p>
<p>

On the national level, the NWS <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/536249.xml">
Storm Prediction Center</link> issues fire weather analyses for days one and two. These include large-scale areas that may experience critical fire weather conditions including the occurrence of "dry thunderstorms." These are thunderstorms, usually occurring in the western U.S., that are not accompanied by any rain due to it evaporating before reaching the surface.
<image location="right" width="135px" src="NWS-IMET-deployed.jpg" type="thumb">

</image>

State and Federal forestry officials sometimes request a forecast from a WFO for a specific location called a "spot forecast." Spot forecasts are used to determine whether it will be safe to ignite a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../992/616992.xml">
prescribed burn</link> and how to situate crews during the controlling phase. Officials send in a request, usually during the early morning, containing the position coordinates of the proposed burn, the ignition time, and other pertinent information. The WFO composes a short-term fire weather forecast for the location and sends it back to the officials, usually within an hour of receiving the request.</p>
<p>

The NWS assists officials at large wildfires or other disasters, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/1476975.xml">
HAZMAT</link> incidents, by providing on-ground support through Incident Meteorologists (IMET). IMETs are NWS forecasters specially trained to work with Incident Management Teams during severe wildfire outbreaks or other disasters requiring onsite weather support. IMETs travel quickly to the incident site and then assemble a mobile weather center capable of providing continuous meteorological support for the duration of the incident. The kit includes a cell phone, a laptop computer and communications equipment, used for gathering and displaying weather data such as satellite imagery or numerical forecast model output. Remote weather stations are also used to gather specific data for the point of interest. They often receive direct support from the local WFO during such crises. IMETS can be deployed anywhere a disaster strikes and must be capable of working long hours for weeks at a time in remote locations under rough conditions. There are approximately 60 to 70 IMETs nationally.</p>

A significant portion of NWS forecasting is directed toward the general public. Because coded products are very difficult to understand by someone not familiar with the coding, most NWS public products are written using basic meteorological terminology in a sentence format. The main public forecasts products are:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Zone Forecast Product (ZFP) - text product issued by all WFOs to explicitly state expected weather conditions within each zone in their area of forecast responsibility through day seven.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Surf Zone Forecast (SRF) - a text forecast for local beaches issued by coastal WFOs, including coastal hazard information such as that pertaining to rip currents. These products are issued year-round at the Los Angeles, San Diego, and New York City offices, and seasonally at most other coastal offices.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Short Term Forecast (NOW) - a localized, event-driven product used to provide the public with detailed weather information during significant and/or fast-changing hydrometeorological conditions during the next six hours.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Area Forecast Matrices (AFM) - displays various weather parameters at 3, 6 and 12 hour intervals for areas specified in the current ZFP.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Point Forecast Matrices (PFM) - displays various weather parameters at 3, 6 and 12 hour intervals for significant cities in the WFO area of responsibility.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Tabular State Forecast Product (SFT) - general seven-day public forecast of hydrometeorological conditions at specific locations over a WFO's area of responsibility.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) - a semi-technical product primarily for explaining the scientific rationale behind a forecast and to summarize current watches/warnings/advisories in effect.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

NWS forecasts are available from their website. Previously, upon clicking a location on the map, the zone forecast for that county would appear. Now that the National Digital Forecast Database is operational, the internet forecasts have become "point-and-click," with the web server instantly composing a narrative text forecast for a particular point on the grid. This capability greatly reduces discontinuities in the forecast and takes full advantage of the detail put into the forecast by NWS meteorologists.</p>

</ss1>

Hydrologic</st>

<p>

The NWS is the primary source for hydrologic watches, warnings, and advisories for the United States of America. Local NWS offices are responsible for issuing: Flood Watches, Flash Flood Watches, Flood Warnings, Flash Flood Warnings and Flood Advisories for their local County Warning Area. These products can and do emphasize different hydrologic issues depending on geographic area, land use, time of year, as well as other meteorological and non-meteorological factors. For example, during the early spring or late winter a Flood Warning can be issued for an ice jam that occurs on a river, while in the summer a Flood Warning will most likely be issued for excessive rainfall. For the official definition of all the NWS hydrology products, see the NWS <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/">
glossary</weblink>.</p>
<p>

<p>

In recent years the NWS has enhanced its dissemination of hydrologic information through the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.weather.gov/ahps/">
Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service</weblink>, more commonly referred to by the acronym (AHPS).  AHPS allows anyone to view near real time observation and forecast data for rivers, lakes and streams. AHPS also enables the NWS to provide long-range probabilistic information which can be used for long-range planning decisions.</p>
<p>

Daily river forecasts are issued by the 13 River Forecast Centers (RFC) using hydrologic models based on rainfall, soil characteristics, precipitation forecasts, and several other variables. Some RFCs, especially those in mountainous regions, also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts.  These forecasts are used by a wide range of users, including those in agriculture, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/381399.xml">

Additionally, Weather Forecast Offices issue daily and monthly climate reports for their area of responsibility.  These generally include recorded highs, lows and other information.  Since this data is not official until it has been quality controlled by NCDC, when these products are made available from Forecast Offices (<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.weather.gov/climate/">

Automated Surface Observing System</link></datum>
</information>
 (ASOS)</it> is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). The ASOS serves as the nation's primary surface weather observing network. It is designed to support weather forecast activities and aviation operations and, at the same time, support the needs of the meteorological, hydrological, and climatological research communities. ASOS was especially designed for the safety of the aviation community, therefore the sites are almost always located near airport runways. The system transmits routine hourly observations along with special observations when conditions exceed preselected weather element thresholds (e.g. the visibility decreases to less than 3 miles). The basic weather elements observed are: sky condition, visibility, present weather, obstructions to vision, pressure, temperature, dewpoint, wind direction and speed, precipitation accumulation, and selected significant remarks. The coded observations are issued as <information wordnetid="105816287" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Getting more information on the atmosphere, more frequently, and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings. Due to the large installation and operating costs associated with ASOS, the stations are widely spaced. Before aviation weather observing began, the <it>Cooperative Observer Program (COOP)</it> was the only means for acquiring daily weather information. This network of approximately 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers still flourishes today, providing much of the meteorological and climatological data to the country. The program which was established in 1890 under the Organic Act, currently has a twofold mission:

NWS forecasters need frequent, high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced. These observations are especially critical to the output of <occupation wordnetid="100582388" confidence="0.8">

 because large water bodies have a profound impact on the weather. Other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities. To help meet these needs, the NWS's <institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../703/5000703.xml">
National Data Buoy Center</link></institution>
 (NDBC) operates a network of about 90 buoys and 60 land-based coastal observing systems (C-MAN). All stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. All stations report hourly.</p>
<p>

Supplemental weather observations are acquired through the <it>United States Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS)</it> program. It is organized for the purpose of obtaining weather and oceanographic observations from transiting ships. An international program under World Meteorological Organization (WMO) marine auspices, the VOS has forty-nine countries as participants. The United States program is the largest in the world, with nearly 1,000 vessels. Observations are taken by deck officers, coded in a special format known as the "ships synoptic code", and transmitted in realtime to the NWS. They are then distributed on national and international circuits for use by meteorologists in weather forecasting, by oceanographers, ship routing services, fishermen, and many others. The observations are then forwarded for use by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina.</p>

Upper air weather data is essential for weather forecasting and research. The NWS operates 92 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/172851.xml">
radiosonde</link> locations in North America and 10 sites in the Caribbean. A small, expendable instrument package is suspended below a 2 meter (6 ft) wide balloon filled with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../255/13255.xml">
hydrogen</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/13256.xml">
helium</link>, then released daily at or shortly after 11 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/143276.xml">
UTC</link> and 23 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/143276.xml">
UTC</link>. As the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters/minute (1,000 ft/min), sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. These sensors are linked to a battery powered radio transmitter that sends the sensor measurements to a ground receiver. By tracking the position of the radiosonde in flight, information on wind speed and direction aloft is also obtained. The flight can last longer than two hours, and during this time the radiosonde can ascend above 35 km (115,000 ft) and drift more than 200 km (125 mi) from the release point. When the balloon has expanded beyond its elastic limit and bursts (about 6 m or 20 ft in diameter), a small parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde, minimizing the danger to lives and property.</p>
<p>

Data obtained during the flights is coded and disseminated, at which point it can be plotted on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/1268839.xml">
Skew-T</link> or Stuve diagram for analysis.</p>
<p>

In recent years, the National Weather Service has begun incorporating data from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/6158574.xml">
AMDAR</link> in its numerical models (however, the raw data is not available to the public).</p>

The National Weather Service has developed a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of hazardous weather. These are:</p>
<p>

<b>Outlook</b> - A hazardous weather outlook is issued daily addressing potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur in the next seven days. The outlook will include information about potential severe thunderstorms, heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, extremes of heat or cold, etc. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Severe Weather Outlook.</p>
<p>

<b>Watch</b> - A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible, but not imminent. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.</p>
<p>

<b>Warning</b> - A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.</p>
<p>

<b>Advisory</b> - An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. Advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings, that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life or property.</p>
<p>

<b>Special Weather Statement</b> - A special weather statement is issued when something rare or unusual is occurring. These are usually triggered by sudden changes in meteorological conditions. The statements are to be taken as warnings for residents of a specific area. The warning generally states that an area might be at risk for a slight weather danger. Not all weather statements are warnings, though. Other times, statements describe informative facts about a weather system; such as local snowfall.</p>

The <it>Weather.gov</it> website is a data rich website operated by NWS that serves as a portal to hundreds of thousands of webpages and more than 300 different NWS websites.  From the homepage, it is possible to enter a city and state to get a local forecast page, view a rapidly updated map of active watch and warnings, and select areas related to graphical forecasts, national maps, radar displays, rivers, air quality, satellite images and climate.  Also offered are xml data feeds of active watch and warnings, ASOS observations and digital forecasts for 5x5 kilometer grids.</p>
<p>

The <it>Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN)</it> is an internet site operated by the NWS that has been superseded by the <it>weather.gov</it> and has recently been proposed for termination. </p>
<p>

Since 1983, the NWS has provided external user access to U.S. Government obtained or derived weather information through a collection of data communication line services called the <it>Family of Services (FOS)</it>. FOS is accessible via dedicated telecommunications access lines in the Washington, D.C., area. All FOS data services are driven by the NWS Telecommunication Gateway computer systems located at NWS headquarters in Silver Spring, MD. Users may obtain any of the individual services from NWS for a one-time connection charge and an annual user fee.</p>

Controversy</st>

<p>

While generally respected as one of the premier weather organizations in the United States, the National Weather Service has been perceived by some, particularly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../498/3225498.xml">
libertarian</link>s and commercial weather services such as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/652031.xml">
AccuWeather</link></company>
, as competing unfairly with the private sector. In 2005, Senator <senator wordnetid="110578471" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/214873.xml">
Rick Santorum</link></senator>
 (R-PA) introduced the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/5026496.xml">
National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005</link>, a bill intended to limit the NWS's ability to provide data that could be given just as easily by commercial outlets, but at a cost. The bill was widely criticized by users of the NWS's services. The bill died in committee during the 2005 session.</p>
