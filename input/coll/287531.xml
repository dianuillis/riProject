In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../957/18957.xml">
medicine</link>, <b>gallstones</b> (choleliths) are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/6015.xml">
crystalline</link> bodies formed within the body by accretion or concretion of normal or abnormal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../092/86092.xml">
bile</link> component.</p>
<p>

Gallstones can occur anywhere within the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/594496.xml">
biliary tree</link>, including the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/197020.xml">

<p>

The characteristics of gallstones are various. Independent of appearance, however, gallstones are valuable on the market. </p>

Characteristics</st>

<ss1>
<st>
Size</st>
<p>

A gallstone's size varies and may be as small as a sand grain or as large as a golf ball. The gallbladder may develop a single, often large stone or many smaller ones. They may occur in any part of the biliary system.</p>

Gallstones have different appearance, depending on their contents. On the basis of their contents, gallstones can be subdivided into the two following types:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/6437.xml">
Cholesterol</link> stones</it> are usually green, but are sometimes white or yellow in color. They are made primarily of cholesterol.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Pigment stones</it> are small, dark stones made of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../344/68344.xml">
bilirubin</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/5668.xml">
calcium</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../200/1605200.xml">
salt</link>s that are found in bile. They account for 20&nbsp;percent of gallstones. Risk factors for pigment stones include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../834/584834.xml">
hemolytic anemia</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../060/37060.xml">
cirrhosis</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/594496.xml">
biliary tract</link> infections, and hereditary blood cell disorders, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../657/28657.xml">

spherocytosis</link>.</entry>
</list>
</p>

<ss2>
<st>
Mixed stones</st>
<p>

Mixed stones account for the majority of stones.  Most of these are a mixture of cholesterol and calcium salts.  Because of their calcium content, they can often be visualized radiographically.</p>

Pseudolithiasis</st>

A.k.a., "Fake stone" Sludge-like gallbladder secretions that act like a stone.</p>

</ss2>

<sec>
<st>
Causes</st>
<p>

Researchers believe that gallstones may be caused by a combination of factors, including inherited body chemistry, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../663/537663.xml">
body weight,</link> gallbladder motility (movement), and perhaps diet.  Additionally, people with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../667/518667.xml">
erythropoietic protoporphyria</link> (EPP) are at increased risk to develop gallstones.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts. Besides a high concentration of cholesterol, two other factors seem to be important in causing gallstones. The first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones.</p>
<p>

In addition, increased levels of the hormone <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/22581.xml">
estrogen</link> as a result of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../587/1771587.xml">
pregnancy</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/240150.xml">
hormone therapy</link>, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/4482285.xml">
hormonal contraception</link>, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement, resulting in gallstone formation.</p>
<p>

No clear relationship has been proven between diet and gallstone formation. However, low-fibre, high-cholesterol diets, and diets high in starchy foods have been suggested as contributing to gallstone formation. Other nutritional factors that may increase risk of gallstones include rapid weight loss, constipation, eating fewer meals per day, eating less fish, and low intakes of the nutrients folate, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin C.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> On the other hand, wine and whole grain bread may decrease the risk of gallstones.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The common mnemonic for gallstone risk factors refer to the "four F's": <it>fat</it> (i.e., overweight), <it>forty</it> (an age near or above 40), <it>female</it>, and <it>fertile</it> (pre-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/49611.xml">
menopausal</link>);<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> a fifth F, <it>fair</it> is sometimes added to indicate that the condition is more prevalent in Caucasians. The absence of these risk factors does not, however, preclude the formation of gallstones.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Symptoms</st>
<p>

Gallstones usually remain asymptomatic initially.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> They start developing symptoms once the stones reach a certain size (&amp;gt;8mm).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> A main symptom of gallstones is commonly referred to as a gallstone "attack", also known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/8133602.xml">
biliary colic</link>, in which a person will experience intense pain in the upper abdominal region that steadily increases for approximately thirty minutes to several hours. A patient may also encounter pain in the back, ordinarily between the shoulder blades, or pain under the right shoulder. In some cases, the pain develops in the lower region of the abdomen, nearer to the pelvis, but this is less common. Nausea and vomiting may occur.</p>
<p>

These attacks are sharp and intensely painful, similar to that of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/38074.xml">
kidney stone</link> attack. One way to alleviate the abdominal pain is to drink a full glass of water at the start of an attack to regulate the bile in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/197020.xml">
gallbladder</link>, but this does not work in all cases. Another way is to take magnesium followed by a bitter liquid such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/604727.xml">
coffee</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/6804356.xml">
swedish bitters</link> an hour later. Bitter flavors stimulate bile flow. A study has found lower rates of gallstones in coffee drinkers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Often, these attacks occur after a particularly fatty meal and almost always happen at night. Other symptoms include abdominal bloating, intolerance of fatty foods, belching, gas, and indigestion. If the above symptoms coincide with chills, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/560153.xml">
lowgrade fever</link>, yellowing of the skin or eyes, and/or clay-colored stool, a doctor should be consulted immediately.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

Some people who have gallstones are asymptomatic and do not feel any pain or discomfort. These gallstones are called "silent stones" and do not affect the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/197020.xml">
gallbladder</link> or other internal organs. They do not need treatment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

Treatment</st>

<ss1>
<st>
Medical options</st>
<p>

Cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved by oral <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../471/1351471.xml">
ursodeoxycholic acid</link>,  but it may be required that the patient takes this medication for up to two years<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>. Gallstones may recur however, once the drug is stopped. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by <link>
endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy</link> (ERS) following <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../835/756835.xml">
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</link> (ERCP). Gallstones can be broken up using a procedure called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../804/47804.xml">
lithotripsy</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../804/47804.xml">
Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy</link>)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>, which is a method of concentrating ultrasonic shock waves onto the stones to break them into tiny pieces. They are then passed safely in the feces. However, this form of treatment is only suitable when there are a small number of gallstones.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Surgical options</st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/581931.xml">
Cholecystectomy</link> (gallbladder removal) has a 99% chance of eliminating the recurrence of cholelithiasis. Only symptomatic patients must be indicated to surgery. The lack of a gall bladder does not seem to have any negative consequences in many people. However, there is a significant proportion of the population, between 5-40%, who develop a condition called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/6038307.xml">
postcholecystectomy syndrome</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>Symptoms include gastrointestinal distress and persistent pain in the upper right abdomen. As many as twenty percent of patients develop chronic diarrhea.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>
<p>

There are two surgery options: open procedure and laparoscopic: see the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/581931.xml">
cholecystectomy</link> article for more details.
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Open cholecystectomy procedure: This involves a large incision into the abdomen (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../836/337836.xml">
laparotomy</link>) below the right lower ribs. A week of hospitalization, normal diet a week after release and normal activity a month after release.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../480/18480.xml">
Laparoscopic</link> cholecystectomy: Three to four small puncture holes for camera and instruments (available since the 1980s). Typically same-day release or one night hospital stay, followed by a week of home rest and pain medication. Can resume normal diet and light activity a week after release. (Decreased energy level and minor residual pain for a month or two.) Studies have shown that this procedure is as effective as the more invasive open cholecystectomy, provided the stones are accurately located by cholangiogram prior to the procedure so that they can all be removed. The procedure also has the benefit of reducing operative complications such as bowel perforation and vascular injury.</entry>
</list>
</p>

</ss1>

Alternative medicine</st>
<p>

A regimen called a "gallbladder flush" or "liver flush" is a popular remedy in alternative medicine.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> In this treatment, often self-administered, the patient drinks four glasses of pure apple juice (not cider) and eats five apples (or applesauce) per day for five days, then fasts briefly, takes magnesium, and then drinks large quantities of lemon juice mixed with olive oil before bed. The next morning, they painlessly pass a number of green and brown pebbles purported to be stones flushed from the biliary system. </p>
<p>

A New Zealand hospital analyzed stones from a typical gallbladder flush and found them to be composed of fatty acids similar to those in olive oil, with no detectable cholesterol or bile salts,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> demonstrating that they are little more than hardened olive oil. Despite the gallbladder flush, the patient still required surgical removal of multiple true gallstones. The note concluded: "The gallbladder flush may not be entirely worthless, however; there is one case report in which treatment with olive oil and lemon juice resulted in the passage of numerous gallstones, as demonstrated by ultrasound examination."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
<p>

In the case mentioned, ultrasound confirmed multiple gallstones, but after waiting months for a surgical option, the patient underwent a treatment with olive oil and lemon juice resulting in the passage of four 2.5–cm by 1.25–cm stones and twenty pea-sized stones. Two years later symptoms returned, and ultrasound showed a single large gallstone; the patient chose to have this removed surgically.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
<p>

Other patients have noticed that symptoms can be reduced by drinking several glasses of water when experiencing gallstone pain.  This will obviously not eliminate the gallstones, but can temporarily reduce the pain.</p>

Value</st>
<p>

Gallstones are a valuable by-product of meat processing, fetching up to US$32–per–gram in their use as a purported <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../949/43949.xml">
antipyretic</link> and antidote in the herbal medicine of some cultures, particularly in China. The finest gallstones tend to be sourced from old dairy cows, which are called <it>Niu-Huang</it> (yellow thing of oxen) in Chinese. Those obtained from dogs, called <it>Gou-Bao</it> (treasure of dogs) in Chinese, are also used today. Much as in the manner of diamond mines, slaughterhouses carefully scrutinize offal department workers for gallstone theft.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
