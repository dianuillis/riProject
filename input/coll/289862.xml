In the absence of agreement about its meaning, the term "social" is used in many different senses, referring among other things to:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

In one broad meaning, "social" refers only to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/37235.xml">
society</link> as "a system of common life", but in another sense it contrasts specifically with "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/14593.xml">
individual</link>" and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../181/15181.xml">
individualist</link> theories of society. This is reflected for instance in the different perspectives of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/19280734.xml">
liberalism</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/26847.xml">
socialism</link> on society and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../618/587618.xml">
public affairs</link>.</p>
<p>

The adjective "social" implies that the verb or noun to which it is applied is somehow more communicative, cooperative, and moderated by contact with human beings, than if it were omitted. That is, it implies that larger society has played some role in defining the idea or the principle. For instance terms like social realism, social justice, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/203510.xml">
social constructivism</link>, social psychology and social capital imply that there is some social process involved or considered, a process that is not there in regular, "non-social", realism, justice, constructivism, psychology, or capital.</p>
<p>

The adjective "social" is also used often in political discourse, although its meaning in such a context depends heavily on who is using it. In left-wing circles it is often used to imply a positive characteristic, while in right-wing circles it is generally used to imply a negative characteristic. It should also be noted that, overall, this adjective is used much more often by those on the political left than by those on the political right. </p>
<p>

For these reasons, those seeking to avoid association with the left-right political debates often seek to label their work with phrases that do not include the word "social". An example is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../731/159731.xml">
quasi-empiricism in mathematics</link> which is sometimes labelled social constructivism by those who see it as an unwarranted intrusion of social considerations in mathematical practice, which is supposed to be "objective" and "above" social concerns.</p>

Social theorists</st>

<p>

In the view of <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<philosopher wordnetid="110423589" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/16743.xml">
Karl Marx</link></philosopher>
</person>
, human beings are intrinsically, necessarily and by definition social beings who - beyond being "gregarious creatures" - cannot survive and meet their needs other than through social co-operation and association. Their social characteristics are therefore to a large extent an objectively given fact, stamped on them from birth and affirmed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../400/42400.xml">
socialization</link> processes; and, according to Marx, in producing and reproducing their material life, people must necessarily enter into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/1159597.xml">
relations of production</link> which are "independent of their will". </p>
<p>

By contrast, the sociologist <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/19455.xml">
Max Weber</link></person>
 for example defines human action as "social" if, by virtue of the subjective meanings attached to the action by individuals, it "takes account of the behavior of others, and is thereby oriented in its course". In this case, the "social" domain really exists only in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../811/1943811.xml">
intersubjective</link> relations between individuals, but by implication the life of these individuals also exists in part outside the social domain. "Social" is thus implicitly also contrasted with "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/25009.xml">
private</link>".</p>
<p>

In the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/2871407.xml">
positivist</link> sociology of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../218/38218.xml">
Emile Durkheim</link>, a social fact is an abstraction external to the individual which constrains that individual's actions. In his 1895 work <it>Rules of Sociological Method</it>, Durkheim writes: "A social fact is every way of acting, fixed or not, capable of exercising on the individual an influence, or an external constraint; or again, every way of acting which is general throughout a given society, while at the same time existing in its own right independent of its individual manifestations." In Durkheim's view, sociology is 'the science of social facts'.</p>

 discourses at length in his classic work <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../779/1922779.xml">
The Social Contract</link></it>). Originally the term "socialist" was often used interchangeably with "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/89313.xml">
co-operative</link>", "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/51483.xml">

<p>

The term <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../265/18247265.xml">
social democracy</link> originally referred to the political project of extending <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/7959.xml">

social ownership</link> for the rule of a propertied class which had exclusive voting rights.</p>

Modern uses</st>

<p>

In contemporary society, "social" often refers to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../622/552622.xml">
redistributive</link> policies of the government which aim to apply resources in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/340401.xml">
public interest</link>, for example, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../691/27691.xml">
social security</link>. Policy concerns then include the problems of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../028/3229028.xml">
social exclusion</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/16591621.xml">
social cohesion</link>. Here, "social" contrasts with "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/25009.xml">
private</link>" and to the distinction between the public and the private (or privatised) spheres, where <link>
ownership relations</link> define access to resources and attention.</p>
<p>

The social domain is often also contrasted with that of physical nature, but in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../919/27919.xml">
sociobiology</link> analogies are drawn between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/682482.xml">

social geography</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/26990.xml">

Regional uses</st>

<p>

There is a peculiar use of "social" in some parts of the world. In the Canadian province of <district wordnetid="108552138" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../926/18926.xml">
Manitoba</link></district>
, a "social" is a fund raising party (for a wedding, non-profit organisation, charity, or some other worthy cause). It is also known as a <link>
Manitoba Social</link>. Typically, they will include music (current popular music for the youth and "oldies" music for older adults), dancing, food, raffles (and other fund raising games). When held in support of a wedding, often they are used as a way to shake down some details of the wedding (e.g., letting the bride try a hair style, practicing dancing, etc.).</p>

 is that of a leisure-time gathering with food and drink, organised by an institution, association, or company.
A distinguishing feature is that it is deliberately organised at a venue at a predetermined time. Thus one might say, "are you going to the social?", meaning a social event by some organisation.</p>
