<b>Accidental death and dismemberment insurance</b> (also known as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../385/3305385.xml">
AD&amp;D</link>)</it> is a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/15176.xml">
insurance</link> covering death or specific types of injury as a result of an accident.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  In the event of accidental death, this insurance will pay benefits in addition to any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/383367.xml">
life insurance</link> held.  Death by illness, suicide, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/517279.xml">
natural causes</link> is generally not covered by AD&amp;D.  Additionally, AD&amp;D generally pays benefits for the loss of limbs, fingers, sight and permanent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../254/23254.xml">
paralysis</link>.  The types of injuries covered and the amount paid vary by insurer and package, and are explicitly enumerated in the insurance policy.<p>

There are four common types of group AD&amp;D plans offered in the United States:</p>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Travel Accident (Business Trip) - the AD&amp;D benefit is provided through an employee benefit plan and provides supplemental accident protection to workers while they are traveling on company business (the entire premium is usually paid by the employer);</entry>
