 established that one common form of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../968/759968.xml">
replicator</link> has several parts:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../388/12388.xml">
genome</link>, a compact, usually error-resistant representation of the replicator's stored algorithm.  Biologically, this is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../955/7955.xml">
DNA</link>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

A specialized set of mechanisms to copy and repair the genome, using resources gathered by the body.  Biologically, this is something like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../926/235926.xml">
DNA polymerase</link>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

A body, which gathers resources and energy, and interprets a stored <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>.  Biologically, these are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/25766.xml">
ribosome</link>s.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Exceptions to this pattern are possible.  For example, scientists have successfully constructed RNA that copies itself in an "environment" that is a solution of RNA monomers and transcriptase.  In this case, the body is the genome, and the specialized copy mechanisms are external.</p>
<p>

However, the simplest possible case is that only a genome exists.  Without some specification of the self-reproducing steps, a genome-only system is probably better characterized as something like a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/6015.xml">
crystal</link>.</p>

Recent research <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.htm">
http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.htm</weblink> has begun to categorize replicators, often based on the amount of support they require.</p>
<p>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Natural replicators have all or most of their design from nonhuman sources. Such systems include natural life forms.</entry>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/5323.xml">
computer science</link> a self-reproducing computer program is a computer program that, when executed, outputs its own code.  This is also called a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../270/25270.xml">

A more trivial approach is to write a program that will make a copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated.</p>
<p>

This approach is common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler in that it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself.</p>
<p>

In many programming languages an empty program is still a legal program, which executes without producing errors or any other output. The output is thus the same as the source code, so the program is trivially self-reproducing.</p>

It is a long-term goal of some engineering sciences to achieve a <b>clanking replicator</b>, a material device that can self-replicate.  The usual reason is to achieve a low cost per item while retaining the utility of a manufactured good.  Many authorities say that in the limit, the cost of self-replicating items should approach the cost-per-weight of wood or other biological substances, because self-replication avoids the costs of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../178/18178.xml">
labor</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/5187.xml">

The goal of self-replication in space systems is to exploit large amounts of matter with a low launch mass.  For example, an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/295509.xml">
autotroph</link>ic self-replicating machine could cover a moon or planet with solar cells, and beam the power to the Earth using microwaves.  Once in place, the same machinery that built itself could also produce raw materials or manufactured objects, including transportation systems to ship the products.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/500163.xml">
Another model</link> of self-replicating machine would copy itself through the galaxy, sending information back.</p>
<p>

In general, since these systems are autotrophic, they are the most difficult and complex known replicators.  They are also thought to be the most hazardous, because they do not require any inputs from human beings in order to reproduce.</p>
<p>

A classic theoretical study of replicators in space is the 1980 <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/18426568.xml">

 study of autotrophic clanking replicators, edited by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../795/25795.xml">
Robert Freitas</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing lunar <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/204967.xml">
regolith</link>, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in regolith.  The limiting element was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../667/5667.xml">
Chlorine</link>, an essential element to process regolith for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/904.xml">
Aluminium</link>.  Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, and a substantially faster rate of reproduction could be assured by importing modest amounts.</p>
<p>

The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails.  Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../781/25781.xml">
robot</link>.</p>
<p>

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/29373.xml">
solar cell</link>s supported on pillars.  The other machinery could run under the canopy.</p>
<p>

A "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/53601.xml">
casting</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../781/25781.xml">
robot</link>" would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../731/331731.xml">
plaster</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../211/605211.xml">
mold</link>s.  Plaster molds are easy to make, and make precise parts with good surface finishes.  The robot would then cast most of the parts either from non-conductive molten rock (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/43534.xml">
basalt</link>) or purified metals.  An <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../3$00/Radeon_R$300.xml">
electric</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../536/445536.xml">
oven</link> melted the materials.</p>
<p>

A speculative, more complex "chip factory" was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins".</p>

Molecular manufacturing</st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../488/21488.xml">

These systems are substantially simpler than autotrophic systems, because they are provided with purified feedstocks and energy.  They do not have to reproduce them. This distinction is at the root of some of the controversy about whether <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../637/19637.xml">
molecular manufacturing</link> is possible or not.  Many authorities who find it impossible are clearly citing sources for complex autotrophic self-replicating systems.  Many of the authorities who find it possible are clearly citing sources for much simpler self-assembling systems, which have been demonstrated.  In the meantime, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../362/18362.xml">
LEGO</link>-built autonomous robot able to follow a pre-set track and assemble an exact copy of itself, starting from four externally-provided components, was demonstrated experimentally in 2003 <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm">

Merely exploiting the replicative abilities of existing cells is insufficient, because of limitations in the process of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/24553.xml">
protein biosynthesis</link> (also see the listing for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/25758.xml">

What is required is the rational design of an entirely novel replicator with a much wider range of synthesis capabilities.</p>
