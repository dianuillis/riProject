 and <link>
CDC 924</link> systems.  Over time, a range of machines were produced - divided into the 'upper 3000 series' and the 'lower 3000 series'.  CDC phased out production of the 3000 series in the early 1970s.  The 3000 series were the 'cash cows' of Control Data during the 1960's; sales of these machines funded the company while the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/4120803.xml">
6000 series</link> was designed.</p>
<p>

The upper 3000 series used a 48 bit word size.  The first machine to be produced was the <b>CDC 3600</b>; first delivered in June 1963.  First deliveries of the <b>CDC 3400</b> and <b>CDC 3800</b> were in December 1965.  These machines were designed for scientific computing applications, however were eventually overshadowed by the 60-bit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../803/4120803.xml">
CDC 6000 series</link> machines.</p>
<p>

The lower 3000 series used a 24 bit word size.  They were based on the earlier <link>
CDC 924</link> - a 24-bit version of the <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.8">

.  The first lower 3000 to be released was the <b>CDC 3200</b> (may 1964), followed by the smaller <b>CDC 3100</b> (February 1965), and the <b>CDC 3300</b> (December 1965).  The final machine in the series, the <b>CDC 3500</b>, was released in march of 1967 and used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/15150.xml">
integrated circuit</link>s instead of discrete components.  The 3300 and 3500 had optional relocation capabilities, floating point, and <it>BDP</it> (Business + Data Processing) instructions.  These machines were targeted towards 'business and commercial' computing.</p>
<p>

The instruction set of the upper 3000 series was composed mostly of 24-bit instructions (packed 2 per word), but also contained some 48-bit instructions.  The lower 3000 was based on a 24-bit subset of those available on the upper 3000 systems.  It was therefore possible to write programs which would run on all 3000 systems.  And as these systems were based on the prior 1604 and 924 instruction sets, some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/4459.xml">
backward compatibility</link> also existed.  However the systems did diverge from each other in areas such as relocation and the BDP instructions.</p>
<p>

All 3000 series computers used <link>
core memory</link>.</p>

 Architecture </st>
<p>

The lower 3000 CPU was a 24-bit architecture:  instructions were 24 bits in length, as were the two operand registers A and Q.  There were 4 index registers of 15 bits, R0 through R3, though R0 is always zero (zero when read; writes don't affect the value).  There was no status (flags or condition code) register.  Up to 32,768 (24-bit) words of core memory could be directly addressed, and multiple banks could be switched in.  Two or three memory bank configurations were the most common.</p>
<p>

Each instruction contained 6 bits of opcode, 1 bit specifying whether indirect addressing used, 2 bits of index register address and 15 bits of address.</p>
<p>

Arithmetic was <link>
ones complement</link>, so the complexities of zero and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/2907387.xml">
negative zero</link> existed.  The A and Q register could function as a combined 48-bit register for certain arithmetic instructions.</p>
<p>

The 3300 CPU could execute around 1 million instructions per second (1 <unit_of_measurement wordnetid="113583724" confidence="0.8">

), giving it supercomputer status in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/34750.xml">
1965</link>.</p>

<p>

The earliest operating system for the lower 3000 series was called RTS OS.  However it was quickly replaced with MSOS (Mass Storage OS).  The premier <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> for the CDC 3300 and CDC 3500 was called MASTER.  MASTER was interrupt-driven, supported large memory, multi-tasking.</p>
<p>

An operating system called REAL-TIME <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../953/6975953.xml">
SCOPE</link> existed for both lower- and upper-3000 systems.  A disk-based version of SCOPE was eventually made available for the upper-3000 systems.</p>

 Character set </st>
<p>

The operating systems for the CDC 3xxx typically used 6 bit characters, so the <it>64 character set</it> did not contain lowercase letters.  The character set contained (in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../830/4488830.xml">
display code</link> order). This 6-bit extension of the 4-bit BCD encoding was referred to as BCDIC (BCD interchange code.) IBM later extended this code further to create the 8-bit "extended BCDIC", or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/12442170.xml">
EBCDIC</link> code.
<indent level="1">

 A-Z 0-9 + - * / ( ) $ = <it>(space)</it> , . #  [ ] % " _ ! &amp; ' ?  &amp;gt; @ \ ^ ;
</indent>
Depending on the device, some characters are rendered differently, especially the lineprinter and some terminals:
