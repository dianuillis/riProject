amateur radio</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/2421114.xml">
contest</link>.  WRTC is an invitation-only event in which the world's elite contesters compete against one another using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/3343966.xml">
amateur radio station</link>s that are in one geographic area of the world and are equipped with similar <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../317/187317.xml">
antenna</link>s and operating restrictions.  Each WRTC event is organized by a standing committee of internationally recognized contesters and a host organization in the locality where the competition will be held.  WRTC is the closest thing to a world championships in the sport of contesting.

 being held that summer in the same city.  Teams of two competitors each operated in a unique, one-time contest, created specifically to coincide with WRTC. All of the stations used by the WRTC teams were located at existing amateur radio stations in the Seattle area, but not all of the stations were in equally advantageous locations, and some had more desirable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/2797722.xml">

.  In addition to the two team members, a referee was present at each station to monitor compliance with the WRTC rules. First place went to the team of John Dorr K1AR and Doug Grant K1DG of the United States, second place to the team of Mike Wetzel W9RE and Chip Margelli K7JA of the United States, and third place went to Jeff Steinman KRØY and Bob Shohet KQ2M of the United States.</p>

, USA area in July, 1996, and was organized by the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nccc.cc/">

The format continued to be teams of two competitors each, operating at stations with similar antenna and power restrictions, participating in the IARU HF World Championship, a world-wide operating event that includes both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/41831.xml">

 operation.  A major innovation at WRTC 1996 was the assignment of special-event call signs to each of the competitive stations.  The call signs were assigned randomly to each team, and helped prevent other stations in the IARU HF World Championship contest from recognizing their friends.  The special call signs also ensured that all stations had call signs that took approximately the same amount of time to speak <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../552/41552.xml">

.  While the event headquarters were in the resort city of <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../919/63919.xml">

, the competitive stations were spread throughout the country.  Most competitors arriving in Slovenia were greeted by ceremonial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../357/92357.xml">
military</link> escort and the nation's top political figures were in attendance at the opening and closing ceremonies.  A new innovation to the competition was the inclusion of a "pile-up" competition, in which individual competitors listened to a recording of overlapping call signs sent in Morse code and attempted to accurately identify and record as many as possible.  WRTC 2000 was also the first event where all stations were equipped with antennas of identical manufacture installed at identical heights above ground.  Fifty-three teams of two operators each represented twenty-five nations.  First place went to the team of Jeff Steinman N5TJ and Dan Street K1TO of the United States, second place to the team of Igor Booklan RA3AUU and Andrei Karpov RV1AW of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

WRTC 2002 was held in July in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/13696.xml">
Helsinki, Finland</link>.  A major innovation in Finland was a near-real-time scoreboard publish on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/33898.xml">
web site</link> during the event.  On-site referees at each WRTC competition station used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/19644137.xml">
cellular phones</link> to send their station's running contact totals and score to a central <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link> each hour.  The scores were published during the event on a web site that listed only the call signs of the operators at each site, not the randomly-assigned special-event call sign being used on the air.  Fifty-two teams of two operators each represented twenty-eight countries.  First place went to the team of Jeff Steinman N5TJ and Dan Street K1TO of the United States, second place to the team of Igor Booklan RA3AUU and Andrei Karpov RV1AW of Russia, and third place went to the team of Frank Grossmann DL2CC and Bernd Och DL6FBL of Germany.

, and introduced a sophisticated qualification scoring system for potential competitors.  47 teams were selected for the event, but only 46 actually participated.  Brazilian airline <airline wordnetid="102690081" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 team was unable to make other travel arrangements in time.  Teams were provided with larger antennas and 700 watt amplifiers in 2006, to help compensate for the greater distance from Brazil to the main centers of contesting activity in Europe and North America.  Despite taking place during the solar minimum, the contest coincided with a short spike in conditions on the HF bands allowing high scores.  After winning three WRTCs in a row, Jeff Steinman N5TJ and Dan Street K1TO did not compete in the 2006 event.  First place went to John Sluymer VE3EJ and James Roberts VE7ZO of Canada, the first time a team from outside the United States had won the WRTC competition.  Dan Craig N6MJ and Dave Mueller N2NL of the United States achieved second place, and third place went to Doug Grant K1DG and Andy Blank N2NT of the United States.  Rank Boca YT6A and Djurica Maletin YT6T of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 had been in third place in preliminary results, but after a scoring adjudication that removed "unique" contacts from WRTC logs, were rescored into eleventh place.</p>
<p>

It has been announced by the WRTC Sanctioning Committee that WRTC 2010 will be held in Russia, organized by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/18735084.xml">

<p>

The process of selection and invitation to compete in the World Radiosport Team Championship has varied with each event.  In some years, the selection has been entirely at the discretion of the organizing committee, which has generally relied upon the past contest results of individuals who have applied for inclusion in the competition to make their decisions.  In other years, selection has been delegated to national radio societies or major contest clubs, which have voted on the contesters that they wanted to represent them.  The selection process is generally structured to ensure a certain number of contesters from each part of the world and a certain number from specific countries will be invited to the competition.  Participants selected to compete in WRTC are generally not sponsored and must pay their own travel and lodging expenses in order to attend.</p>
<p>

Each team of two contesters participates in the IARU HF World Championship radio contest, held on the second full weekend of July.  A random draw is done to assign each team to a particular station, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/400892.xml">
referee</link>, and call sign.  Teams are generally allowed to bring their own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/41805.xml">
transceiver</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../884/191884.xml">
headphones</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/65886.xml">
microphone</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/187553.xml">
telegraph key</link>s, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/3071163.xml">
contest logging software</link>, but are required to use the antennas provided for them at their assigned station.  In addition to respecting the rules of the IARU HF World Championship contest, WRTC teams might have additional operating restrictions.  Historically, the scoring formula used for WRTC stations has not always been the same as the scoring formula used for the IARU HF World Championship.  On-site referees are present to ensure compliance with the WRTC competition rules.  Many WRTC site referees are former WRTC competitors.</p>
