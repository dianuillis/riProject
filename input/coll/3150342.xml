<b>Brain Gym</b> is a commercial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/156423.xml">
training</link> program that claims that any learning challenges can be overcome by finding the right movements, the use of which will create new pathways in the brain.  They claim that the repetition of the 26 Brain Gym movements "activates the brain for optimal storage and retrieval of information."  Its theoretical foundation has been thoroughly discredited by the scientific community, who describe it as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../047/23047.xml">
pseudoscience</link>.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/24116.xml">
Peer review</link>ed scientific studies into Brain Gym have found no significant improvement in general academic skills.  Its claimed results have been put down to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/142821.xml">
placebo</link> effect and the benefits of breaks and exercise.  Its founder, Paul Dennison, has admitted that many of Brain Gym's claims are not based good science, but on his "hunches".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  It is widely used in British state schools.  It is also offered to both children and adults in parts of the United States and Canada.

 History </st>

<p>

What became Brain Gym began in Paul and Gail Dennison's work in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/34555.xml">
1970s</link>, researching more effective ways to help learning disabled children and adults.  They call their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/242710.xml">
field of study</link>, which they founded during this period, "Educational Kinesiology" (Edu-K), a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../168/4276168.xml">
applied kinesiology</link>.  They define Edu-K as "learning through movement".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>.  </p>
<p>

Some of the specific movements the program uses were, according to the Brain Gym website, developed from Paul Dennison's "knowledge of the relationship of movement to perception, and the impact of these on fine motor and academic skills."  Others were learned during his training as a marathon runner, his study of vision training, his study of Jin Shin Jitsu (a form of acupressure), and his study of Applied Kinesiology.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The Dennisons presented their program under its current name in their booklets <it>Switching On: A Guide to Edu-Kinesthetics</it> (1980) and <it>Brain Gym &ndash; Simple Activities for Whole Brain Learning</it> (1986).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> </p>
<p>

Brain Gym is now used in more than 80 countries.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

<p>

The program is based on the premise that all learning begins with movement, and that any learning challenges can be overcome by finding the right movements, to subsequently create new pathways in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../717/3717.xml">
brain</link>.  It claims that the repetition of certain movements "activates the brain for optimal storage and retrieval of information" and "promotes efficient communication among the many nerve cells and functional centers located throughout the brain and sensory motor system."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>  There are 26 of these exercises, which are designed to "integrate body and mind" in order to improve "concentration, memory, reading, writing, organizing, listening, physical coordination, and more."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Educational Kinesiology teaches that brain function is defined in terms of three dimensions: laterality is the ability to co-ordinate the left and right sides of the brain, focus is the ability to co-ordinate the front and back of the brain, and centering is the ability to co-ordinate the top and bottom of the brain.  According to Brain Gym, people whose brains are not interconnected properly in the three different dimensions suffer from corresponding deficits; for example, the ability to move and think at the same time is dependent on laterality (left to right co-ordination).  The Brain Gym exercises are claimed to work by interconnecting the brain in these three dimensions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../674/674.xml">

The Educational Kinesiology Foundation is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/72487.xml">

.  It was established in 1987.  It has a board of directors, but their names are not listed on the Brain Gym website.  Brain Gym International is also based in Ventura.  The relationship between the two organisations is not explained on the Brain Gym website.  Brain Gym is a registered trademark of Brain Gym International.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

The Brain Gym instructor program is open to anyone.  To become qualied as a consultant there is a four stage training program, which consists of fourteen short courses of between twenty-four and forty hours in length.  The trainee must also complete fifteen case studies, and attend six private consultations with a qualified instructor - these can be completed over the telephone.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>

Brain Gym has been criticized as being wholly unscientific in a wide-ranging and authoritative review of research into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/21245.xml">
neuroscience</link> and education published in 2007 by the UK <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../854/7991854.xml">

<p>

In May 2006, Professor Usha Goswami, the director of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../796/31796.xml">
Cambridge University</link>'s Centre for Neuroscience in Education, wrote an article published in <it><periodical wordnetid="106593296" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../427/43427.xml">

</it>, in which she says that BrainGym and similar programmes are based on "neuromyths" that "need to be eliminated". She attributes the "success of the brain-based learning industry" to "inspirational marketing" which "ensures that teachers who attend these conferences do get 'sold' on the supposed benefits of these programmes" and to "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/142821.xml">
placebo</link> effects" that "may indeed bring benefits to children in the short term."  In summary, she says that teachers are very interested in neuroscience, but science is not yet ready to offer practical advice.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

 scientists responded to statements taken from the "Brain Gym guide (Teacher’s Edition)".  Each of them entirely rejected the statements that were put to them.  Brain Gym's scientific content was described as "pseudo-scientific".  One of the scientists, Professor of neuroscience Colin Blakemore, said that "there have been a few <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/24116.xml">
peer review</link>ed scientific studies into the methods of Brain Gym, but none of them found a significant improvement in general academic skills."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>  Sense about Science, along with the <link>

 wrote a paper in which he analysed the available research into Brian Gym, as well as its theoretical basis.  He concluded that Brain Gym is not supported by research, and that its theoretical basis does not stand up.  The paper also encouraged teachers to learn how to read and understand research, to avoid teaching material that has no rational basis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>

Most scientists would argue that filling the gulf is premature. Nevertheless, at present, teachers are at the receiving end of numerous 'brain-based learning' packages. Some of these contain alarming amounts of misinformation, yet such packages are being used in many schools.”</cite>&nbsp;</entry>
