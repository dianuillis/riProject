Overview</st>

<p>

CP/CMS was built by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 (CSC), an R&amp;D lab with very close ties to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../061/19061.xml">
MIT</link>. The system's goals, development process, release, and legacy &ndash; and its breakthrough technology &ndash; all set this system apart from other operating systems of its day, and from other large IBM projects. In particular, it was an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/18938758.xml">
open-source</link> system, made available in source code form to all IBM customers at no charge &ndash; as part of the unsupported <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../204/7218204.xml">
IBM Type-III Library</link>. CP/CMS users supported themselves and each other. Unusual circumstances, described in the <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 section below, led to this situation.</p>
<p>

CP/CMS consisted of two main components: </p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>CP</b>, the <it>Control Program</it>, created the virtual machine environment. The widely-used version was CP-67, which ran on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/7522024.xml">
S/360-67</link>. (The research system <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/7506207.xml">
CP-40</link> established the architecture. A third version, CP-370, became <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../018/315018.xml">
VM/370</link></O>
.) Instead of explicitly dividing up memory and other resources among users, which had been the traditional approach, CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/29294.xml">
System/360</link> computer, able to run any S/360 software that ran on the bare machine. This gave each user what was, in effect, a private computer system. </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>CMS</b>, the <it>Cambridge Monitor System</it> (and also <it>Console Monitor System</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> &ndash; but renamed <shell wordnetid="104190464" confidence="0.8">

) was a lightweight single-user operating system, for interactive timesharing use. By running many copies of CMS in CP's virtual machines &ndash; instead of multiple copies of large, traditional multi-tasking operating systems &ndash; the overhead per user was less. This allowed a great number of simultaneous users to share a single S/360.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The CP/CMS virtual machine concept was an important step forward in operating system design. </p>
<p>

 By isolating users from each other, CP/CMS greatly improved system reliability and security. </entry>

</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 By simulating a full, stand-alone computer for each user, CP/CMS could run <it>any</it> S/360 software in a time-sharing environment &ndash; not just applications specifically designed for time-sharing.</entry>

 By using lightweight CMS as the primary user interface, CP/CMS achieved unprecedented time-sharing performance. In addition, the simplicity of CMS made it easier to implement user interface enhancements than in traditional operating systems.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

IBM reimplemented CP/CMS as its <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../018/315018.xml">

 product line, released in 1972 when <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/32354.xml">
virtual memory</link> was added to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/59785.xml">
S/370</link> series. VM/370's successors (such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../680/1266680.xml">
z/VM</link>) remain in wide use today. (It is important to note that IBM <it>reimplemented</it> CP-67, as it had <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/7506207.xml">
CP-40</link>, and did not simply rename and repackage it. <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../018/315018.xml">
VM</link></O>
 coexisted with CP/CMS and its successors for many years. It is thus appropriate to view CP/CMS as an independent operating system, distinct from the <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../018/315018.xml">

 family.)</p>
<p>

CP/CMS was viewed as "IBM's <it>other</it> operating system" &ndash; a poor cousin to IBM's recommended batch-oriented offerings. (Until recently, <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../018/315018.xml">
VM</link></O>
 remained in this role.) But CP/CMS rose above limited resources and company politics, to create an enduring and important technical legacy, a fiercely loyal user base, major derivative systems in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/30958.xml">
time-sharing</link> industry, and, ultimately, a heritage as the grandparent of major 21st century products from IBM.</p>

<p>

<b>Note:</b> <it>Source code distribution at IBM before 1978 is a murky topic, as are related issues of software copyrights and trade secrets. Operating system source code is not directly discussed in the major references, other than the special cases of CP/CMS and VM. Wikipedia contributors have clear but inconsistent first-hand memories. The following description represents the best information available as of December 2006, but will be revised as better source material can be located.</it></p>
<p>

CP/CMS was distributed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../661/27661.xml">
source code</link> form, and many CP/CMS users were actively involved in studying and modifying that source code. Such direct user involvement with a vendor-supplied operating system was unusual.</p>
<p>

In the CP/CMS era, many vendors distributed operating systems in machine-readable source code. It is possible that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/14387737.xml">
OS/360</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/626229.xml">
DOS/360</link>, and a number of later "mainstream" IBM operating systems were distributed in this way; at any rate, their source code was certainly available in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../268/2842268.xml">
microfiche</link> form, and was widely used by systems programmers at customer sites. With all these systems, some awareness of system source code was also involved in the <link>
SYSGEN</link> process (comparable to a <link>
kernel build</link> in modern systems); likewise in installing a <link>
Starter Set</link>. (Forty years later, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../374/55374.xml">
Hercules emulator</link> can be used to run "fossilized" versions of these systems, based on source code that is now treated as part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/18935551.xml">
public domain</link>.)</p>
<p>

The importance of operating system source code has changed over time. Before <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../182/7283182.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Unbundling+of+software+and+services%22])">
IBM unbundled software from hardware</link> in 1969, the operating system (and most other software) was included in the cost of the hardware; and a single vendor had complete responsibility for the entire system, hardware and software. This made the distribution medium relatively unimportant. After IBM's unbundling, OS software was delivered as <link>
IBM System Control Program (SCP) software</link> &ndash; eventually in "object code only" form, but still at no additional charge. </p>
<p>

For complicated reasons, CP/CMS was not released in the normal way. It was not supported by IBM, but was made part of the unsupported <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../204/7218204.xml">
IBM Type-III Library</link> &ndash; a collection of software contributed by customers and IBM personnel. IBM distributed this library to its customers for use 'as is'. The lack of direct IBM support for such products forced active users to support themselves, and encouraged them to make modifications and to support each other. CP/CMS and other Type-III products were thus an early form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/10635.xml">
free software</link>.</p>
<p>

Source code distribution of other IBM operating systems may have continued for some time &ndash; e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/14387737.xml">
OS/360</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/626229.xml">
DOS/360</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../682/32682.xml">
DOS/VSE</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/19649.xml">
MVS</link>, and even <link>
TSS/370</link>, which all today are generally considered to be in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/18935551.xml">
public domain</link>  &ndash; since they were arguably published without a copyright notice before 1978.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> However, the unsupported status of CP/CMS placed different pressures on its user community, and raised the importance for them of source code distribution.</p>
<p>

Curiously, CP/CMS was contributed to the Type-III Library by MIT's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../536/637536.xml">
Lincoln Laboratory</link> &ndash; and <it>not</it> by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../343/450343.xml">
CSC</link> or any other IBM unit &ndash; despite the fact that the system was built by IBM's <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<facility wordnetid="103315023" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/7145862.xml">

</artifact>
. This surprising decision has been described as a form of "collusion" to outmaneuver the IBM political forces opposed to time-sharing. It may also reflect the amount of formal and informal input from MIT (also <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

) that was contributed to the design and implementation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/7506207.xml">
CP-40</link>, the S/360-67, CP-67, and CMS. See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../460/8177460.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Historical+notes%22])">
History of CP/CMS (historical notes)</link> for further insights and references on this topic.</p>
<p>

Many CP/CMS users made extensive modifications to their own copies of the source code. Much of this work was shared among sites, and important changes found their way back into the core system. Other users, such as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<enterprise wordnetid="108056231" confidence="0.8">
<business wordnetid="108061042" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/6190513.xml">

</company>
 and some academic sites, continued independent development of CP/CMS, rather than switching to VM/370 when it became available. These efforts diverged from the community, in what today would be termed a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/301506.xml">
software fork</link>.</p>
<p>

After IBM released VM/370, source code distribution of VM continued for several releases. (The VM project did not adopt the use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/1033828.xml">
PL/S</link>, an internal systems programming language mandated for use within IBM on many comparable projects. The use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/1033828.xml">
PL/S</link> would have made source code distribution impossible. IBM attempted to turn away from assembly language to higher level languages as early as 1965, and was making substantial use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/1033828.xml">
PL/S</link> by 1969, e.g. in MVS. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/1033828.xml">
PL/S</link> was considered a trade secret at the time, and was not available to customers. IBM apparently made exceptions to this policy much later.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>) The VM user community continued to make important contributions to the software, as it had during the CP/CMS Type-III period. Few OS or DOS sites exhibited active user involvement in deep operating system internals; but this was found at many VM sites . This "reverse support" helped CP/CMS concepts survive and evolve &ndash; despite VM's "second class citizen" status at IBM.</p>

 The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/30958.xml">

 (CSC), originally established to support <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/254147.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">

 architecture was revolutionary for its time. The system consisted of a virtualizing control program (CP) which created multiple independent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/32353.xml">
virtual machine</link>s (VMs). <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/18311356.xml">
Virtualization</link> was possible because of two elements of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/7522024.xml">
IBM System/360-67</link>:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Segregation of privileged 'supervisor state' instructions from normal 'problem state' instructions</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Address translation hardware</entry>
</list>

When a program was running in '<link>
problem state</link>', using a privileged instruction or an invalid memory address would cause the hardware to raise an exception condition. By trapping these conditions, CP could simulate the appropriate behavior, e.g. performing I/O or paging operations. A guest operating system, which would run in '<link>
supervisor state</link>' on a bare machine, was run in '<link>
problem state</link>' under CP.</p>
<p>

The result was a fully-virtualized environment. Each virtual machine had its own set of virtual devices, mapped from the system's real hardware environment. (Thus a given dial-up teletype was presented to its VM instance as its <it>virtual console</it>.)</p>
<p>

Any S/360 operating system could in fact be run under CP, but normal users ran CMS (<it>Cambridge Monitor System</it>) &ndash; a simple, single-user operating system. CMS allowed users to run programs and manage their virtual devices. (Testing and development of CP itself was done by running a full copy of CP/CMS inside a single virtual machine. Some CP/CMS operating system work, such as CP-370 development and MVS testing, ran four- or five-level deep stacks of hardware and OS simulations.)</p>
<p>

The CP/CMS design was a departure from IBM's other monolithic operating systems. CP/CMS segregated complex "big system" problems (dispatching, hardware management, mass storage, etc.) from "little system" capabilities needed by a single user (application program execution, file I/O, console input/output, etc.). Each component was simpler as a result. Isolating users from each other improved system stability: a bug in one user's software could not crash another user's CMS, nor the underlying CP. This architecture would ultimately reach its apotheosis in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/20023.xml">
microkernel</link> operating systems. </p>
<p>

IBM's decision to implement these virtualization and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/32354.xml">
virtual memory</link> features in the subsequent S/370 design (although missing from the initial S/370 series) reflects the success of the <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
