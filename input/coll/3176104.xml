Newtrament started out working with a band, Krew, getting involved in the new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/9510.xml">
electronic music</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/3726.xml">
breakdancing</link>. In 1983, he recorded <it>London Bridge is Falling Down</it> (Jive, 1983). Although the pioneer of an entire genre of recorded music, Newtrament doesn't appear to have recorded anything else since then.
Newtrament used to squat houses in the <link>

 area in the early eighties. He pioneered the warehouse party along with a group known as KREW, consisting of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../507/656507.xml">
b-boys</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/11985.xml">
graffiti</link> artists, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../683/8683.xml">
DJs</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../421/25421.xml">
rappers</link> from the Powis Square area in Notting Hill. KREW stood for Kings Ruling Every Where. The name has its roots in graffiti writing, in which a king means a top writer. The KREW became entrenched in NY hip hop through their time living on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/32090.xml">
USAF</link> bases around the country. They also befriended DJ <disk_jockey wordnetid="110017272" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

 in 1982 on his first ever UK tour.</p>
<p>

The KREW were pioneers of the rapidly emerging UK Hip Hop scene. One member so much so. Dj Mono Man. Who befriended Dj Afrikka Bambatta who later became a  family friend. They played together in a few clubs around the country. Also Treach Dj Mr Mixx. The creator of the  Miami Bass sound and 2 live Crew. Who met Mono Man on one of his trips up to USAF Lakenheath. They became friends and started to experiment with different Dj'n  techniques. A few years later Miami Bass was born.He also rapped on "London Bridge is Falling Down."</p>
<p>

The Ladbroke Grove area of West London has always been an entertainment/media/arts/music/culture centre for the UK. And this was witnessed by the passing through of some of the now legends in Hip Hop.</p>
<p>

Rock Steady Crew: Hung with the KREW B Boys in Powis Square,doing their thing.
Futara 2000 : Stayed in Powis Square with Mick Jones from the Clash. Done the first ever UK Graffitti, under the Westway.
DJ Whizz Kid: Done a show at the then Acklam Hall. 
Spoonie G: Rappin' n' DJ'n with the KREW at thier Carnival party.
Wild Bunch: Who split to become Massive and super producer Nelle Hopper,early Hip Hop pioneers from Bristol, played/hosted warehouse  partys/jams with Newtrament and the KREW.</p>
<p>

Now days&#91;&#93; you can find newtrament chillin on melrose and fairfax. Newtrament skates his way down. These streets and has great knowledge of the streetwear Mecca. Newtrament still makes music on his keyboard in front of canters. When seen you must start a conversation with him and reallly see how intelligent and knowledgeable he is. Oh and keep your mcdonalds fries away from him because he will eat them up. - tonytones 
Afrikka Islam: Hangin' in the Grove with the Mighty Ethniczs, Sir Drew, MC Flexxwon. Making them Zulu Princes!!</p>
