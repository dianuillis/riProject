History</st>
<p>

Minnesota Life College is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/72487.xml">
non-profit</link> organization that was founded in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../636/34636.xml">
1996</link> by Bev and Roe Hatlen, co-founders of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../895/1661895.xml">

. One of the Hatlen's children had a learning disability, and upon graduation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/42556.xml">
high school</link> he had only a handful of schools like MLC to choose from, all scattered across the United States. It was at that time that the Hatlen's decided to start a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/14423.xml">
post-secondary</link> school for young adults with learning disabilities, since one did not already exist in <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

The program</st>

<p>

Minnesota Life College is an apartment living innovative life skills instructional program for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/167334.xml">
young adults</link> whose learning disabilities pose serious challenges to their independence. Minnesota Life College is not like a traditional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/19725260.xml">
University</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../689/5689.xml">
College</link>. The education the students at MLC receive has more to do with teaching life skills instead of contemporary educational subject matter. MLC stresses skill acquisition in independent living, social development, vocational readiness, decision-making, and fitness and wellness. All of this can be summed up in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../580/7623580.xml">
mission statement</link>:</p>
<p>

The Mission of Minnesota Life College is to prepare young adults with learning disabilities to achieve personal and financial self-sufficiency. </p>
<p>

The program at Minnesota Life College is split into three phases. The <it>Core Phase</it>, which is for first and second year students, the <it>Transition Phase</it>, which is for third year students, and the third phase, the <it>Graduate Living Program</it>. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
Core phase</st>
<p>

The core phase is the beginning of the program for all new students. During the core phase, students set individual goals based on an evaluation of their strengths, abilities and interests. Over the course of two years, the students begin to learn and practice self-management and social skills they may be lacking or having trouble in. Also during the core phase, students practice employment skills, fitness and nutrition, personal financial management, self-esteem building, and leadership opportunities. During the core phase, students live in a two-bedroom apartment that is shared with three other roommates.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Transition phase</st>
<p>

Upon completion of the core phase, students move into the transition phase. During the transition phase, students continue to practice the skills needed for healthy, independent living. Despite holding jobs, participating in internships, and/or attending a traditional postsecondary educational institution, transition students continue to live with MLC roommates on campus and maintain their involvement in MLC activities. After completion of the transition phase, students are considered to have graduated from Minnesota Life College.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Graduate living program</st>
<p>

Upon completion of the transition phase, Minnesota Life College graduates have gained the skills needed to live on their own. However, the graduate living program is an additional program for graduates who needed extra, more specific help and support. Graduates and their parents are able to select services such as job placement and job coaching, recreation and alumni activities, and case management. While participating in the graduate living program, graduates live independently on campus in apartments separate from the core and transition students.</p>

The experience</st>
<p>

Minnesota Life College offers its students much more than just a challenging class schedule. Fun and motivating activities, many planned by the students themselves, are an everyday part of life at MLC. </p>

 game, students have a wide variety of opportunities to develop lifelong friendships while enjoying new experiences. To ensure the health and wellness of the students, they are required to participate in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/432986.xml">
fitness</link> program at a local <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/7367299.xml">
health club</link> at least three times a week.</p>
<p>

At MLC, the "differences" that set the students apart in their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/230961.xml">
K-12</link> educational programs now become the common bond that brings them together. The students learn that others share similar challenges and, often for the first time, they gain the confidence it takes to succeed.</p>

Annual scholarship and programs benefit</st>


<p>

In 2004, MLC held its first benefit to raise money for the students and program.  Since then, once a year, usually at the end of April, MLC holds a benefit to raise money for the program.  The <it>Gala</it>, as it is commonly referred, raises money to help with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/180337.xml">
scholarships</link> for families in need of assistance, as well as support program costs.  It consists of both a <link>
