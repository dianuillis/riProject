The <b>Sandbox Effect</b> is a theory used to explain certain behaviours observed with the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. The Sandbox Effect is the theory that websites with newly-registered domains or domains with frequent ownership or nameserver changes are placed in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/1291932.xml">
sandbox</link> (holding area) in the indexes of Google until it is deemed appropriate before a ranking can commence.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Webmasters have claimed that their site will only show for keywords that are not competitive . It appears this effect does not affect new pages unless the domain is in the sandbox.</p>
<p>

There are many different opinions about it, including the view that the Sandbox Effect doesn't actually exist and that the search ranking behaviour can be explained as a result of a mathematical algorithm, rather than a decided policy .</p>
<p>

Those who believe the sandbox exists observe that it can sometimes take up to a year or longer for a website to be promoted from the Google sandbox, while those who do not believe in a sandbox explain this duration as simply the time it takes for Google to calculate PageRank using an "eigenpairs interpretation of nodes".</p>
<p>

Those who believe in the "sandbox effect" (such as Searchguild.com) consider it a "policies" based approach by Google, whereas some mathematicians believe it is simply an algorithmic effect.</p>
<p>

Regardless of interpretation, it is widely accepted that new Websites and Webpages do wait longer for ranking in Google than other search engines .</p>
<p>

It is observed that adding Adsense to a new website in the first few weeks of propagation will flag the website to Google and will expedite the Sandbox Effect and elongate the process where its Pagerank moves from a solid bar to PR-0 or more depending on its link popularity.</p>

<p>

Since Google is the dominant search engine on the Internet, this "sandbox effect" has distressed webmasters&#91;&#93; who see their websites included in Yahoo! and MSN in a short period of time, but not in Google despite following Google's own guidelines.</p>
<p>

It is thought, by some<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, that the sandbox is a measure taken by Google to avoid spam websites abusing search engine optimization techniques to reach the top of the index, getting barred by Google, and then repeating the process using a different domain. Yet another explanation is Google's "supplemental" index.</p>
<p>

Google's sandbox appeared to be put in place in March 2004.</p>
