<b>Malaxation</b>, a stage in the process of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../618/1925618.xml">
olive oil extraction</link>, is the action of slowly churning or mixing milled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">
olive</link>s in a specially designed mixer for 20 to 40 minutes.  The churning allows the smaller droplets of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
oil</link> released by the milling process to aggregate and be more easily separated. The paste is normally heated to around 27Â°C during this process. Oil yield is proportional to the temperature and mixing time. However, the use of higher temperatures and longer mixing times increases <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/66313.xml">
oxidation</link> of the oil and therefore decreases shelf life, so a compromise must be struck. Also, the usage of higher temperatures does not allow for the labelling of the oil as "cold extracted", a term used widely as a marketing tactic, especially in the <economy wordnetid="108366753" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

.<p>

It is now possible with newer equipment to use a blanket of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../159/248159.xml">
inert gas</link> such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/21175.xml">
nitrogen</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/5906.xml">
carbon dioxide</link> over the olive paste, which greatly reduces oxidation. This allows for an increased yield without compromising the quality of the oil.</p>
<p>

After malaxation is complete, the paste is then sent to a phase separator. Nearly all producers use a <link>
decanter centrifuge</link> for this process. Traditionally the olive oil was separated from the paste using a large press that was either screwed down or weighted with rocks.</p>
