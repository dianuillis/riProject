<b>Procedural knowledge</b> is the knowledge exercised in the performance of some task.  See below for the specific meaning of this term in <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/5961.xml">
cognitive psychology</link></b> and <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../724/14724.xml">
intellectual property</link></b> law.</p>
<p>

Procedural knowledge is different from other kinds of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../391/243391.xml">
knowledge</link>, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/5046664.xml">
declarative knowledge</link>, in that it can be directly applied to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/314110.xml">
task</link>. For instance, the procedural knowledge one uses to solve problems differs from the declarative knowledge one possesses about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../948/1467948.xml">
problem solving</link>. In some legal systems, such procedural knowledge has been considered the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../724/14724.xml">
intellectual property</link> of a company, and can be transferred when that company is purchased. </p>
<p>

One limitation of procedural knowledge is its job-dependence; thus it tends to be less general than declarative knowledge. For example, a computer expert might have <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../391/243391.xml">
knowledge</link> about a computer algorithm in multiple languages, or in pseudo-code, whereas a Visual Basic programmer might only know about a specific implementation of that algorithm, written in Visual Basic. Thus the 'hands-on' expertise and experience of the Visual Basic programmer might be of commercial value only to Microsoft job-shops, for example.</p>
<p>

One advantage of procedural knowledge is that it can involve more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../912/43912.xml">
sense</link>s, such as hands-on experience, practice at solving problems, understanding of the limitations of a specific solution, etc. Thus procedural knowledge can frequently eclipse theory.</p>

<p>

In <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link></b>, procedural knowledge is one type of knowledge that can be possessed by an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../317/2711317.xml">
intelligent agent</link>.  Such knowledge is often represented as a partial or complete  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/10931.xml">
finite-state machine</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/5783.xml">
computer program</link>.  A well-known example is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/8233911.xml">
Procedural Reasoning System</link>, which might, in the case of a mobile robot that navigates in a building, contain procedures such as "navigate to a room" or "plan a path".  In contrast, an AI system based on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/5046664.xml">
declarative knowledge</link> might just contain a map of the building, together with information about the basic actions that can be done by the robot (like moving forward, turning, and stopping), and leave it to a domain-independent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/1505641.xml">
planning algorithm</link> to discover how to use those actions to achieve the agent's goals.</p>

 Cognitive psychology </st>

<p>

In <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/5961.xml">
cognitive psychology</link></b>, procedural knowledge is the knowledge exercised in the accomplishment of a task, and thus includes knowledge which, unlike <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/5046664.xml">
declarative knowledge</link>, cannot be easily articulated by the individual, since it is typically nonconscious (or tacit).  For example, most individuals can easily recognize a specific face as "attractive" or a specific joke as "funny," but they cannot explain how exactly they arrived at that conclusion or they cannot provide a working definition of "attractiveness" or being "funny."  This example illustrates the difference between procedural knowledge and the ordinary notion of knowing how, a distinction which is acknowledged by many cognitive psychologists (Stillings, et al. Cognitive Science: An Introduction, 2nd edition, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995, p. 396).  Ordinarily, we would not say that one who is able to recognize a face as attractive is one who knows how to recognize a face as attractive. One knows how to recognize faces as attractive no more than one knows how to recognize certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables. Recognizing faces as attractive, like recognizing certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables, is simply something that one does, or is able to do. It is, therefore, an instance of procedural knowledge, though it is not an instance of know-how. Of course, both forms of knowledge are, in many cases, nonconscious. For instance, research by a cognitive psychologist <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 has demonstrated that procedural knowledge can be acquired by nonconscious processing of information about covariations.</p>

 Intellectual property law </st>

<p>

In <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../724/14724.xml">
intellectual property</link></b> law, procedural knowledge is a parcel of closely-held information relating to industrial technology, sometimes also referred to as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../960/29960.xml">
trade secret</link> which enables its user to derive commercial benefit from it. It is a component of the intellectual property rights on its own merits in most legislations but most often accompanies the license to the right-of-use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/23273.xml">
patent</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/18935023.xml">
trademark</link>s owned by the party releasing it for circumscribed use. Procedural knowledge is not however solely composed of secret information that is not in the public domain; it is a "bundled" parcel of secret and related non-secret information which would be novel to an expert in the field of its usage.</p>
