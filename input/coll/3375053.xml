DU has become a leader in habitat preservation and has conserved more than 11.6 million acres (46,900 km²) of waterfowl habitat in North America. DU partners with a wide range of corporations, governments, other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../142/3742142.xml">
NGO</link>'s, landowners, and private citizens to restore and manage areas that have been damaged and to prevent further degradation of existing wetlands. DU is also active in working with others to recommend government policies that will positively influence wetlands and the environment. DU generates $200M in revenues each year, 87% of which goes directly towards habitat conservation. Their sources of revenue include Federal and State habitat reimbursements (32%), conservation easements (27%), sponsors and members (25%), major gifts and donations (11%) and royalties/advertisement (5%). By its efforts DU attempts to benefit biodiversity, water quality, the environment, and the economy in the areas in which it is active.</p>
<p>

Ducks Unlimited, in keeping with its founders intentions, also promotes the continuation of safe and regulated waterfowl hunting. The majority of DU's financial contributors and members are waterfowl hunters. And over ninety percent of those who read DU magazine are hunters. The DU magazine contains many historical and practical articles on waterfowl hunting, and it obtains revenue from advertisements of waterfowling equipment such as shotguns, ammunition, decoys, and bird calls.</p>

Conservation</st>
<p>

Traditionally, most DU wetland conservation projects were conducted in the Canadian prairies by its subsidiary, Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC). DUC has however expanded its operations to include projects in every Canadian province and territory. As of 2007, DUC has conserved 51,000 km² (12.5 million acres) of wetland habitat, while working in partnership with 17,200 landowners. DU has also expanded its operations to include many conservation projects in the United States, including the restoration of duck breeding habitat, mostly in the northern central states; and also duck overwintering habitat, mostly in the coastal and southern states and in <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

Methods</st>

<p>

Ducks Unlimited places strong emphasis on its belief in science and research.  They work closely with biologists and ecologists to evaluate habitat needs and to monitor how birds respond to various environmental changes.   Some of the methods used by Ducks Unlimited to conserve habitats are:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Restoring Grasslands: grasslands are used to protect waterfowl from predators and serve as a natural concealment for nests.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Replanting Forests: 80% of forested land has been cleared and natural flooding has been reduced by 50 – 90%.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Restoring Watersheds: when watersheds are disturbed, contaminants wash into wetlands and disrupt the plants, fish and animals. DU utilizes buffer strips to protect stream corridors and filter contaminants out.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Educating Landowners: promoting economic viability while being conservative of resources.   An example is the planting of winter wheat, which is planted in the fall and undisturbed while ducks are nesting in fields.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Conservation Easements: areas of land purchased by DU from private landowners. The land owner maintains actual ownership of the land, but agrees to never drain, fill, level or burn it.  Since 75% of U.S. wetlands are on private property, conservation easements play a crucial role in the conservation movement.</entry>
</list>
</p>

Acquiring Land: the direct purchase of wetlands</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Ducks Unlimited is also working closely with U.S. Congress, the Administration, conservation leaders, private landowners and farmers to ensure that environmental provisions are contained in the 2007 Farm Bill.  The Farm Bill supports programs such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/4632770.xml">
Conservation Reserve Program</link> (CRP) and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../588/8589588.xml">
Wetlands Reserve Program</link> (WRP).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Regions of Special Interest</st>

<p>

Ducks Unlimited funds are utilized to conserve and protect areas where habitats are either disappearing or in danger of disappearing.  The following areas are considered to be the three most endangered in North America and are at the top of DU's priority list:</p>

<ss3>
<st>
Prairie Pothole Region</st>

<p>

Over 10,000 years ago, melting glaciers created millions of depressions in the land throughout what is now the Great Plains of North America.   These depressions hold water and grasses and constitute wetland habitat for millions of migratory ducks and geese.  Increased agricultural development has caused these wetlands to drain, resulting in the disappearance of 194,000 acres (785 km²) since 1984. DU relies heavily on conservation easements in the <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">
<location wordnetid="100027167" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/5736979.xml">

</region>
 to counteract habitat losses, and plans to protect an additional 150,000 acres (607 km²) through land acquisitions. The Prairie Pothole Region is the most threatened of the twenty-five waterfowl habits on the continent.</p>

</ss3>
<ss3>
<st>
Central Valley/Coastal California</st>

<p>

This area spans from San Francisco to Northern Mexico and constitutes habitat for 60% of the <location wordnetid="100027167" confidence="0.8">

’s wintering waterfowl.  Rapid urbanization and water shortages have been contributing factors in the loss of habitat in this area. The Central Valley/Coastal California region is considered number two of the twenty five most threatened waterfowl habitats on the continent.</p>

</ss3>
<ss3>
<st>
Western Boreal Forest – Canada</st>

<p>

The world’s largest land-based ecosystem, the Western Boreal Forest covers two thirds of Canada and contains a quarter of the world’s remaining original forests.  Millions of migratory birds breed here, including 40% of the regional duck population.  Habitats have been damaged by overdevelopment, agriculture, climate changes, dams and oil and mineral extractions. In 1997, DU founded the Western Boreal Forest Initiative aimed at conserving wetlands and habitats.</p>

Sporting Conservation Council</st>
<p>

In March 2006, the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/70904.xml">

 announced the formation of the Sporting Conservation Council.   The council will provide input in regards to forest health, habitat restoration/protection and the impact of energy development on wildlife resources. As explained by Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, “dating back to <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, hunters have been the pillar of conservation in America, doing more than anyone to conserve wildlife and its habitat.  This new advisory council will provide a formal mechanism for the department to benefit from the expertise of sportsmen and women as well as become aware of their concerns as we develop federal policies.” The council is made up of representatives from various hunting groups, including the National Wild Turkey Federation, Ducks Unlimited and the <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Criticism</st>

<p>

Ducks Unlimited was founded by waterfowl hunters intent on preserving their recreational interests, and remains to this day a pro-hunting organization. Some other environmental groups and anti-hunting lobbyists have consequently had a historically difficult relationship with DU. These groups accuse DU of simply breeding ducks to be shot. Supporters counter that many species live in the habitat restored and protected by DU dollars, not just game birds, and DU continues to complete many more successful conservation projects than do its detractors. Furthermore, supporters contend it would be unrealistic to expect that the money for wetland conservation would be forthcoming if waterfowl had no recreational value to hunters. </p>
<p>

Difficulties came to a head in the 1980s when DU Canada proceeded to construct their national headquarters on the shore of <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.8">
<region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

, a critical wildlife habitat. Critics said that the traffic and noise associated with the building would disrupt the wildlife. However, the marsh is not a natural one, and was in fact recreated out of marginal farmland by Ducks Unlimited themselves. And the building is also an education and interpretive center, introducing many school children and adults to the ecology of the marsh habitat. The wildlife have also gotten used to the building and its people, as its roof has become a popular nesting spot and deer frequent the grounds.</p>
