A <b>system architecture</b> or <b>systems architecture</b> is the <b>conceptual</b> design that defines the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/93545.xml">
structure</link> and/or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/4805.xml">
behavior</link> of a <link>
system.</link> There is no universally agreed definition of which aspects constitute a system architecture, and various organizations define it in different ways, including:<p>

“An architecture description is a formal description of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structural properties of the system. It defines the [system] components or building blocks...and provides a plan from which products can be procured, and systems developed, that will work together to implement the overall system. It thus enables you to manage...investment in a way that meets [business] needs...” (TOGAF)</p>
<p>

Systems architecture can best be thought of as a representation of an existent (or To Be Created) system, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/4746766.xml">
process</link> and discipline for effectively implementing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../560/8560.xml">
design</link>(s) for such a system.  The set of relations (that is, embedded information) which an architecture describes may be expressed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../615/13615.xml">
hardware</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/5309.xml">
software</link>, or something else (for example, <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

metadescription</link>).  </p>
<p>

It is a <b>representation</b> because it is used to convey the informational content of the  comprising a system, the relationships among those elements, and the  governing those relationships.</p>
<p>

It is a <b>process</b> because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or change the architecture, and/or a design from that architecture, of a system within a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/454886.xml">
set</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../360/206360.xml">
constraints</link>.</p>
<p>

It is a <b>discipline</b> because a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../788/3788.xml">
body</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../391/243391.xml">
knowledge</link> is used to inform <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../499/13028499.xml">
practitioner</link>s as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints.</p>
<p>

A systems architecture is primarily concerned with the internal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/620746.xml">
interface</link>s among the system's  or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/8286675.xml">
subsystem</link>s, and the interface  between the system and its external environment, especially the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/16301990.xml">
user</link>.  (In the specific case of computer systems, this latter, special interface, is known as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/45249.xml">
computer human interface</link>, <it>AKA</it> human computer interface, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../516/13516.xml">
CHI</link>; formerly called the man-machine interface.)</p>

<sec>
<st>
Background</st>
<p>

It is important to keep in mind that the modern systems architecture did not appear on the scene out of nowhere.  Systems architecture depends heavily on practices and techniques which were developed over thousands of years in many other fields most importantly being, perhaps, civil architecture.</p>
<p>

Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the term system as it is still commonly used today.  However, with the arrival of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/7878457.xml">
digital computers</link> on the scene and the development of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/27010.xml">
software engineer</link>ing as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts, software artifacts, and the combined artifacts.  A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/5783.xml">
programmable</link> hardware artifact, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/7878457.xml">
computing machine</link>, that lacks its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/5783.xml">
software program</link> is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine.  However, a hardware machine and its software program can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks.  Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the term system came to be defined as containing all of the elements necessary (which generally includes both hardware and software) to perform a useful function.</p>
<p>

Consequently, within these engineering disciplines, a system generally refers to a programmable hardware machine and its included program. And a systems engineer is defined as one concerned with the complete device, both hardware and software and, more particularly, all of the interfaces of the device, including that between hardware and software, and especially between the complete device and its user (the CHI).  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../465/3561465.xml">
hardware engineer</link> deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/27010.xml">
software engineer</link> deals (more or less) exclusively with the software program; and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../764/27764.xml">
systems engineer</link> is responsible for seeing that the software program is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function.</p>
<p>

By analogy, then, a systems architecture makes use of elements of both software and hardware and is used to enable design of such a composite system.  A good architecture may be viewed as a 'partitioning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/364754.xml">
scheme</link>,' or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>, which partitions all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../835/13076835.xml">
workable</link> set of cleanly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/1504642.xml">
bounded</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/8286675.xml">
subsystem</link>s with nothing left over.  That is, it is a partitioning scheme which is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../703/400703.xml">
exclusive</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/400700.xml">
inclusive</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/303716.xml">
exhaustive</link>.  A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the subsystems so that there is a minimum of communications needed among them.  In both software and hardware, a good subsystem tends to be seen to be a meaningful "object."  Moreover, a good architecture provides for an easy mapping to the user's requirements and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/13144608.xml">
validation tests</link> of the user's requirements.  Ideally, a mapping also exists from every least element to every requirement and test.</p>
<p>

A <b>robust architecture</b> is said to be one that exhibits an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../779/225779.xml">
optimal</link> degree of  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../729/2573729.xml">
fault-tolerance</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/4459.xml">
backward compatibility</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../972/305972.xml">
forward compatibility</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/1617522.xml">
extensibility</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/41651.xml">
reliability</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/41347.xml">
maintainability</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../760/40760.xml">

quality attributes</link> as necessary and/or desirable.</p>
