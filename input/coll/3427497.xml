<b>Terminal Illness Insurance</b> (known as <b>Accelerated Death benefit</b> in <system wordnetid="108435388" confidence="0.8">

) pays out a capital sum if the policyholder is diagnosed with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../395/712395.xml">
terminal illness</link> from which the policyholder is expected to die within 12 months of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/18507525.xml">
diagnosis</link>, by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/23315.xml">
physician</link> who specialises in that illness or condition. <p>

Terminal Illness Insurance is a form of insurance that is often added to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/383367.xml">
life insurance</link> policy or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../302/3418302.xml">
Mortgage Life Insurance</link> policy by the insurance company issuing the policy. Terminal Illness Insurance is not available as a separate insurance policy. </p>
<p>

If a life insurance policyholder also has terminal illness insurance, then he/she has the benefit of knowing that if he/she is diagnosed with a serious illness and is expected to die within 12 months of diagnosis, then the combined policy will pay out straight away rather than waiting for the policyholder to pass away (as would happen if the policyholder did not have terminal illness insurance).</p>
<p>

Do not confuse terminal illness insurance with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/3417428.xml">
critical illness insurance</link>. The two forms of insurance are very different.</p>
