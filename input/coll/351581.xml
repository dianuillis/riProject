Medical informatics began to take off in the US in the 1950s with the rise of the microchip and computers.</p>
<p>

Early names for medical informatics included  medical computing, medical computer science, computer medicine, medical electronic data processing, medical automatic data processing, medical information processing, medical information science, medical software engineering, and medical computer technology.</p>

In the 1970s a growing number of commercial vendors began to market practice management and electronic medical records systems. Although many products exists only a small number of health practitioners use fully featured electronic health care records systems.</p>

HIPAA</link> of 1996, regulating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../009/25009.xml">

physicians</link> to move towards using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/930653.xml">
EMR</link> software, primarily for the purpose of secure medical billing.</p>
<p>

The US is making progress towards a standardized health information infrastructure. In 2004 the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) formed the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, headed by David J. Brailer, M.D., Ph.D.  The mission of this office is widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) in the US within 10 years. See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/1666023.xml">
quality improvement organizations</link> for more information on federal initiatives in this area. Brailer resigned from the post in April, 2006. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

European health informatics</st>
<p>

The European Union's Member States are committed to sharing their best practices and experiences to create a European eHealth Area, thereby improving access to and quality healthcare at the same time as stimulating growth in a promising new industrial sector. The European eHealth Action Plan plays a fundamental role in the European Union's strategy. Work on this initiative involves a collaborative approach among several parts of the Commission services.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>.

<p>

In the United Kingdom, moves towards registration and regulation of those involved in Health Informatics have begun with the formation of the UK Council for Health Informatics Professions (UKCHIP).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

The NHS in England has also contracted out to several vendors for a National Medical Informatics system '<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/1515790.xml">
NPFIT</link>' that divides the country into five regions and is to be united by a central electronic medical record system nicknamed "the spine" <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>.  The project, in 2006, is well behind schedule and its scope and design are being revised in real time.</p>
<p>

In 2006, 60% of residents in England and Wales have more or less extensive clinical records and their prescriptions generated on 4000 installations of one system (EMIS) written in 'M' (MUMPS as was).  The other 40% predominantly have records stored on assorted SQL or file-based systems.</p>
<p>

Scotland has a similar approach to central connection under way which is more advanced than the English one in some ways.</p>
<p>

Scotland has the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../086/5198086.xml">
GPASS</link> system whose source code is owned by the State, and controlled and developed by NHS Scotland.  It has been provided free to all GPs in Scotland but has developed poorly<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>.  Discussion of open sourcing it as a remedy is occurring.</p>

The European Commission's preference, as exemplified in the 5th Framework, is for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for healthcare.</p>

This system has been deployed at all the sites of the Authority (40 hospitals and 120 clinics), and is used by all 30,000 clinical staff on a daily basis, with a daily transaction of up to 2 millions.  The comprehensive records of 7 million patients are available on-line in the Electronic Patient Record (ePR), with data integrated from all sites.  Since 2004 radiology image viewing has been added to the ePR, with radiography images from any HA site being available as part of the ePR.</p>

Healthcare Management Informatics</st>
<p>

<it>Healthcare Management Informatics</it> (HMI) can be defined as that subset of health informatics dedicated to the study, design and implementation of information technology solutions in support of the practice of healthcare management in all its forms - including, but not limited to, primary care and general practice, sub acute and rehabilitation care, and hospital care. Furthermore, HMI involves the study of the needs of healthcare management practitioners, including in information presentation and in decision support. The Australasian based Special Interest Group in Healthcare Management Informatics and Computing (SHMIC), hosted as a web based group, has a specific focus on this topic, and has members from multiple disciplines from across the Australian and Asian regions interested in developing further the discipline of HMI.</p>

Health informatics law</st>
<p>

<it>Health informatics law</it> deals with evolving and sometimes complex legal principles as they apply to information technology in health-related fields. It addresses the privacy, ethical and operational issues that invariably arise when electronic tools, information and media are used in health care delivery. Health Informatics Law also applies to all matters that involve information technology, health care and the interaction of information. It deals with the circumstances under which data and records are shared with other fields or areas that support and enhance patient care.</p>
