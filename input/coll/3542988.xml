As of 2000, oil and gas exports accounted for more than 98% of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/307592.xml">
export earnings</link> and about 83% of federal government revenue, as well as generating more than 40% of its GDP. It also provides 95% of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/648277.xml">

, but off-shore rigs are also prominent in the well-endowed coastal region. Nigeria is one of the few major oil-producing nations still capable of increasing its oil output and unlike most of the other OPEC countries, Nigeria is not projected to exceed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/601621.xml">
peak production</link> until at least 2009. The reason for Nigeria's relative unproductivity is primarily OPEC regulations on production in order to regulate prices on the international market. More recently, production has been forced to a halt intermittently by the demands and actions of the Niger Delta's inhabitants who feel they are being exploited.

 or "South-south" region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields. Most of Nigeria's oil fields are small and scattered, and as of 1990, these small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1% of all Nigerian production. This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9% of Nigeria's petroleum at that time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> As a result of the numerous small fields, an extensive and well-developed pipeline network has been engineered to transport the crude. Also due to the lack of highly productive fields, money from the jointly operated (with the federal government) companies is constantly directed towards petroleum exploration and production.</p>
<p>

Much of Nigeria's petroleum is classified as "light" or "sweet", meaning the oil is largely free of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../127/27127.xml">
sulphur</link>. Nigeria is the largest producer of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../606/1026606.xml">

. This crude oil is known as "Bonny light". Names of other Nigerian crudes, all of which are named according to export terminal, are Qua Ibo, Escravos blend, Brass river, Forcados, and Pennington Anfan.</p>
<p>

In terms of exportation, the U.S. remains Nigeria's largest customer for crude oil, accounting for 40% of the country's total oil exports; Nigeria provides about 10% of overall U.S. oil imports and ranks as the fifth-largest source for U.S. imported oil.</p>
<p>

There are six petroleum exportation terminals in the country, Shell owns two, while Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, and Agip own one each.  Shell also owns the Forcados Terminal, which is capable of storing 13&nbsp;million barrels (2,100,000&nbsp;m3) of crude oil in conjunction with the nearby Bonny Terminal.

Deepwater Drilling</p>
<p>

An industry that is developing and has potential to strengthen the future for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
oil</link> extraction in Africa is deepwater production.  This is mainly underwater oil drilling that exists 400 m or more below the surface of the water.  By expanding to deep water drilling the possible sources for finding new oil reserves is expanded.  Through the introduction of deep water drilling 50% more oil is extracted than before the new forms of retrieving the oil <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.  <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../383/21383.xml">
Nigeria</link></country>
 are the largest oil producers in Africa.  In Nigeria the deepwater sector still has a large avenue to expand and develop.  The amount of oil extracted from Nigeria is expected to expand from 15,000&nbsp;bbl/d (2,400&nbsp;m³/d) in 2003 to 1.27&nbsp;Mbbl/d (202,000&nbsp;m³/d) in 2010 <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.  Deepwater drilling for oil is especially attractive to oil companies because the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/21387.xml">
Nigerian government</link> has very little share in these activities, so it is hard for them to place restrictions and regulations on the companies <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.  Also, the deepwater extraction plants limit the amount of interruptions in production by local militant attacks, seizures due to civil conflicts, and sabotage <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.  These advancements offer more resources and alternatives to extract the oil from the Niger Delta, with hopefully less conflict than the operations on land.</p>

 Natural gas </st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../131/22131.xml">
Natural gas</link> reserves are well over 100 trillion ft³ (2,800 km³), the gas reserves are three times as substantial as the crude oil reserves.  The biggest natural gas initiative is the Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas Company, which is operated jointly by several companies and the state.  It began exploration and production in 1999. Chevron is also attempting to create the Escravos Gas Utilization project which will be capable of producing 160 million standard ft³ of gas per day.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Nigeria's total petroleum refining capacity is 445&nbsp;million barrels per day (70,700,000&nbsp;m³/d), however, only 240,000&nbsp;bbl/d (38,000&nbsp;m³/d) was allotted during the 1990s.  Subsequently crude oil production for refineries was reduced further to as little as 75,000&nbsp;bbl/d (11,900&nbsp;m³/d) during the regime of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../443/392443.xml">
Sanni Abacha</link>.  There are four major oil refineries: the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Plant which can process 125&nbsp;million barrels (19,900,000&nbsp;m3) of crude per day, the New Port Harcourt Refinery which can produce 150&nbsp;million barrels per day (24,000,000&nbsp;m³/d) (there is also an 'Old' Port Harcourt Refinery with negligible production), as well as the now defunct Kaduna Refinery.  The Port Harcourt and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../774/564774.xml">

It is estimated that demand and consumption of petroleum in Nigeria grows at a rate of 12.8% annually.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> However, petroleum products are unavailable to most Nigerians and are quite costly, because almost all of the oil extracted by the multinational oil companies is refined overseas, while only a limited quantity is supplied to Nigerians themselves.</p>

Even before the consolidation of British control over all of present day Nigeria's borders in 1914 from the protectorates of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/1182783.xml">
Southern</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/1160619.xml">

. The company was crucial in securing most of Nigeria's major ports and monopolized coastal trade; this resulted in the severing of ties which linked the area to the flourishing West African regional trade network, in favor of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/307592.xml">

Most of the population eventually abandoned food production for such market-dependent crops (peanuts and cotton in the north, palm oil in the east, and cocoa in the west).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> From the beginning divide and rule tactics were employed by both traders and administrators by highlighting ethno-religious differences and playing groups against one another.

Interest in Nigerian oil originated in 1914 with an ordinance making any oil and mineral under Nigerian soil legal property of the Crown. By 1938 the colonial government had granted the state-sponsored company, Shell (then known as Shell D'Arcy) monopoly over exploration of all minerals and petroleum throughout the entire colony.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> Commercially viable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">

, the prospect emerged of the Eastern Region gaining self-sufficiency and increasing prosperity. The exclusion of easterners from power caused many in the east to fear that oil revenues would be used to benefit areas in the north and west rather than their own. The desire to accrue profits from oil revenues combined with ethnic tensions acted as a catalyst for the Igbo-spearheaded secession. Additionally, despite his denials in later years, it appears that Ojukwu's insistence on secession at the time was heavily influenced by his knowledge of the extent of the area's oil reserves.</p>
<p>

On top of scores of deaths, the war had a largely negative impact on the oil industry. Strife caused production of crude to drop significantly, particularly in Biafra. Total crude output decreased from 420&nbsp;million barrels per day (67,000,000&nbsp;m³/d) in 1966 at the start of the war, to only 140,000&nbsp;bbl/d (22,000&nbsp;m³/d) in 1968. Shell alone saw a drop from 367,000&nbsp;bbl/d (58,300&nbsp;m³/d) in 1966, to 43,000 in 1968. And in addition to concerns about production, oil companies began experiencing uncertainty as to the future of their investments depending on who prevailed in the war. This led to relations between oil companies and the federal government becoming strained, with the government at one point accusing the oil company Safrap (now <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../161/804161.xml">

oil industry</link>, and the government confined its financial involvement in the oil industry to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
taxes</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/305567.xml">
royalties</link> on the oil companies. The companies were subsequently able to set their own price on the petroleum they extracted, and dominated petroleum to such a point that laws governing the oil sector were having a negative effect on Nigerian interests. However,  even during the conflict with Biafra would force changes to the relationship between federal government and the petroleum industry. Gowon's military government instituted the 1969 Petroleum Decree which dismantled the existing revenue allocation system that had divided revenue from oil taxes equally between federal and state government, instead favoring an allocation formula in which the federal government controlled the dispensation of revenues to the states.</p>

After the loss of 300,000 lives, the war concluded in 1970 and resulted in a victory for the Nigerian state, as the secessionist regions were subsequently brought back into the Nigerian fold.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> However, the former Eastern Region had been split into two new states, <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 and South-Eastern (now Cross River) in order to discourage lingering ideas of independence. Following the war, Delta peoples and their lands, with their vast petroleum reserves came to be seen by many in the Nigerian government as colonies of sorts. As a result these groups, notably the Igbo, have to an extent been marginalized in Nigerian politics since this time, whilst Nigeria's long line of military rulers have reaped immense profits from their land. Indeed, Nigeria has not had an Igbo head of state since the war's end.</p>

In May 1971 the Nigerian federal government, then under the control of General <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../393/558393.xml">

, nationalized the oil industry by creating the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/3950337.xml">
Nigerian National Oil Corporation</link> via a decree. Following the war with Biafra, the government felt it necessary to secure and gain more control over the oil industry. Nationalization of the oil sector was also precipitated by Nigeria's desire to join <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/166346.xml">
OPEC</link>, which required that member states acquire 51% stake and become increasingly involved in the oil sector. Although the Nigerian government had maintained involvement in the industry prior to 1971, this was accomplished mainly through business deals on concessions of the foreign firms in operation. The creation of the NNOC made government participation in the industry legally binding. The federal government would continue to consolidate its oil involvement throughout the next several decades.</p>

 states, where the stakes for control of the immense oil resources are very high. At the federal level, political elites have utilized patronage to consolidate power for the ruling government, not only by rewarding their political friends in the federal government, but also by paying off major interest groups at the state or tribal level in order to elicit their cooperation.

Following the NNOC's genesis, the Nigerian government persisted in garnering control over oil revenues, in 1972 it declared that all property not currently owned by a foreign entity is legally the property of the government, which gained jurisdiction of the sale and allocation of concessions to foreign investment. The military regime oversaw the implementation of a number of other important milestones related to oil:</p>
<p>

1974: Participation in oil industry by government increases to 55 percent.</p>
<p>

1975: Decree 6 increases federal government share in oil sector to 80%, with only 20% going to states.</p>
<p>

1976: First exploration and development venture by NNOC undertaken and drills to uncover commercial quantities of petroleum off-shore.</p>
<p>

1978: Perhaps most importantly, the federal government created the Land Use Act which vested control over state lands in control of military governors appointed by the federal military regime, and eventually led to Section 40(3) of the 1979 constitution which declared all minerals, oil, natural gas, and natural resources found within the bounds of Nigeria to be legal property of the Nigerian federal government.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> </p>
<p>

, an entity which would exert more power over the allocation and sale of concessions than the NNOC. By 1979, the NNPC had also gained 60 percent participation in the oil industry.</p>

Attempted democracy and debt (1979-1983)</st>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../067/551067.xml">
Shehu Shagari</link></president>
. This event coincided with the declaration of Nigeria's Second Republic. At this juncture, the oil producing states of the Niger Delta were accounting for 82% of all federal government revenue but the population of these areas received very little compensation and demands for adequate reimbursement for the black gold extracted from their land could be heard at this time. Overall, petroleum accounted for 96% of all government external revenue but a mere 27% of the nation's GDP. However, the conversion to democracy would not improve the situation. </p>
<p>

A 1982 Revenue Act implemented by the Shagari government would eventually be modified by yet another military regime in 1984 via Decree 36 which reduced government share of oil revenue from 80% to 55%. 32.5% go to states and 10% to local governments.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> The remaining 1.5% was earmarked as a special fund to develop oil producing areas, however, it was during the Shagari regime that corruption in Nigerian governance reached its zenith and capital flight out of Nigeria peaked, while the oil-producing peoples continued to receive little to no share of the oil profits Additionally, 1980 saw oil-generated revenues attain an all-time climax of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/18717338.xml">
US</link> $24.9 billion but Nigeria still managed an international debt of $9 billion.</p>
<p>

Shagari's NPN government was viewed by the majority of Nigerians as incorrigibly corrupt by the time the national elections of 1983 came about. Shagari and his subordinates steadily transformed Nigeria into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../466/19334466.xml">
police state</link> where Nigerian military and police forces were permitted to utilise force quite liberally in order to control the civilian population. Such repressive measures were employed to ensure victory in the forthcoming elections, and this outcome was achieved largely through the bankrupting of the federal government's treasury.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> </p>
<p>

Another disturbing trend had also been gaining steam in Nigeria since the early 1970s: a steep drop in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/627.xml">
agricultural production</link> correlating roughly with the rise in federal revenues from petroleum extraction. Whereas previously Nigeria had been the world's lead exporter of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/54229.xml">
cocoa</link>, production of this <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/323990.xml">
cash crop</link> dropped by 43%, while productivity in other important income generators like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../393/38393.xml">
rubber</link> (29%), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../602/55602.xml">
groundnuts</link> (64%), and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/36806.xml">
cotton</link> (65%) plummeted as well between 1972 and 1983.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> The decline in agricultural production was not limited to cash crops amid the oil boom, and national output of staple foodstuffs fell. This situation contrasts to Nigeria in 1960 just after independence, when despite British underdevelopment, the nation was more or less self-sufficient in terms of food supply, while crops made up 97% of all revenue from exports. The drop in production was so substantial that by the early 1980s the NPN government was forced to implement a now notorious import license scheme which essentially involved Nigeria, for the first time in its history, importing basic food items.

</president>
, stole power and again alleged that his predecessors were corrupt violators of human rights and promised to rectify the situation, committing to a return to democracy by 1990. Nigeria had been saddled with a crushingly large international debt at this point. This was because, despite over 101 billion <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/18717338.xml">
US dollars</link> having been generated by the oil industry between  1958 and 1983,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> nearly all of these funds had been siphoned into the private bank accounts and the state sponsored pet projects maintained by the succession of Nigerian governmental elites.</p>
<p>

Immediately prior to Babangida's rise to power, which is viewed by some as having been orchestrated by international oil and banking interests, the <central_bank wordnetid="108349916" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/15251.xml">

 was exerting increasingly acute pressure on the Nigerian government to repay its massive debts, of which 44% of all federal revenue was already servicing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> Therefore, it was unsurprising when Babangida implemented the IMF's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/1374927.xml">
Structural Adjustment Program</link> in October 1986 in order to facilitate debt repayment. The SAP was extremely controversial while it was in effect between 1986 and 1988.  While it did permit Nigerian exports to become more competitive internationally and spurred a degree of economic growth, the SAP also incurred a dramatic drop in real wages for the majority of Nigerians. This, combined with major cuts to important public services, incited public unrest so extreme that Babangida's <politics wordnetid="113840719" confidence="0.8">

The 1980s military juntas conducted several attempted re-organisations of the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 to increase its efficiency. However, according to most sources by the early 1990s the NNPC was characterized by chronic inefficiency and waste. Red tape and poor organization are standard, with the NNPC being divided into several sub-entities, each fulfilling a particular function. This is despite the NNPC's growing participation in the industry, including development and exploration of numerous off-shore wells. As a result, the functionality of the industry is dependent on foreign corporations, not the NNPC.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The sudden jump in oil prices caused by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../000/182000.xml">
First Gulf War</link> in 1990 and 1991, as most researchers confirm, was at best squandered. The Babangida junta has been widely accused of "mismanaging" the oil windfall from the Gulf War price jump, which accounted for about $12.5 billion in revenues. Another alleges that the federal government siphoned off about $12.2 billion between 1988 and 1994 into private accounts or expenditures, "clandestinely undertaken while the country was openly reeling with a crushing external debt".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Under these circumstances, Babangida eventually allowed for nationwide elections on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/15806.xml">
June 12</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/34598.xml">

These elections were declared universally free and fair (at least in comparison to past elections) by all major international election monitors, and the eventual winner of the presidential race was the Chief M.K.O.

However, the military regime cynically pronounced the election, in which fourteen million Nigerians participated, to be null and void due to "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/382165.xml">

Throughout the early 1990s such popular unrest grew steadily, particularly in the Niger Delta region, where various ethnic groups began demanding compensation for years of ecological damage as well as control over their land's oil resources.

joint ventures</link> between foreign multi-national corporations and the Nigerian federal government. This joint venture manifests itself as the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, a nationalized state corporation. All companies operating in Nigeria obey government operational rules and naming conventions (companies operating in Nigeria must legally be sub-entities of the main corporation, often incorporating "Nigeria" into its name). Joint ventures account for approximately 95 percent of all crude oil output, while local independent companies operating in marginal fields account for the remaining 5 percent. Additionally, the Nigerian constitution states that all <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../053/19053.xml">

Oil spillage has a major impact on the ecosystem into which it is released. Immense tracts of the mangrove forests, which are especially susceptible to oil (this is mainly because it is stored in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/37738.xml">
soil</link> and re-released annually with inundation), have been destroyed. An estimated 5-10% of Nigerian mangrove ecosystems have been wiped out either by settlement or oil. The rainforest which previously occupied some 7,400&nbsp;km² of land has disappeared as well.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

Spills in populated areas often spread out over a wide area, taking out crops and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/1634.xml">
aquaculture</link>s through contamination of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/262927.xml">
groundwater</link> and soils. Though the consumption of dissolved oxygen by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/9028799.xml">
bacteria</link> feeding on the spilled hydrocarbons also contributes to the death of fishes. In agricultural communities, often a year's supply of food can be destroyed by only a minor leak, debilitating the farmers and their families who depend on the land for their livelihood. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../725/198725.xml">
Drinking water</link> is also frequently contaminated, and a sheen of oil is visible in many localized bodies of water. If the drinking water is contaminated, even if no immediate health effects are apparent, the numerous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/13257.xml">
hydrocarbons</link> and chemicals present in oil are highly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/6445.xml">
carcinogenic</link>. Although, people often do manifest sickness following consumption of polluted water. </p>
<p>

Offshore spills, which are usually much greater in scale, contaminate coastal environments and cause a decline in local fishing production.</p>
<p>

The decline in ecologic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../531/18413531.xml">
sustainability</link> parallels the increase in oil production since operations began four decades ago. Furthermore, operating companies such as Shell have made public proposals for increasing production significantly in the near future which, because of the careless nature of oil operations in the Delta, will cause the environment to grow increasingly uninhabitable.</p>

Nigeria flares more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../131/22131.xml">
natural gas</link> associated with oil extraction than any other country on the planet, with estimates suggesting that of the 3.5 billion&#32;cubic feet (99,000,000&nbsp;m3) of associated gas (AG) produced annually, 2.5 billion&#32;cubic feet (71,000,000&nbsp;m3), or about 70% is wasted via flaring. This equals about 25% of the UK's total natural gas consumption, and is the equivalent to 40% of the entire African continent's gas consumption in 2001. All statistical data associated with <link>
gas flaring</link> is notoriously unreliable, but AG wasted during flaring is estimated to cost Nigeria US $2.5 billion on a yearly basis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> </p>
<p>

The reason for this practice, which is generally agreed world-wide to be wasteful both economically and environmentally, is that in order to maximize production of crude oil, the associated gas accompanying it is often burned off. Even though companies operating in Nigeria also harvest natural gas for commercial purposes, they prefer to extract natural gas from deposits where it is found in isolation, this isolated gas is known as non-associated gas. This occurs because it is costly to separate commercially viable associated gas from the oil. Therefore the AG found with oil is often burned off in order to increase crude production. </p>
<p>

Historically, gas flaring began simultaneously with oil extraction in the 1960s by Shell-BP. Although, the <autocracy wordnetid="108361001" confidence="0.8">

 government subsequently acknowledged that the flaring was unacceptable, it was allowed to continue without any real efforts to change infrastructure and prevent the waste of the gas. This is in contrast to Britain's policies on gas flaring in their own territory, where gas flaring has been reduced to a minimum. </p>
<p>

In fact, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../800/33800.xml">
western Europe</link> 99% of associated gas is used or re-injected into the ground. Gas flaring is generally discouraged and condemned by the international community, as it contributes greatly to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/47512.xml">
climate change</link>. Which ironically can display its most devastating effects in developing countries like Nigeria, and particularly in the semi-arid <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">
<location wordnetid="100027167" confidence="0.8">

</region>
 regions of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../067/27067.xml">
sub-Saharan Africa</link>. The Niger Delta's low-lying plains are also quite vulnerable as they lie only a few meters above <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../529/62529.xml">
sea-level</link>. </p>
<p>

Gas flaring in Nigeria is also highly inefficient and releases large amounts <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/18582230.xml">
methane</link>, which has very high <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/5042951.xml">
global warming</link> potential. The methane is accompanied by the other major <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/37259.xml">
greenhouse gas</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/5906.xml">
carbon dioxide</link>, of which Nigeria was estimated to have emitted more than 34.38million tons in 2002, accounting for about 50% of all industrial emissions in the country and 30% of the total CO2 emissions. As flaring in the west has been minimized, in Nigeria it has grown proportionally with oil production.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> The volume of associated gas produced and therefore burnt off, is directly linked to the amount of oil produced. So even though the percentage of gas flared from 92% in 1981 has fallen to around 70%, the overall amount of flared gas has increased from 2.1 billion&#32;cubic feet (59,000,000&nbsp;m3) to 2.5 billion&#32;cubic feet (71,000,000&nbsp;m3). </p>
<p>

It seems that the international community, the Nigerian government, and the oil corporations are all in agreement that gas flaring has a negative impact and needs to be stopped. However, in reality, efforts at stemming gas flaring have been slow to be implemented. The practice of gas flaring as it has been allowed since oil production began under British, has become set in stone, and would be costly to overhaul to reduce flaring. As a result, little is done by oil companies. This is in spite of the fact that gas flaring in Nigeria has technically been illegal since 1984 under section 3 of the "Associated Gas Reinjection Act". However, none of the regulations stipulated by this document have ever been made public.</p>

, the biggest flarer of natural gas in Nigeria, alike claim that only 50% of all associated gas are burnt off via flaring at present. However, this statistic is accepted by few. The World Bank reported in 2004 that, "Nigeria currently flares 75% of the gas it produces."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> While other sources make similar projections, between 70 and 75% is the generally accepted percentage of gas flared.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> </p>
<p>

Gas flares can have potentially harmful effects on the health and livelihood of the communities in their vicinity, as they release a variety of poisonous chemicals. Just some of combustion by-products include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/238528.xml">
nitrogen dioxide</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/50958.xml">
sulphur dioxide</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/1014518.xml">

benzapyrene</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../142/13932142.xml">
dioxin</link>. Humans exposed to such substances can suffer from a variety of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/3055114.xml">
respiratory problems</link>, which have been reported amongst many children in the Delta but have apparently gone uninvestigated. These chemicals can aggravate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../905/44905.xml">

benzene</link>, which is known to be emitted from gas flares in undocumented quantities, is well researched as being a causative agent for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/18539.xml">

Often gas flares are located close to local communities, and regularly lack adequate fencing or protection for villagers who may risk nearing the tremendous heat of the flare in order to carry out their daily activities. Many of these communities claim that nearby flares cause <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/3263.xml">
acid rain</link> which corrodes their homes and other local structures, many of which have metal roofing. However, whether or not the flares contribute to acid rain is debatable, as some independent studies conducted have found that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/50958.xml">
sulphur dioxide</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/37441.xml">
nitrous oxide</link> content of most flares was insufficient to establish a link between flaring and acid rain. Other studies from <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/1704673.xml">
U.S. Energy Information Administration</link></agency>
 (EIA) report that gas flaring is, "major contributor to air pollution and acid rain".</p>
<p>

Flares which are often older and inefficient are rarely relocated away from villages, and are known to coat the land and communities in the area with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../740/518740.xml">
soot</link> and damage adjacent vegetation. Almost no vegetation can grow in the area directly surrounding the flare due to the tremendous heat it produces.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> </p>
<p>

In November 2005 a judgment by, "the Federal High Court of Nigeria ordered that gas flaring must stop in a Niger Delta community as it violates guaranteed constitutional rights to life and dignity. In a case brought against the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (Shell), Justice C. V. Nwokorie ruled in Benin City that the damaging and wasteful practice of flaring cannot lawfully continue."</p>

One of the greatest threats facing the people of the Niger River Delta has actually been their own government. The Nigerian government has total control over property rights and they have the authority to seize any property for use by the oil companies.  A majority of every dollar that comes out of the ground in the delta goes to the government of Nigeria. As a result of the enormous amounts of sweet light crude that comes out of the delta every day Nigeria has the second largest GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> Despite the wealth flowing into the nation from oil revenues many of Nigeria’s socio-economic factors are worse now than they were 30 years ago <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>
According to the <institute wordnetid="108407330" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/33309.xml">

</institute>
, most of Nigeria’s oil wealth gets siphoned off by 1% of the population <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref>. Corruption in the government is rampant, in fact since 1960 it is estimated that 300 to 400 billion dollars has been stolen by corrupt government officials <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref>. The corruption is found at the highest levels as well. For example a former inspector general of the national police was accused of stealing 52 million dollars. He was sentenced to six years in prison for a lesser charge <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>. </p>
<p>

The situation is very bad and the people have engaged in protests. The problem is many of these protest have been met with unmitigated violence. One example of this occurred in February 2005. There was a protest at Chevrons Escravos oil terminal in which soldiers opened fire on the protestors. One man was killed and 30 others were injured. The soldiers claim that the protestors were armed, a claim the protestors deny <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref>. Another, more extreme example happened in 1994. The Nigerian military moved into a region called Ogoniland in force. They razed 30 villages, arrested hundreds of protestors, and killed an estimated 2,000 people <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref>. </p>

Poverty and chronic underdevelopment</st>
<p>

The people of the delta states live in extreme poverty even in the face of great material wealth found in the waters by their homes. According to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/18947898.xml">
Amnesty International</link> 70% of the six million people in the Niger River Delta live off of less than 1$ US per day <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref>.For many people this means finding work in a labor market, which is in many instances hostile to them. Much of the labor in the past has been imported. To a growing degree the labor force for the oil companies is more and more coming from Nigeria. But discrimination is rampant and for the most part locals are discriminated against <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref>. This leads to a situation where the men in the community have to search for temporary employment. This has two negative effects on the community. First it takes the men out of the community as they go in search of work. The second is the nature of temporary employment sets up unsustainable spending habits <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref>). They earn some money and spend it thinking it will be easy to earn more, when in many cases this does not turn out to be the case. </p>
<p>

As the government officials siphon off all the money generated from oil sales the infrastructure suffers. Most of the villages do not have electricity or even running water <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref>). They do not have good access to schools or medical clinics. For many, even clean drinking water is difficult to come by <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>. The deterioration of the infrastructure in the delta states is so severe it is even a problem in the more urban areas. One example of this is the airport at Port Harcourt. Part of a fence was not properly maintained and an Air France flight hit a herd of cattle on the runway. The airport was closed and is still not open <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref>. </p>
<p>

The leadership of the Niger Delta region are responsible for most of the underdevelopment in the region. There is large scale corruption amongst the elected leaders especially governors <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref> and the leaders have helped sponsor the militants groups kidnapping innocent people and sabotaging efforts by the federal government for any infrastructure development.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> Indicted corrupt leaders are also cheered by the Niger Delta people <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref>.</p>
