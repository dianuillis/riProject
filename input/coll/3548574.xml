An <b>AI Winter</b> is a collapse in the perception of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link> research. The term was coined by analogy with the relentless spiral of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../171/22171.xml">
nuclear winter</link>: a chain reaction of pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><p>

History of machine translation</link></it>
</indent>
During the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/325329.xml">
Cold War</link>, the US government was particularly interested in the automatic, instant translation of <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/25431.xml">

 documents and scientific reports. The government aggressively supported efforts at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../980/19980.xml">
machine translation</link> starting in 1954. At the outset, the researchers were optimistic. <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<philosopher wordnetid="110423589" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/21566.xml">
Noam Chomsky</link></philosopher>
</person>
's new work in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../569/12569.xml">
grammar</link> was streamlining the translation process and there were "many predictions of imminent 'breakthroughs'".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> </p>

<p>

However, researchers had underestimated the profound difficulty of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../065/67065.xml">
disambiguation</link>. In order to translate a sentence, a machine needed to have some idea what the sentence was about, otherwise it made ludicrous mistakes. An anecdotal example was "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak." Translated back and forth with Russian, it became "the vodka is good but the meat is rotten."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> Similarly, "out of sight, out of mind" became "blind idiot." Later researchers would call this the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../339/2239339.xml">
commonsense knowledge</link> problem.</p>
<p>

By 1964, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/37638.xml">
National Research Council</link> had become concerned about the lack progress and formed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/3993712.xml">
Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/3993712.xml">
ALPAC</link>) to look into the problem. They concluded, in a famous 1966 report, that machine translation was more expensive, less accurate and slower than human translation. After spending some 20 million dollars, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/37638.xml">
NRC</link> ended all support. Careers were destroyed and research ended.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

 had been under increasing pressure to fund "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research." Researchers now had to show that their work would soon produce some useful military technology. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/1940377.xml">

's own study (the American Study Group) suggested that most AI research was unlikely to produce anything truly useful in the foreseeable future. As a result, AI research proposals were held to a very high standard. Pure undirected research of the kind that had gone on in the 60s would not be funded by <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

By 1974, funding for AI projects was hard to find. AI researcher <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../556/298556.xml">
Hans Moravec</link> believed that "it was literally phrased at DARPA that 'some of these people were going to be taught a lesson [by] having their two-million-dollar-a-year contracts cut to almost nothing!'"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> and he blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues: "Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration. Their initial promises to <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../957/8957.xml">

 had been much too optimistic. Of course, what they delivered stopped considerably short of that. But they felt they couldn't in their next proposal promise less than in the first one, so they promised more."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>

In the 1980s a form of AI program called an "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/10136.xml">
expert system</link>" was adopted by corporations around the world. The first commercial expert system was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../557/3234557.xml">

, and it was an enormous success: it was estimated to have saved the company 40 million dollars over just six years of operation. Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments. An industry grew up to support them, including software companies like <link>

In some cases, this maintenance involved the assumption of the resulting support work. The maturation of Common Lisp saved many systems such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../989/3070989.xml">

 The fall of expert systems </st>
<p>

Eventually the earliest successful expert systems, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../557/3234557.xml">
XCON</link>, proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, they were "brittle" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs), and they fell prey to problems (such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../287/731287.xml">
qualification problem</link>) that had been identified years earlier in research in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../086/341086.xml">
nonmonotonic logic</link>. Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Another problem dealt with the computational hardness of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/849986.xml">
truth maintenance</link> efforts for general knowledge. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../386/4510386.xml">
KEE</link> used an assumption-based approach (see <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/cognition/papers/roger/chi90.html">

<p>

The few remaining <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/10136.xml">

Fear of another winter</st>
<p>

Concerns are sometimes raised that a new AI winter could be triggered by any overly ambitious or unrealistic promise by prominent AI scientists.  For example, some researchers feared that the widely publicised promises in the early 1990s that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/192733.xml">
Cog</link> would show the intelligence of a human two-year-old might lead to an AI winter.  In fact, the Cog project and the success of <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.8">

Several explanations have been put forth for the cause of AI winters in general. As AI progressed from government funded applications to commercial ones, new dynamics came into play. While <it>hype</it> is the most commonly cited cause, the explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Hype </st>
<p>

<image width="400px" src="Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg" type="thumb">
<caption>

Gartner Inc.'s <link>
Hype Cycle</link> showing the fluctuating support of a new technology
</caption>
</image>

The AI winters can be partly understood as a sequence of over-inflated expectations and subsequent crash seen in stock-markets and examplified by the railway mania and dotcom bubble. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../569/2838569.xml">
hype cycle</link> concept for new technology looks at perception of technology in more detail. It describes a common pattern in development of new technology, where an event, typically a technological breakthrough, creates publicity which feeds on itself to create a "peak of inflated expectations" followed by a "trough of disillusionment" and later recovery and maturation of the technology. The key point is that since scientific and technological progress can't keep pace with the publicity-fueled increase in expectations among investors and other stakeholders, a crash must follow. AI technology seems to be no exception to this rule.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Institutional Factors </st>
<p>

Another factor is AI's place in the organisation of universities. Research on AI often take the form of  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/15201.xml">
interdisciplinary research</link>. One example is the <it>Master of Artificial Intelligence</it> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.mai.kuleuven.ac.be/index.html">
http://www.mai.kuleuven.ac.be/index.html</weblink> program at <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">
<university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.8">
<social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">
<educational_institution wordnetid="108276342" confidence="0.8">
<group wordnetid="100031264" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../193/164193.xml">
K.U. Leuven</link></institution>
</group>
</educational_institution>
</social_group>
</university>
</body>
 which involve lecturers from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/13692155.xml">
Philosophy</link> to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/19528.xml">
Mechanical Engineering</link>. AI is therefore prone to the same problems other types of interdisciplinary research face. Funding is channeled through the established departments and during budget cuts, there will be a tendency to shield the "core contents" of each department, at the expense of interdisciplinary and less traditional research projects. </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Economic Factors </st>
<p>

Downturns in the national economy cause budget cuts in universities. The "core contents" tendency worsen the effect on AI research and investors in the market are likely to put their money into less risky ventures during a crisis. Together this may amplify an economic downturn into an AI winter. It is worth noting that the Lighthill report came at a time of economic crisis in the UK,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2244%22])">44</ref> when universities had to make cuts and the question was only which programs should go.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Empty pipeline </st>
<p>

It is common to see the relationship between basic research and technology as a pipeline. Advances in basic research give birth to advances in applied research, which in turn leads to new commercial applications. From this it is often argued that a lack of basic research will lead to a drop in marketable technology some years down the line. This view was advanced by <computer_scientist wordnetid="109951070" confidence="0.9173553029164789">
<person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/2726304.xml">
James Hendler</link></person>
</computer_scientist>
 in 2008, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref> claiming that the fall of expert systems in the late 80's were not due to and inherent and unavoidable brittleness of expert systems, but to funding cuts in basic research in the 70's. These expert systems advanced in the 80's through applied research and product development, but by the end of the decade, the pipeline had run dry and expert systems were unable to produce improvements that could have overcome the brittleness and secured further funding.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Failure to adapt </st>
<p>

The fall of the Lisp machine market and the failure of the fifth generation computers were cases of expensive advanced products being overtaken by simpler and cheaper alternatives. This fits the definition of a low-end <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/47886.xml">
disruptive technology</link>, with the Lisp machine makers being marginalized. Expert systems were carried over to the new desktop computers by for instance <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/418603.xml">
CLIPS</link>, so the fall of the Lisp machine market and the fall of expert systems are strictly speaking two separate events. Still, the failure to adapt to such a change in the outside computing milieu is cited as one reason for the 80's AI winter.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref></p>
