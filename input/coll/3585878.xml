An <b>SEO contest</b> is an activity awarding prizes that challenges <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../946/187946.xml">
search engine optimization</link> (SEO) practitioners to rank themselves among the major <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/4059023.xml">
search engine</link>s such as <web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/12431.xml">
Google</link></web_site>
, <web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../022/1620022.xml">
Yahoo</link></web_site>
, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/4325491.xml">
MSN</link> using certain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/17138.xml">
keyword</link>(s). This type of contest is controversial because it often leads to massive amounts of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/43651.xml">
link spamming</link> as participants try to boost the rankings of their pages by any means available. </p>
<p>

The organizing body of an SEO competition may hold the activity without promotion of a product or service in mind; or they may organize a contest in order to market something on the Internet.  Participants can showcase their skills and potentially discover and share new techniques for promoting websites.</p>

<st>
History</st>
<p>

The first recorded SEO Contest was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../982/2386982.xml">
Schnitzelmitkartoffelsalat</link> by German webmasters, started on 2002 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../763/21763.xml">
November 15</link> in the German-language <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../994/18588994.xml">
usenet</link> group de.comm.infosystems.www.authoring.misc. In the English-language world, the <it>nigritude ultramarine</it> competition by SearchGuild and DarkBlue (Dark Blue Sea Ltd) is widely acclaimed as the mother of all SEO contests. It was started on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../582/19582.xml">
May 7</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link> and was won two months later by <writer wordnetid="110794014" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/1156262.xml">
Anil Dash</link></writer>
. On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/27530.xml">
September 1</link> of the same year, webmasters were challenged to rank number 1 on <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/1092923.xml">
Google</link></company>
 in three months' time for the search phrase <it>seraphim proudleduck</it>.</p>
<p>

In the first quarter of 2005, people were competing for the term <it>loquine glupe</it>, spawning web sites ranging from shampoo advertising to holiday resorts.</p>
<p>

Internationally, in 2005 two major contests took place in Europe. In Germany the <it>Hommingberger Gepardenforelle</it> (Hommingbergian cheetah trout) by the computer magazine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../462/169462.xml">
c't</link> spawned almost 4 million results. The goal was to find out how search engines rank sites. In Poland almost at same time the Polish SEO community organized the msnbetter thangoogle contest. It topped the 4 million but failed to reach its goal to promote SEO in Poland and to get search engines companies' attention for the Polish market.</p>
<p>

A competition ran from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../787/15787.xml">
January 1</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">
2006</link> to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../346/19346.xml">
March 1</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">
2006</link> and carried the term <it><weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.seologs.com/contest.html">
redscowl bluesingsky</weblink></it>, another set of made-up words. It was sponsored by <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.seologs.com/">
SEOLogs.com</weblink>. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.shoemoney.com">
Shoemoney</weblink> won this contest, and since he contributed the winner's money, he donated it to the number 2 winner.</p>

Tactics</st>

<p>

Some webmasters resort to spam, while others use white-hat optimization techniques, like providing good content covering the competition, or optimizing page titles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Most SEO contests expect people to optimize a single web page for a non-existent phrase of two silly words. The main reason for this is to keep existing web sites from getting a head start. But at the same time it makes sure that regular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
internet</link> searchers won't be bombarded with "spammy" results when searching the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/33139.xml">
web</link> for "regular" information.  </p>
<p>

Rules and limitations can make it harder to benefit from the ranking algorithm, including quirks, of the targeted search engine. For example, the January 2006 Redscowl Bluesingsky contest issued by seologs.com was open for <it>new domains</it> only. That meant that the contestants couldn't benefit from the ranking advantage old web sites are thought to have over new ones. An example of that is the age advantage Anil Dash' blog page had over the well-received but brand new Nigritude Ultramarine FAQ - respectively ended 1st and 6th in the Nigritude Ultramarine challenge. It was expected that the Redscowl Bluesingsky game would be won by a domain of the style "redscowl-bluesingsky.tld" - bound to attract natural links and to benefit from the fact that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../277/32277.xml">
URL</link> is made up entirely of the search words.</p>
<p>

Another special rule that fits well with the 'purpose' of SEO contests today is the obligation to 'link back' to the organizing body, often a search engine optimization site. Since a web document's ranking on major search engines like <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/188213.xml">
Yahoo!</link></company>
, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/1092923.xml">
Google</link></company>
 or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/4325491.xml">
MSN Search</link> is mainly determined by internet <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/49547.xml">
hyperlinks</link> pointing to that document, forcing webmasters to link to a web site is quite a powerful way to increase its web presence.  Good example are the contest announced by V7N (using the phrase v7ndotcom elursrebmem) and its counterpart by WebGuerrilla. While the first of these originally required the contestants to link to V7N forums, the second forbids its players to do just that. Instead a special link to Google engineer <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">
<person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.8">

' blog is imperative. Because of this rivalry, both the rules and prize money on both these www.SEO-sk.com contests were updated regularly up until the official start date of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/15790.xml">
January 15</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">

There were about two hundred competitors, who deployed a variety of methods, from <technique wordnetid="105665146" confidence="0.8">

ing upwards.  The competitive conditions encouraged intensive, free use of techniques that would have otherwise been used in a more conservative manner, and it is entirely possible that some normally-legitimate SEOs took a more aggressive approach for the occasion.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/33645.xml">
Weblog</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/32851.xml">
wiki</link>s were hit by the contest, and needed to be constantly policed to prevent "nigritude ultramarine" <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../368/28368.xml">
spam</link> from lowering their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../706/41706.xml">
signal-to-noise ratio</link> below acceptable limits.  Public wiki sandboxes were especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../863/15863.xml">

 was announced as the contest winner. Dash stated that his goal in entering the contest was to "prove that real content trumps all the shady optimization tricks that someone can figure out". Instead of resorting to such tactics, he simply wrote a weblog entry and asked his readers to link to it.  Another competitor took this idea further and wrote the <it>Nigritude Ultramarine FAQ</it>, which placed sixth overall, won the "Judge's Choice" award, and remains a valuable source of information about the competition.</p>

Afterlife</st>
<p>

As of August 2008, the top two Google results are the blog entry that won the competition and the <it>Nigritude Ultramarine FAQ</it>. The fourth is the <web_site wordnetid="106359193" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../734/5043734.xml">

 article on SEO contests (this page).</p>
<p>

It is known that Google generally tries to detect and penalise dirty tricks, and <it>nigritude ultramarine</it> makes an obvious test case.  An important open question remains whether Google has treated <it>nigritude ultramarine</it> specially in any way; the company has refused to comment. As of September 2004, the Google results do not appear hand-crafted, and several insipid pages appear high&mdash;although lower than they did during the competition&mdash;on the search page. </p>
<p>

Comparison of search results for <it>nigritude ultramarine</it> during and after the competition is complicated by the change the competition has caused to the meaning of the phrase.  Before, it was purely a nonsense phrase that could not possibly be searched for by anyone looking for any real resource.  Now it refers primarily to the competition itself, and is a natural phrase to use to find information about the competition.  (As of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/27990.xml">
September 5</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/35524.xml">
2004</link>, the highest Google result that is an official competition page is SearchGuild's, which is ranked 18th.)  It is also natural for someone to search for the phrase to find out why it appears on so many webpages.  (The Nigritude Ultramarine FAQ, ranked second as of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../815/15815.xml">
June 18</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">
2006</link>, is an excellent resource for this.)</p>
<p>

Furthermore, due to the nature of web searching, any web-based reporting about the <it>nigritude ultramarine</it> competition, feeds back and affects the search results in question. This effect was previously noticed in the reporting of <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

s, and takes a more complex form in this case.</p>

Over 1,000,000 web pages linked to precharge.net in order to promote the precharge projectnet seo contest and less than a week before the contest ended, the United States Congress announced that the 109th congress had tabled the bill until the following term only, having helped to defeat the bill that may have changed the internet. This was the first seo contest to assist in driving public policy and affect the internet as a whole as well as one of the most successful contests to date with over 7,000 participants worldwide.</p>
