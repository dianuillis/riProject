<b>Chinese immigration to the United States</b> consists of three major waves with the first beginning in the early 19th century. For nearly two centuries, the history of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../977/5878977.xml">

) and the mining industry, and suffered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/25613.xml">
racial discrimination</link> for a long time. While industrial employers were eager to get this new and cheap labor, the ordinary white public was stirred to anger by the presence of this "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../452/331452.xml">
yellow peril</link>." Political party caucuses, labor unions, and other organizations railed against the immigration of yet another "inferior race." Newspapers condemned the policies of employers, and even church leaders denounced the entrance of these <class wordnetid="107997703" confidence="0.8">

 into what was regarded as a land for whites only. So hostile did the opposition last that in 1882 the <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">

 eventually passed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/55668.xml">
Chinese Exclusion Act</link> which prohibited immigration from China for the next ten years. This law was extended by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/1134285.xml">
Geary Act</link> in 1892. The Chinese Exclusion Act, passed by Congress in 1882, was the only <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../413/14762413.xml">

These laws not only prevented new immigration but also brought additional suffering as they prevented the reunion of the families of thousands of Chinese men already living in America that had left China without their wives and children; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../048/2396048.xml">
anti-miscegenation laws</link> in many states prohibited Chinese men from marrying white women.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

In 1924 the law barred further entries of Chinese; those already in the United States had been ineligible for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/6784.xml">
citizenship</link> since the previous year. Also by 1924, all Asian immigrants (except people from the Philippines, which had been annexed by the United States in 1898) were utterly excluded by law, denied citizenship and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../314/42314.xml">

, did the situation for Chinese Americans begin to improve, as restrictions on entry into the country, naturalization and  mixed marriage were being lessened. In 1943, Chinese immigration to the U.S. was once again permitted — by way of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/1134299.xml">

Decrees by the Qing dynasty issued in 1712 and 1724, forbade emigration and overseas trade and were primarily intended to prevent remnant supporters of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/43449.xml">
Ming dynasty</link> from establishing bases overseas.  However these decrees were widely ignored.  Large scale immigration of Chinese laborers began after the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../962/169962.xml">

Burlinghame Treaty</link> with the United States in 1868 effectively lifted any restrictions on emigration and began large-scale immigration to the United States.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> In order to avoid as much as possible the troubles of leaving, most of the Chinese gold-seekers embarked on their transpacific voyage from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../721/4721.xml">

peonage</link>). Only merchants were able to take their wives and children overseas. The vast majority of Chinese migrants were peasants, farmers and craftsmen. Young men, who were usually married, left their wives and children behind since they at first had the intention of only staying in America temporarily. Wives also had another major reason for staying behind as they had a traditional role in looking after her parents-in-law. From the money which the men earned in America they sent a large part back to China. Because it was usual in China at the time to live in very socially confined social nets of families, unions and guilds, sometimes whole village communities and even regions (for instance, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../156/294156.xml">

California gold rush</link> to 1882 – when an American federal law ended the Chinese influx – approximately 300,000 Chinese had arrived in the United States. Because the chances to earn more money were by far better in America than in China, these migrants often remained considerably longer than they had at first planned, despite of the increased <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../141/34141.xml">

 between the United States and China. But there were differences compared with the policy for European immigrants, in that if the Chinese migrants had children that were born in the USA, those children would automatically acquire <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/993845.xml">
American citizenship</link>, but the immigrants themselves would remain as foreigners indefinitely. Unlike that with European immigrants the possibility of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../314/42314.xml">
naturalization</link> was withheld from them.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref></p>
<p>

Although the newcomers arrived in America after an already established small community of their fellow compatriots, they experienced many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/394976.xml">
culture shocks</link> in what to them was a strange country. The Chinese immigrants neither spoke and understood <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/8569916.xml">
English</link></language>
 nor were familiar with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/18973910.xml">
western culture</link> and life; they often came from the rural lands in China and therefore had difficulty in adjusting to and finding their way around big towns like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../728/49728.xml">
San Francisco</link>. The racism which they had met from the European Americans from the outset of their arrival increased continuously to the turn of the century and prevented with lasting effect their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/505730.xml">
assimilation</link> into mainstream American society; this in turn led to the creation, cohesion and cooperation of many Chinese benevolent associations and societies whose existence in the U.S. remained far into the 20th century as a necessity both for support and survival for the Chinese in America. There were also many other reasons that laid within the Chinese themselves that had obstructed and hindered their assimilation, notably their appearance.

 custom of dressing including shaving the front of their heads and combing the remaining hair into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/5731574.xml">
queue</link>. Historically, to the Manchus, the policy was both an act of submission and, in practical terms, an identification aid of friend from foe. Because Chinese immigrants returned as often as they could to China to see their family, they could not when in America cut off their often hated braids and then legally enter China again.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>

 remained at first low. They were mainly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/23249.xml">
Protestants</link> who had already been converted in China where foreign Christian missionaries (who had first come en mass in the 19th century) had strived for centuries to wholly Christianize the nation with relatively minor success. Christian missionaries had also worked in the Chinese communities and settlements in America, but nevertheless their religious message found few who were receptive. It was estimated that during the first wave until the 1882 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/55668.xml">
Chinese Exclusion Act</link>, less than 20 percent of Chinese immigrants had accepted Christian teachings. Their difficulty in being integrated was also exemplified by the end of the first wave in the mid-20th century when only a minority of Chinese living in the U.S. could speak <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/8569916.xml">

Of the first wave of Chinese who came to America, few were women. In 1850, the Chinese community of San Francisco consisted of 4018 men and only 7 women. In 1855, women made up only two percent of the Chinese population in the U.S., and even in 1890 it had increased to only 4.8 percent. The lack of visibility of Chinese women in the general public was due partially to factors such as the cost of making the voyage when there was a lack of work opportunities for Chinese women in America, harsh working conditions and having the traditional female responsibility of looking after the children and extended family back in China. The only women who did go to America were usually the wives of merchants. Other factors were cultural in nature, such as having <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../760/176760.xml">
bound feet</link> and not leaving the home. Another important consideration was that most Chinese men were worried that by bringing their wives and raising families in America they too would have been subjected to the same racial violence and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/8900.xml">
discrimination</link> which they themselves had faced. With the heavily uneven gender ratio, prostitution grew rapidly and the Chinese <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/15157915.xml">

prostitutes</link> as an occupation. The existence of Chinese prostitution was detected early, after which the police, legislature and popular press singled out Chinese prostitutes for criticism and were seen as further evidence of the depravity of the Chinese and the repression of their women by their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../939/24939.xml">
patriarchal</link> cultural values.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>

Laws passed by the California state legislature in 1866 that sought to curb the brothels and missionary activity by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../119/20119.xml">
Methodist</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/24403.xml">

1880 U.S. Census</link> documents only 24 percent of 3171 Chinese women in California were classified as prostitutes. Many of these women married Chinese Christians and formed some of the earliest Chinese-American families in mainland America. Nevertheless, American legislation used the prostitution issue to make the immigration of Chinese women far more difficult.

In effect, this lead to American officials to class many women as prostitutes, who actually were not, which greatly reduced the opportunities for all Oriental women to enter the United States.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>

San Francisco</link> respectable Chinese merchants – the most prominent members of the Chinese community of the time – made the first assiduous effort to form social and welfare organizations (Chinese: "<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../507/1553507.xml">

A minority of the Chinese immigrants did not join the CCBA as they were outcasts or lacked the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/682573.xml">
clan or family ties</link> to join more prestigious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/54761.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../151/164151.xml">

 - for mutual support and protection of their members. These first tongs modeled themselves upon the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../296/627296.xml">
triads</link>, underground organizations dedicated to the overthrow of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../310/25310.xml">

<p>

Marginalized, poor, low educational levels and lacking opportunities than the wealthier Chinese, the tongs (unlike the triads) had formed without any clear political motives and soon found themselves involved in lucrative <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/5785.xml">

. This immigration may have been as high as 90% male as most immigrated with the thought of returning home to start a new life. Those that stayed in America faced the lack of suitable Chinese brides as Chinese women were not allowed to emigrate in significant numbers after 1872.  As a result, the mostly bachelor communities slowly aged in place with very low Chinese birth rates.</p>

: <it>Gam Saan</it>, 金山). Because anarchic conditions prevailed in the gold fields, the robbery by European miners of Chinese mining area permits were barely pursued or prosecuted and the Chinese gold seekers themselves were often victim to violent assaults. In response to this hostile situation these Chinese miners developed a basic approach which differed from the white European gold miners; while the Europeans mostly worked as individuals or in small groups, the Chinese formed large teams, in which not only were they protected against attacks, but on account of their good organization they also often achieved a considerably higher yield. To protect themselves even further against attacks, they preferred to mainly turn to such areas which had been previously judged by other gold seekers as unproductive and had been given up. Because much of the gold fields were exhaustingly gone over up until the beginning of the 20th century, many of the Chinese remained far longer there than the European gold seekers; in 1870, a third of the men in the Californian golden fields were Chinese.</p>
<p>

However, their displacement had begun already in 1850 when  the white gold miners began to resent the Chinese miners, feeling that they were discovering gold that the white miners deserved. And eventually, protest rose from white miners to eliminate the growing competition. From 1852 to 1870 (ironically when the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../091/632091.xml">
Civil Rights Act of 1866</link> was passed), the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/425922.xml">
California legislature</link> enforced a series of taxes.</p>
<p>

In 1852, a special foreign miner's tax aimed at the Chinese was passed by the California legislature that was aimed at foreign miners who were not U.S. citizens. Given that the Chinese were ineligible for citizenship at that time and constituted the largest percentage of the non-white population, the taxes were primarily aimed at them and tax revenue was therefore generated almost exclusively by the Chinese.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> This tax required a payment of three dollars each month at a time when Chinese miners were making approximately six dollars a month. Tax collectors could legally take and sell the property of those miners who refused or could not pay the tax. Fake tax collectors made money by taking advantage of people who could not speak English well, and some tax collectors, both false and real, stabbed or shot miners who could not or would not pay the tax. During the 1860s, many Chinese were expelled from the mine fields and were forced to find other types of jobs. This Foreign Miner's Tax existed till 1870.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref></p>
<p>

The position of the Chinese gold seekers also was complicated by a decision of the <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

The ruling effectively made white violence against Chinese Americans unprosecutable, arguably leading to more intense white-on-Chinese race riots, such as the <link>
1877 San Francisco Riot</link>. The Chinese living in California were with this decision left practically in a legal vacuum, because they had now no possibility to assert their rightful legal entitlements or claims – possibly in cases of theft or breaches of agreement – in court. The ruling remained in force until 1873.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref></p>

Since there was a lack of white European construction workers, in 1865 a large number of Chinese workers were recruited from the silver mines, as well as later contract workers from China. The idea for the use of Chinese labor came from the manager of the Central Pacific Railroad, <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/396892.xml">

, hiring Chinese as opposed to whites kept labor costs down by a third, since the company would not pay their board or lodging.  This type of steep wage inequality was commonplace at the time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> Eventually Crocker overcame shortages of manpower and money by hiring Chinese immigrants to do much of the back-breaking and dangerous labor. He drove the workers to the point of exhaustion, in the process setting records for laying track and finishing the project seven years ahead of the government's deadline.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref> </p>
<p>

The Central Pacific track was constructed primarily by Chinese immigrants. Even though at first they were thought to be too weak or fragile to do this type of work, after the first day in which Chinese were on the line, the decision was made to hire as many as could be found in California (where most were gold miners or in service industries such as laundries and kitchens). Many more were imported from China. Most of the men received between one and three dollars per day, but the workers from China received much less. Eventually, they went on strike and gained small increases in salary.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref></p>

 - where tunnels had to be created. The explosions had caused many of the Chinese laborers to lose their lives. Due to the wide expanse of the work, the construction had to be carried out at times in the extreme heat and also in other times in the bitter winter cold. So harsh were the conditions that sometimes even entire camps were buried under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../321/73321.xml">

. However construction was slowed, first by the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, then by the mountains themselves and most importantly by winter snowstorms. Consequently, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire immigrant laborers (many of whom were Chinese). The immigrants seemed to be more willing to tolerate the horrible conditions, and progress continued. The increasing necessity for tunnelling then began to slow progress of the line yet again. To combat this, Central Pacific began to use the newly invented and very unstable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/21530.xml">
nitro-glycerine</link> explosives—which accelerated both the rate of construction and the mortality of the Chinese laborers. Appalled by the losses, the Central Pacific began to use less volatile explosives and developed a method of placing the explosives in which the Chinese blasters worked from large suspended baskets which were then rapidly pulled to safety after the fuses were lit.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref></p>
<p>

The well organized Chinese teams still turned out to be highly industrious and exceedingly efficient; at the peak of the construction work, shortly before completion of the railroad, more than 11,000 Chinese were involved with the project. Although the white European workers had higher wages and better working conditions, their share of the workforce was never more than 10 percent. As the Chinese railroad workers lived and worked tirelessly, they also managed the finances associated with their employment, and Central Pacific officials responsible for employing the Chinese, even those at first opposed to the hiring policy, came to appreciate the cleanliness and reliability of this group of laborers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref></p>

Up until the middle of the 19th century, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../858/36858.xml">
wheat</link> was primarily grown in California. The favorable climate allowed the beginning of the intensive cultivation of certain fruit, vegetables and flowers. In the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../126/89126.xml">
East Coast of the United States</link> a strong demand for these products existed. However, the supply of these markets became possible only with the completion of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/51916.xml">
transcontinental railroad</link>. Just as with the railway construction, there was a dire manpower shortage in the expanding Californian agriculture sector, so the white landowners began in the 1860s to put thousands of Chinese migrants to work in their large-scale farms and other agricultural enterprises. Many of these Chinese laborers were not unskilled seasonal workers, but were in fact experienced farmers, whose vital expertise the Californian fruit, vegetables and wine industries owe much to this very day. Despite this, the Chinese immigrants could not own any land on account of the laws in California at the time. Nevertheless they frequently pursued agricultural work under leases or profit-sharing contracts which they signed with their employers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref></p>

This know-how was used for the reclamation of the extensive valleys of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

 in California. These levees opened up thousands of acres of highly fertile <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/169208.xml">
marsh</link>lands for agricultural production. Chinese workers were used to construct hundreds of miles of levees throughout the delta's waterways in an effort to reclaim and preserve farmland and control flooding. These levees therefore confined waterflow to the riverbeds. Many of the workers stayed in the area and made a living as farm workers or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../914/445914.xml">

. The party took particular aim against Chinese immigrant labor and the Central Pacific Railroad which employed them. Its famous slogan was <it>"The Chinese must go!"</it>. Kearney's attacks against the Chinese were particularly virulent and openly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/25613.xml">
racist</link>, and found considerable support among white people in the American West. This sentiment led eventually to the Chinese Exclusion Act. Their propaganda branded the Chinese migrants as "perpetual foreigners" whose work caused wage dumping and thereby prevented American men from "gaining work". After the 1893 economic downturn, measures adopted in the severe depression included anti-Chinese riots that eventually spread throughout the West from which came racist violence and massacres. Most of the Chinese farm workers, which in 1890 made up a 75 percent share of all Californian agricultural workers, were expelled.

The vacant agricultural jobs subsequently proved to be so unattractive to the unemployed white Europeans that they avoided to sign up; most of the vacancies were then filled by Japanese workers, after whom in the decades later came the Filippinos, and finally the Mexicans.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref></p>

ns – moved into fishing off the American west coast too, and they exerted pressure on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/425922.xml">
California legislature</link>, which, finally, expelled the Chinese fishermen with a whole array of taxes, laws and regulations. They had to pay special taxes (Chinese Fisherman's Tax), and they were not allowed to fish with traditional Chinese nets nor with junks. The most disastrous effect occurred when the <link>
Scott Act</link>, a federal US law adopted in 1888, established that the Chinese migrants, even when they had entered and were living the US legally, could not re-enter after having temporarily left US territory. The Chinese fishermen, in effect, could therefore not leave with their boats the 3-mile (4.8&nbsp;km) zone of the west coast.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref> Their work became unprofitable, and gradually they gave up fishing.

Many former fishermen found work in the salmon <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/198153.xml">

Since the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../296/58296.xml">
California gold rush</link>, many Chinese migrants made their living as domestic servants, housekeepers, running restaurants, laundries (leading to the 1886 Supreme Court decision <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/1346366.xml">
Yick Wo v. Hopkins</link> and then to the 1933 creation of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../888/19036888.xml">
Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance</link>) and a wide spectrum of shops, such as food stores, antique shops, jewelers, and imported goods stores. In addition, the Chinese often worked in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../560/65560.xml">
borax</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../142/18617142.xml">
mercury</link> mines, as seamen on board the ships of American shipping companies or in the consumer goods industry, especially in the cigar, boots, footwear and textile manufacturing. During the economic crises of the 1870s, factory owners were often glad that the migrants were content with the low wages given. The Chinese took the bad wages, because their wives and children lived in China where the cost of living was low. As they were classified as foreigners they were excluded from joining American <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/17626.xml">
trade union</link>s, and so they formed their own Chinese organizations (called "guilds") which represented their interests with the employers. The American trade unionists were nevertheless still wary as the Chinese workers were willing to work for their employers for relatively low wages and incidentally acted as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../941/1857941.xml">
strikebreaker</link>s thereby running counter to the interests of the trade unions. In fact, many employers used the threat of importing Chinese strikebreakers as a means to prevent or break up strikes which caused further resentment against the Chinese. A notable incident occurred in 1870, when 75 young men from China were hired to replace striking shoe workers in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../691/116691.xml">
North Adams, Massachusetts</link></village>
.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2250%22])">50</ref> Nevertheless, these young men had no idea that they had been brought from San Francisco by the superintendent of the shoe factory to act as strikebreakers at their destination. This incident provided the trade unions with their propaganda which was later repeatedly cited calling for the immediate and total exclusion of the Chinese. This particular controversy slackened somewhat as attention focused on the economic crises in 1875 when the majority of cigar and boots manufacturing companies went under. Mainly it was the textile industry that survived which still employed Chinese workers in large numbers. In 1876, in response to the rising anti-Chinese hysteria, both major political parties included Chinese exclusion in their campaign platforms as a way to win votes taking advantage of the nation's industrial crisis. Rather than directly confronting the divisive problems such as class conflict, economic depression, and rising unemployment, this helped put the question of Chinese immigration and contracted Chinese workers on the national agenda and eventually paved way for the era's most racist legislation, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../668/55668.xml">
Chinese Exclusion Act</link> in 1882.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2251%22])">51</ref></p>

As the easy gold dwindled and competition for it intensified, animosity to the Chinese and other foreigners increased. Organized labor groups demanded that California's gold was only for Americans, and began to physically threaten foreigners' mines or gold diggings. Most, after being forcibly driven from the mines, settled in Chinese enclaves in cities, mainly San Francisco, and took up low end wage labor such as restaurant work and laundry. A few settled in towns throughout the west.

 on Taiwan as the sole legitimate government of all of China, and the immigration from Taiwan was counted under the same quota as that for mainland China, which had no immigration to the United States from 1949 to 1977.  During the late 1970s, the opening up of the People's Republic of China and the breaking of diplomatic relations with the Republic of China led to the passage, in 1979, of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../366/66366.xml">

These two groups of Chinese tended to cluster in suburban areas and to avoid urban Chinatowns and speak fluent Mandarin in addition to their native dialects.</p>

In the 1980s, there was widespread concern by the <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

Many immigrants from the PRC benefited from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../615/265615.xml">
Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992</link> which granted permanent residency status to immigrants from the PRC. One unintended side effect of the law was that the primary beneficiaries of the law were undocumented Fujianese immigrants, who unlike the Chinese graduate students would have had no chance to gain permanent residency through normal means.</p>

Ong, Paul M. "The Central Pacific Railroad and Exploitation of Chinese Labor." Journal of Ethnic Studies 1985 13(2): 119-124. ISSN 0091-3219. -- Ong tries to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature on Asians in early California, with contradictory studies showing evidence both for and against the exploitation of Chinese labor by the Central Pacific Railroad, using monopsony theory as developed by Joan Robinson. Monopsonists are buyers whose share of the market is large enough to affect prices, or whose supply curves are not completely elastic. By setting different wages for whites and Chinese - each having different elasticities of supply - and using Chinese in the menial and dangerous jobs, with whites in the better positions, the two groups were complementary rather than interchangeable. Calculations thus prove higher levels of exploitation of the Chinese than in previous studies.</entry>
