<b>Transportation Demand Management</b> or <b>Travel Demand Management</b> (both TDM) is the application of strategies and policies to reduce automobile travel demand, or to redistribute this demand in space or in time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> <p>

In transport as in any network, managing demand can be a cost-effective alternative to increasing capacity.  A demand management approach to transport also has the potential to deliver better environmental outcomes, improved public health and stronger communities, and more prosperous and livable cities.  The techniques of TDM, applied by government transport agencies, link with and supports community movements for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/1002744.xml">
sustainable transport</link>.</p>

. As long lines appeared at gas stations, it became self-evident that alternatives to single occupancy commuter travel needed to be provided in order to save energy, improve air quality, and reduce peak period <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/234226.xml">
congestion</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The concepts of TDM borrowed from mainstream transport planning in Europe, which had never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility.  For example the <link>
 Dutch</link> Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met "if the contribution to societal welfare is positive", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> </p>
<p>

Some cities outside Europe have also consistently taken a demand management approach to transport and land use planning, notably <city wordnetid="108524735" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980's and 1990's led to significant increases in vehicle travel, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/655311.xml">
urban sprawl</link>.  Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for <link>
 just in time</link> deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.</p>
<p>

Because vehicle travel was increasing rapidly from 1980-2000, it follows that (with a few exceptions) the techniques of demand management were not widely or successfully applied during this period.  Small-scale projects to provide alternatives to single occupant commuter travel were common, but generally were led from outside the mainstream of transport planning.  However many of the techniques in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Demand_Management_Toolbox+%22])">
 demand management toolbox</link> were developed during this period.</p>
<p>

The British Government's <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/fot/">
White Paper on Transport</weblink> marked a change in direction.  In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that 
We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible - and would not work. </p>
<p>

A companion document to the White Paper called <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/smarterchoices/">
Smarter Choices</weblink> researched the potential to "scale up" the small and scattered demand management initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

A <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/mitig_traf_cong/index.htm">
similar study</weblink> by the United States Federal Highway Administration,  was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy.</p>

Why manage travel demand?</st>

<p>

The need to manage travel demand has now become urgent for a number of converging reasons.  </p>
<p>

<link>
 Oil prices</link> have now passed the previous peak in 1980, and 95% of all energy used in transport is oil.  Vehicle travel in the United States, which has been rising steadily since records began, began to level out before the fuel price increases and is now in decline.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>.  Part of this decline is likely to be people making fewer trips, with potentially far-reaching economic and social consequences.  Countries and cities where the car is one of many travel choices are more likely to prosper, as people can choose to drive less but are still able to travel by transit, cycle safely, walk to local shops and facilities, or choose to work or study from home.  </p>
<p>

Transport systems are responsible for 23% of energy-related <link>
greehouse gas</link> emissions, and are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> 
Demand management is central to the effort to reduce <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/37259.xml">
greenhouse gas</link> emissions from urban transportation,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> </p>
<p>

Increases in vehicle travel are linked to a range of health problems including poor urban air quality, road injuries and fatalities, and reduced physical activity.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/33583.xml">
World Health Organisation</link> released a <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/charter_transporte.pdf">
Charter on Transport, Environment and Health</weblink> in 2003, and stated that:</p>
<p>

We are concerned that current patterns of transport, which are dominated by motorised road transport, have substantial adverse impacts on health.</p>

<p>

The efficacy of expanded roadways in managing traffic congestion is increasingly under challenge.  Much of the traffic on new or expanded roads has been shown to be <link>
 induced</link>.</p>
<p>

A growing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/1002744.xml">
sustainable transport</link> movement is mobilising public demand for investment in safer, more livable cities with a greater range of travel choices.</p>
