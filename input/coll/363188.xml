NetWare has been superseded by <link>
Open Enterprise Server</link> (OES). The latest version of NetWare is v6.5 Support Pack 7, which is identical to OES 2, NetWare Kernel.</p>

<sec>
<st>
 History </st>
<p>

NetWare evolved from a very simple concept: file sharing instead of disk sharing. In 1983 when the first versions of NetWare were designed, all other competing products were based on the concept of providing shared direct disk access. Novell's alternative approach was validated by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/18622259.xml">
IBM</link></company>
 in 1984 and helped promote their product.</p>
<p>

With Novell NetWare, disk space was shared in the form of NetWare <it>volumes</it>, comparable to DOS volumes. Clients running <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../027/20027.xml">
MS-DOS</link></O>
 would run a special <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../741/69741.xml">
Terminate and Stay Resident</link> (TSR) program that allowed them to <it>map</it> a local drive letter to a NetWare volume. Clients had to log in to a server in order to be allowed to map volumes, and access could be restricted according to the login name. Similarly, they could connect to shared printers on the dedicated server, and print as if the printer was connected locally. NetWare established the dominant position in the market in the early and middle 1990s by developing its XNS-derived <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/421044.xml">
IPX/SPX</link> protocol as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/17739.xml">
local area network</link> (LAN) standard.</p>
<p>

At the end of the 1990s, with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> connectivity booming, the Internet's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../476/15476.xml">
TCP/IP</link> protocol became dominant on LANs. Novell had introduced limited TCP/IP support in NetWare v3.x (circa 1992) and v4.x (circa 1995), consisting mainly of FTP services and UNIX-style LPR/LPD printing (available in NetWare v3.x), and a Novell-developed webserver (in NetWare v4.x). Native TCP/IP support for the client file and print services normally associated with NetWare was introduced in NetWare v5.0 (released in 1998).</p>
<p>

While some attribute Novell's delay in adopting TCP/IP as its native protocol to the loss of NetWare's dominance, it's more accurate to say that Novell allowed itself to be outmarketed. During the early-to-mid 1980s <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 The rise of NetWare </st>
<p>

The popular use and growth of Novell NetWare began in 1985 with the simultaneous release of NetWare 286 2.0a and the <chip wordnetid="103020034" confidence="0.8">

 16-bit processor.  The 80286 CPU featured a new 16-bit protected mode that provided access to up to 16 MB RAM as well as mechanisms to support multi-tasking.  Prior to the 80286 CPU, servers were based on the Intel 8086/8088 8/16-bit processors limited to an address space of 1MB with not more than 640 KB usable RAM which did not support multi-tasking.</p>
<p>

The combination of a higher 16 MB RAM limit, 80286 processor feature utilization, and 256 MB NetWare volume size limit allowed reliable, cost-effective server-based local area networks to be built for the first time. The 16 MB RAM limit was especially important, since it made enough RAM available for disk caching to significantly improve performance. This became the key to Novell's performance while also allowing larger networks to be built.</p>
<p>

Another significant difference of NetWare 286 was that it was hardware-independent, unlike competing server systems from 3Com. Novell servers could be assembled using any brand system with an Intel 80286 or higher CPU, any <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Novell also designed a compact and simple DOS client software program that allowed DOS stations to connect to a server and access the shared server hard drive. While the NetWare server file system introduced a new, proprietary file system design, it looked like a standard DOS volume to the workstation, ensuring compatibility with all existing DOS programs.</p>

protected mode</link>, extending NetWare's support of RAM from 1 MB to the full 16 MB addressable by the 80286. A minimum of 2 MB was required to start up the operating system; any additional RAM was used for FAT, DET and file caching. Since 16-bit protected mode was implemented the i80286 and every subsequent Intel x86 processor, NetWare 286 version 2.x would run on any 80286 or later compatible processor.</p>

NetWare 286 2.x supported two modes of operation: dedicated and non-dedicated. In dedicated mode, the server used DOS only as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../909/40909.xml">
boot loader</link> to execute the operating system file net$os.exe. All memory was allocated to NetWare; no DOS ran on the server. For non-dedicated operation, DOS 3.3 or higher would remain in memory, and the processor would time-slice between the DOS and NetWare programs, allowing the server computer to be used simultaneously as network file server and as a user workstation. All <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/420201.xml">
extended memory</link> (RAM above 1 MB) was allocated to NetWare, so DOS was limited to only 640kB; an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/420214.xml">
expanded memory</link> manager would not work because NetWare 286 had control of 80286 protected mode and the upper RAM, both of which were required for DOS to use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/420214.xml">
expanded memory</link>. Time slicing was accomplished using the keyboard <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/15289.xml">
interrupt</link>. This feature required strict compliance with the IBM PC design model, otherwise performance was affected. Non-dedicated NetWare was popular on small networks, although it was more susceptible to lockups due to DOS program problems. In some implementations, users would experience significant network slowdown when someone was using the console as a workstation.  NetWare 386 3.x and later supported only dedicated operation.</p>
<p>

Server licensing on early versions of NetWare 286 was accomplished by using a key card.  The key card was designed for an 8-bit ISA bus, and had a serial number encoded on a ROM chip.  The serial number had to match the serial number of the NetWare software running on the server.  To broaden the hardware base, particularly to machines using the IBM MCA bus, later versions of NetWare 2.x did not require the key card; serialised license floppy disks were used in place of the key cards.</p>

 NetWare 3.x </st>
<p>

Starting with NetWare 3.x, support for 32-bit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/167596.xml">
protected mode</link> was added, eliminating the 16 mb memory limit of NetWare 286. This allowed larger hard drives to be supported, since NetWare 3.x cached (copied) the entire <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../045/53045.xml">
file allocation table</link> (FAT) and <link>
directory entry table</link> (DET) into memory for improved performance.</p>
<p>

By accident or design, the initial releases of the client TSR programs modified the high 16 bits of the 32-bit 80386 registers, making them unusable by any other program until this was fixed. The problem was noticed by <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9638700866880419">

 suite of programs to enable 32-bit register use only when the Netware TSRs were not present.</p>
<p>

NetWare version 3 eased development and administration by modularization. Each functionality was controlled by a software module called a <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/3258313.xml">
NetWare Loadable Module</link></format>
 (NLM) loaded either at startup or when it was needed. It was then possible to add functionality such as anti-virus software, backup software, database and web servers, long name support (standard filenames were limited to 8 characters plus a three letter extension, matching <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

) or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/19006979.xml">
Macintosh</link> style files.</p>
<p>

NetWare continued to be administered using console-based utilities. The file system introduced by NetWare 3.x and used by default until NetWare 5.x was <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

 386, or NWFS 386, which significantly extended volume capacity (1 TB, 4 GB files) and could handle up to 16 volume segments spanning multiple physical disk drives. Volume segments could be added while the server was in use and the volume was mounted, allowing a server to be expanded without interruption.</p>
<p>

Initially, NetWare used <it>Bindery services</it> for authentication. This was a stand-alone database system where all user access and security data resided individually on each server. When an infrastructure contained more than one server, users had to log-in to each of them individually, and each server had to be configured with the list of all allowed users.</p>
<p>

"NetWare Name Services" was a product that allowed user data to be extended across multiple servers, and the Windows "Domain" concept is functionally equivalent to NetWare v3.x Bindery services with NetWare Name Services added on (e.g. a 2-dimensional database, with a flat namespace and a static schema).</p>
<p>

For a while, Novell also marketed an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/69922.xml">
OEM</link> version of NetWare 3, called <b>Portable NetWare</b>, together with OEMs such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/13973.xml">
Hewlett-Packard</link>, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/157959.xml">
Data General</link></institution>
</company>
, who ported Novell source code to run on top of their Unix operating systems. Portable NetWare did not sell well.</p>
<p>

While Netware 3.x was current, Novell introduced its first high-availability clustering system, named <b>NetWare SFT-III</b>, which allowed a logical server to be completely mirrored to a separate physical machine. Implemented as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/275651.xml">
shared-nothing</link> cluster, under SFT-III the OS was logically split into an interrupt-driven <it>I/O engine</it> and the event-driven OS core. The I/O engines serialized their interrupts (disk, network etc.) into a combined event stream that was fed to two identical copies of the system engine through a fast (typically 100 Mbit/s) inter-server link. Because of its non-preemptive nature, the OS core, stripped of non-deterministic I/O, behaves deterministically, like a large <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/10931.xml">
finite state machine</link>.</p>
<p>

The outputs of the two system engines were compared to ensure proper operation, and two copies fed back to the I/O engines. Using the existing SFT-II software RAID functionality present in the core, disks could be mirrored between the two machines without special hardware. The two machines could be separated as far as the server-to-server link would permit. In case of a server or disk failure, the surviving server could take over client sessions transparently after a short pause since it had full state information and did not, for example, have to re-mount the volumes - a process at which NetWare was notoriously slow. SFT-III was the first NetWare version able to make use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/50318.xml">
SMP</link> hardware - the I/O engine could optionally be run on its own CPU. The modern incarnation of NetWare's clustering, Novell Cluster Services (introduced in NetWare v5.0), is very different from SFT-III. NetWare SFT-III, ahead of its time in several ways, was a mixed success.</p>
<p>

NetWare 386 3.x was designed to run all applications on the server at the same level of processor <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/515373.xml">
memory protection</link>, known as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/3446185.xml">
ring 0</link>". While this provided the best possible performance, it sacrificed reliability. The result was that crashing (known as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../467/60467.xml">
abend</link>s</it>, short for <it>abnormal ends</it>) were possible and would result in stopping the system. Starting with NetWare 5.x, software modules (NetWare Loadable Modules or NLM's) could be assigned to run in different processor protection rings, ensuring that a software error would not crash the system. </p>
<p>

Many Netware intallations ran for months and even years without rebooting. By comparison, as late as Windows NT v4.0, many "best practices" recommendations included monthly or even weekly reboots due to memory leaks.</p>

, which replaced the Bindery with a global <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/334641.xml">
directory service</link>, in which the infrastructure was described and managed in a single place. Additionally, NDS provided an extensible <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/48031.xml">
schema</link>, allowing the introduction of new object types. This allowed a single user authentication to NDS to govern access to any server in the directory tree structure. Users could therefore access network resources no matter on which server they resided, although user license counts were still tied to individual servers. (Large enterprises could opt for a license model giving them essentially unlimited per-server users if they let Novell audit their total user count)</p>
<p>

Version 4 also introduced a number of useful tools and features, such as transparent compression at file system level and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../385/25385.xml">
RSA</link> public/private <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/10294.xml">

 Strategic mistakes </st>
<p>

Novell's strategy with NetWare 286 2.x and 3.x was very successful; before the arrival of <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/33438.xml">
Windows NT</link></family>
 Server, Novell claimed 90% of the market for PC based servers. </p>
<p>

While the design of NetWare 3.x and later involved a DOS partition to load NetWare server files, this feature became a liability as new users preferred the Windows graphical interface to learning DOS commands necessary to build and control a NetWare server. Novell could have eliminated this technical liability by retaining the design of NetWare 286, which installed the server file into a Novell partition and allowed the server to boot from the Novell partition without creating a bootable DOS partition. Novell finally added support for this in a Support Pack for NetWare 6.5.</p>
<p>

As Novell used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/421044.xml">
IPX/SPX</link> instead of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../476/15476.xml">
TCP/IP</link>, they were poorly positioned to take advantage of the Internet in 1995. The first implementation of TCP/IP for NetWare 3.x was not compatible with IPv4. This resulted in Novell servers being bypassed for routing and Internet access, in favor of hardware routers and <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">

 NetWare 4.1x and NetWare for Small Business: Novell begins to recover </st>
<p>

Novell priced NetWare 4.10 similarly to NetWare 3.12, allowing customers who resisted NDS (typically small businesses) to try it at no cost. </p>
<p>

Later Novell released NetWare version 4.11 in 1996 which included many enhancements that made the operating system easier to install, easier to operate, faster, and more stable. It also included the first full 32-bit client for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/18890.xml">
Microsoft Windows</link>-based workstations, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/50318.xml">
SMP</link> support and the NetWare Administrator (NWADMIN or NWADMN32), a GUI-based administration tool for NetWare. Previous administration tools used the <link>
Cworthy</link> interface, the character-based GUI tools such as SYSCON and PCONSOLE with blue text-based background. Some of these tools survive to this day, for instance MONITOR.NLM.</p>
<p>

Novell packaged NetWare 4.11 with its Web server, TCP/IP support and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/21979.xml">

 browser into a bundle dubbed <b>IntranetWare</b> (also written as intraNetWare). A version designed for networks of 25 or fewer users was named <b>IntranetWare for Small Business</b> and contained a limited version of NDS and tried to simplify NDS administration. The intranetWare name was dropped in NetWare 5.</p>
<p>

During this time Novell also began to leverage its directory service, NDS, by tying their other products into the directory. Their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">

, was integrated with NDS, and Novell released many other directory-enabled products such as <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../903/2581903.xml">

BorderManager</link></software>
.</p>
<p>

NetWare still required IPX/SPX as NCP used it, but Novell started to acknowledge the demand for TCP/IP with NetWare 4.11 by including tools and utilities that made it easier to create intranets and link networks to the Internet. Novell bundled tools, such as the IPX/IP gateway, to ease the connection between IPX workstations and IP networks. It also began integrating Internet technologies and support through features such as a natively hosted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/33455.xml">

<b>1.0</b>
In 2003, Novell announced the successor product to NetWare: <link>
Open Enterprise Server</link> (OES). First released in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../702/1559702.xml">
March 2005</link>, OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare (e.g. Directory Services, file-and-print) from the platform underlying the delivery of those services. OES is essentially a set of applications (eDirectory, <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

 Current NetWare situation </st>
<p>

While Novell NetWare is still used by many organizations, especially in education and government, its decline in popularity has been ongoing and dramatic since the mid 1990's. At that time, NetWare was considered the de facto standard for file &amp; print software for the Intel x86 compatible server platform. Nowadays (2007) Netware/OES solutions are typically used by large organisations, which need the flexibility of Novell solutions.</p>
<p>

Although Windows-based networks were consistently less reliable and more expensive, Microsoft began to shift market share away from NetWare towards their own products. Microsoft marketed directly to management through major magazines, whereas NetWare tended to be visible only to IT staff in specialist magazines. Novell was also slow to adapt their pricing models, and NetWare therefore seemed more expensive. Corporate decision makers were often influenced by initial licensing costs as opposed to long-term ownership costs, and NetWare was less cost-effective on this pricing basis.</p>
<p>

As a result many organisations that still use NetWare, eDirectory and Novell software have a hybrid infrastructure of Netware / OES server, Linux servers and Windows Servers.</p>
<p>

Open Enterprise Server is an active product, running Netware and Linux based services.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Netware Lite / Personal Netware </st>
<p>

In 1991 Novell introduced a radically different product - <link>
Netware Lite</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>. This quite different from the main NetWare line.
Rather than the specialist server operating systems, this was a peer to peer systems, where all PCs on the network could share their resources. It seems to have been a reaction to success of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../535/3174535.xml">
LANtastic</link>.</p>
<p>

The product line became <b> Personal Netware </b> in 1993.</p>

 Performance </st>
<p>

NetWare dominated the network operating system (NOS) market from the mid-80s through the mid- to late-90s due to its extremely high performance relative to other NOS technologies. Most benchmarks during this period demonstrated a 5:1 to 10:1 performance advantage over products from Microsoft, Banyan, and others. One noteworthy benchmark NetWare 3.x running <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

 services over TCP/IP (not NetWare's native IPX protocol) to a dedicated Auspex NFS server and a SCO Unix server running NFS service. NetWare NFS outperformed both 'native' NFS systems and claimed a 2:1 performance advantage over SCO Unix NFS on the same hardware.</p>
<p>

There were several reasons for NetWare's performance.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
 File service instead of disk service </st>
<p>

At the time NetWare was first developed, nearly all LAN storage was based on the disk server model. This meant that if a client computer wanted to read a particular block from a particular file it would have to issue the following requests across the relatively slow LAN:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Read first block of directory</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Continue reading subsequent directory blocks until the directory block containing the information on the desired file was found, could be many directory blocks</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Read through multiple file entry blocks until the block containing the location of the desired file block was found, could be many directory blocks</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Read the desired data block</entry>
</list>

NetWare, since it was based on a file service model, interacted with the client at the file API level:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Send file open request (if this hadn't already been done)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Send a request for the desired data from the file</entry>
</list>

All of the work of searching the directory to figure out where the desired data was physically located on the disk was performed at high speed locally on the server.
By the mid-1980s, most NOS products had shifted from the disk service to the file service model. Today, the disk service model is making a comeback, see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/266593.xml">
SAN</link>.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Aggressive caching </st>
<p>

From the start, NetWare was designed to be used on servers with copious amounts of RAM. The entire file allocation table (FAT) was read into RAM when a volume was mounted, thereby requiring a minimum amount of RAM proportional to online disk space; adding a disk to a server would often require a RAM upgrade as well. Unlike most competing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../411/41411.xml">
network operating system</link>s prior to Windows NT, NetWare automatically used all otherwise unused RAM for caching active files, employing delayed write-backs to facilitate re-ordering of disk requests (<information wordnetid="106634376" confidence="0.8">

). An unexpected shutdown could therefore corrupt data, making an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../834/41834.xml">
uninterruptible power supply</link> practically a mandatory part of a server installation.</p>
<p>

The default dirty cache delay time was fixed at 2.2 seconds in NetWare 286 versions 2.x. Starting with NetWare 386 3.x, the dirty disk cache delay time and dirty directory cache delay time settings controlled the amount of time the server would cache changed ("dirty") data before saving (flushing) the data to a hard drive. The default setting of 3.3 seconds could be decreased to 0.5 seconds but not reduced to zero, while the maximum delay was 10 seconds. The option to increase the cache delay to 10 seconds provided a significant performance boost. Windows 2000 and 2003 server do not allow adjustment to the cache delay time. Instead, they use an algorithm that adjusts cache delay.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Efficiency of NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) </st>
<p>

Most network protocols in use at the time NetWare was developed didn't trust the network to deliver messages. A typical client file read would work something like this:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Client sends read request to server</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Server acknowledges request</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Client acknowledges acknowledgement</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Server sends requested data to client</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Client acknowledges data</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Server acknowledges acknowledgement</entry>
</list>

In contrast, NCP was based on the idea that networks worked perfectly most of the time, so the reply to a request served as the acknowledgement. Here is an example of a client read request using this model:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Client sends read request to server</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 Server sends requested data to client</entry>
</list>

All requests contained a sequence number, so if the client didn't receive a response within an appropriate amount of time it would re-send the request with the same sequence number. If the server had already processed the request it would resend the cached response, if it had not yet had time to process the request it would only send a "positive acknowledgement". The bottom line to this 'trust the network' approach was a 2/3 reduction in network traffic and the associated latency.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Non-preemptive OS designed for network services </st>
<p>

One of the raging debates of the 90s was whether it was more appropriate for network file service to be performed by a software layer running on top of a general purpose operating system, or by a special purpose operating system. NetWare was a special purpose operating system, not a timesharing OS. It was written from the ground up as a platform for client-server processing services. Initially it focused on file and print services, but later demonstrated its flexibility by running database, email, web and other services as well. It also performed efficiently as a router, supporting IPX, TCP/IP, and Appletalk, though it never offered the flexibility of a 'hardware' router.</p>
<p>

In 4.x and earlier versions, NetWare did not support <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../443/3665443.xml">
preemption</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/32354.xml">
virtual memory</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/12293.xml">
graphical user interfaces</link>, etc. Processes and services running under the NetWare OS were expected to be cooperative, that is to process a request and return control to the OS in a timely fashion. On the down side, this trust of application processes to manage themselves could lead to a misbehaving application bringing down the server.</p>
<p>

By comparison, general purpose operating systems such as <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/31642.xml">
Unix</link></family>
 or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/18890.xml">
Microsoft Windows</link> were based on an interactive, time-sharing model where competing programs would consume all available resources if not held in check by the Operating System. Such environments operated by preemption, memory virtualization, etc., generating significant overhead because there were never enough resources to do everything every application desired. These systems improved over time as network services shed their “application” stigma and moved deeper into the kernel of the “general purpose” OS, but they never equaled the efficiency of NetWare.</p>
<p>

Probably the single greatest reason for Novell's success during the 80's and 90's was the efficiency of NetWare compared to general purpose operating systems. However, as microprocessors increased in power, efficiency became less and less of an issue.  With the introduction of the Pentium processor, NetWare's performance advantage began to be outweighed by the complexity of managing and developing applications for the NetWare environment.</p>
