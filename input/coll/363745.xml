In 1935 Smith married Rosemary Ansell, but the marriage ended in divorce two years later. By this time Smith was living with Olive Cook, whom he married in 1954. Smith was also a writer, producing photographic handbooks, including <it>All the Photo Tricks</it> (1940), for Focal Press. But it is for his photograph books he is best remembered. These include: <it>English Parish Churches</it> (1952), <it>English Cottages and Farmhouses</it> (1954), <it>The English House Through Seven Centuries</it> (1968), <it>Pompeii and Herculanaeum</it> (1960) <it>Rome: From its Foundation to the Present</it> (1971) and <it>England</it> (1971). Many of these were collaborations between himself and his wife, with Cook providing the text beside Smith's photography.</p>

He became ill in the spring of 1971, but <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link> was not diagnosed until a few weeks before his death on 29 December. It was only after his death that exhibitions of Smith's work appeared, with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../841/653841.xml">
monograph</link> finally being published in the 1980s.</p>
<p>

After Cook's own death in 2002, her papers and those of her husband were placed in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../109/498109.xml">
