Aero is intended to be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing than previous Windows versions, including glass-like transparencies, window animations and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../447/1053447.xml">

<p>

In addition to the Windows Aero visual style, Windows Vista includes a "Windows Vista Basic" theme which does not use desktop composition, and is geared towards lower-end machines that are not able to use the <component wordnetid="105868954" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</caption>
</image>
</p>
<p>

Windows Explorer's task pane has been removed, integrating the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane on the left contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated <it>Search Folders</it>. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the <it>Organize</it> button is clicked. It is also possible to change the layout of the Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as <it>author</it> or <it>subject</it>) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the <it>Details Pane</it> that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The <it>Navigation Pane</it> contains a list of most common folders (the <it>Favorites</it>) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

</system>
. By default it contains links to folders such as <it>Documents</it> and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The <it>Preview Pane</it> can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the <it><idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

</it> is installed. Also, if an application installs proper handlers for the preview pane (like <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/2712500.xml">

 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Windows Explorer also contains modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the <it>Details pane</it>, which displays metadata and information relating to the currently selected file or folder. The <it>Details pane</it> will also display a graphical thumbnail of the file (known as <it>live icon</it>). Furthermore, different imagery is overlayed on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).  </p>
<p>

The address bar has been modified to present a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/2929176.xml">
breadcrumbs</link> view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the Back button. This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to "Back" and selecting any folder from a list of previously accessed folders. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow to the right of the last item, or to click in the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the menu bar is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the menu bar appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files.</p>

 Icons </st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/355011.xml">
Icons</link> in Windows Vista are visually more realistic than illustrative. Icons are scalable in size up to 256 x 256 (64 KB). Required icon sizes are 16 x 16, 32 x 32, and 256 x 256. Optional sizes are 24 x 24, 48 x 48, 64 x 64, 96 x 96, and 128 x 128. Document icons show the actual document contents and several media types are distinguished by icon overlays (video, audio, photos). The icons can be zoomed in and out using a gradual slider or by holding down the <it>Ctrl</it> key and using the mouse scroll wheel. To optimize and reduce the size of large icons, icons may be stored as compressed <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/24306.xml">
PNG</link></format>
s. To maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of Windows, only larger sized icons can use lossless PNG compression.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
 Organizing &amp; metadata </st>

<p>

Windows Explorer includes significant changes from previous versions of Windows in terms of organization, navigation, filtering, sorting, grouping and stacking. Combined with integrated desktop searching, Explorer allows users to find and organize their files in new ways, such as "Stacks". The "Stacks" view groups files according to the criterion specified by the user. Stacks can be clicked to filter the files shown in Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer also sorts files on-the-fly automatically as they are renamed or pasted.</p>
<p>

The <it>Details pane</it> also allows for the change of some textual metadata such as 'Author' and 'Title' in files that support them within Windows Explorer. A new type of metadata called tags allows users to add descriptive terms to documents for easier categorization and retrieval. Some files support open metadata, allowing users to define new types of metadata for their files. Out of the box, Windows Vista supports Microsoft Office documents and most audio and video files. Metadata support for other file types can however be added by writing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/445959.xml">
shell extension</link>s. Unlike previous versions of Windows, all metadata is stored inside the file, so that it will always travel with the file. However, initially, users will be able to add metadata to only a few file types.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
 File operations </st>

<p>

When moving or copying files, Windows Explorer displays the full source and destination path, size and number of items and the transfer speed in megabytes per second (MB/s). If a conflict or error is encountered, it does not terminate the copy, move or delete operation. Rather, the file is skipped and the rest of the files processed. At the end of the operation, the errors are presented to the user with resolution options (if available). If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process. The user can also choose to apply the same action to the further conflicts, if any. Also, for first time in Windows, processing of dates when moving trees is somewhat consistent. Until now, every folder and subfolder obtained all three dates new to the time of operation. This was from the own nature of the operation at the file system level, create destination folders, move files, delete origin folders. Moved folders in Vista preserve creation and modification dates. Access date gets the time of the operation.</p>
<p>

Renaming a file, even when extensions are being displayed, highlights the filename without selecting the extension.</p>
<p>

In case a file is in use or "locked" by another application, Windows Explorer informs users to close the application and retry the file operation. Also, a new interface IFileIsInUse is introduced into the API which developers can use to let other applications switch to the main window of the application that has the file open or simply close the file from the "File In Use" dialog. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> If the running application exposes these operations by means of the IFileIsInUse interface, Windows Explorer, upon encountering a locked file, allows the user to close the file or switch to the application from the dialog box itself.</p>

The Start Menu in Windows Vista. The <it>Search Pane</it> can be used to search not only the programs menu but the <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../118/16575118.xml">
global search catalog</link></software>
 as well.
</caption>
</image>

In Windows Vista, the Start Menu has undergone some significant changes. One of the chief additions is a <it>Search</it> box, where users may begin typing immediately. The contents of the Start menu itself are indexed and searchable, besides the global search index. If indexing is turned on, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. This allows launching applications relatively quickly than navigating to the shortcut through cascading menus. The Start menu search also doubles as the Run command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu.</p>
<p>

Another major change to the Start menu in Windows Vista is that it no longer presents the <it>All programs</it> menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a <it>Back</it> button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it, the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present at the top of the right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The <it>Power</it> button's action is configurable through <it>Power options</it> in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../925/1326925.xml">
Control Panel</link>. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the <it>Lock</it> button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the <it>Lock</it> button is clicked.</p>
<p>

Like Windows XP, Windows Vista allows users to switch back to the pre-Windows XP style "Classic" Start menu, however, the <it>Search</it> box is not present on the Classic Start menu.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Default Programs </st>

<p>

A common issue in previous Windows versions was that competing applications doing common tasks each tried to associate themselves as the default for a certain file type using their own custom user interface. The default application information for a particular file type was stored in the registry on a per-machine basis, resulting in applications changing another user's default program when one user's defaults were changed and each application querying several different registry values when launched. In Windows Vista onwards, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../283/1206283.xml">
file type associations</link> and protocol handlers can be set on a per-user basis using the new <it>Default Programs</it> API, meaning default programs for file types and tasks can be different for each individual user. There is an API for calling a common <it>user interface</it> so applications no longer need to maintain their own file association UI. The Default Programs API gives applications a programmatic way to check for and discover other default applications, restore a single or all registered defaults, query for the owner of a specific default file association/protocol, launch the <it>Default Programs UI</it> for a specific application or clear all per user associations. Applications only need to registered at install time to be part of <it>Default Programs</it>.</p>

For all Vista Premium Ready PCs, when using Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, a preview of each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a cascading stack of their open windows using the mouse scroll wheel. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views of all of them simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are <it>Win+Tab</it>, which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, <it>Ctrl+Win+Tab</it>, which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and <it>Shift+Win+Tab</it> to flip through open windows backward).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> The window buttons on the taskbar show a thumbnail image of the window, when the mouse hovers over the button.</p>

Windows Vista features system-wide integrated search, called <it>Instant Search</it> (also known as <it>Windows Search</it>).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> <it>Instant Search</it> is designed to run significantly faster and offers more customized search capabilities. Search boxes have been added throughout the Explorer user interface, to the Start menu, Open/Save dialog boxes, and several of the applications included with Windows Vista. By default, Instant Search indexes only a small number of folders such as the start menu, the names of files opened, the Documents folder, and the user's e-mail. Beyond searching for files, search works with Help, Control Panel, Networking, and more. In Control Panel, for example, typing "firewall" will instantly return all applets that have to do with the system firewall.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>

The search engine uses indexing to allow for a quick display of results for a given search. Advanced options allow the user to choose the file type, how it should be indexed, the properties only, or the properties and the file contents. The Start menu search also doubles as the <it>Run</it> command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The indexed search platform is based on <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 2007) to use the indexing platform to store metadata and perform searches on Windows Vista or Windows XP (with the <link>
Windows Desktop Search</link> redistributable installed). This is in contrast to the search engine of Windows XP, which takes some time to display results, and only after the user has finished typing the search string. The Windows Vista search allows users to add multiple filters to continually refine search results (Such as "File contains the word 'example'"). It is also possible to search across RSS and <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 that are used by Windows Desktop Search as well. The IFilter interface can be implemented by software makers so that files created by their applications can be better integrated with search and indexing programs.</p>
<p>

Searching can also be done from the box at the bottom of the start menu, so it is possible to start a program from here by typing its name, for example "Calc" to start the calculator, "Word" to start Microsoft Word, "Mail" to open Windows Mail, a web address to start the default browser at a particular site, the default search engine, or even a folder name, filename or network share name.</p>
<p>

There is also the ability to save searches as a <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

</system>
 where opening the folder will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a <it>scope</it>) can be nested within the query string of another search.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> These virtual folders are also distributable via <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../489/93489.xml">
RSS</link>.</p>
<p>

Windows Vista also features an enhanced file content search for non-indexed locations, whereby the files being scanned are processed by the same IFilters that would be used for indexing, therefore offering more consistent results between indexed and non-indexed searches as well as the ability for third-parties to add support for additional file formats to have their content searched.</p>

On Windows Vista, Internet Explorer operates in a special "Protected Mode", which runs the browser in a security sandbox that has no access to the rest of the operating system or file system, except the <it>Temporary Internet Files</it> folder. This feature aims to mitigate problems whereby newly-discovered flaws in the browser (or in ActiveX controls hosted inside it) allowed hackers to subversively install software on the user's computer (typically spyware).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

Each button in the main menu, which contains sections such as "Music", "Videos", and "TV", gets encased in a box when selected, and for each selection, a submenu comes up, extending horizontally. When any of the options is selected, the entries for each are presented in a grid-like structure, with each item being identified by album art, if its an audio file, or a thumbnail image if it is a picture, a video or a TV recording, and other related options, such as different views for the music collection if "Music" is selected, extend horizontally along the top of the grid. Similarly, other items are identified by suggestive artwork. The grid displaying the items is also extended horizontally, and the selected item is enlarged compared to the rest.

Windows Vista includes <b>Internet Information Services</b> (IIS) version 7, which has been refactored into a modular architecture, with integrated .NET extensibility. Instead of a monolithic server which features all services, IIS 7 has a core web server engine, and modules offering specific functionality can be added to the engine to enable its features. Writing extensions to IIS 7 using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../003/1291003.xml">
ISAPI</link> has been deprecated in favor of the module API. Much of IIS's own functionality is built on this API, and as such, developers will have much more control over a request process than was possible in prior versions.</p>
<p>

A significant change from previous versions of IIS is that all web server configuration information is stored solely in XML configuration files, instead of in the metabase. The server has a global configuration file that provides defaults, and each virtual web's document root (and any subdirectory thereof) may contain a <b>web.config</b> containing settings that augment or override the defaults. Changes to these files take effect immediately. This marks a significant departure from previous versions whereby web interfaces, or machine administrator access, was required to change simple settings such as default document, active modules, and security/authentication.</p>

 is the new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/151967.xml">
windowing system</link> which handles the drawing of all content to the screen. Instead of windows drawing directly to the video card's memory buffers, contents are instead rendered to back-buffers (technically Direct3D surfaces), which are then arranged in the appropriate Z-order, then displayed to the user. This drawing method uses significantly more video memory than the traditional window-drawing method used in previous versions of Windows, which only required enough memory to contain the composite of all currently visible windows at any given time. With the entire contents of windows being stored in video memory, a user can move windows around the screen smoothly, without having "tearing" artifacts be visible while the operating system asks applications to redraw the newly visible parts of their windows. Other features new to Windows Vista such as live thumbnail window previews and Flip 3D are implemented through the DWM.</p>

Windows Vista includes a new version of Direct3D, called Direct3D 10. It adds scheduling and memory virtualization capabilities to the graphics subsystem and forgoes the current <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/8506.xml">
DirectX</link></software>
 practice of using "capability bits" to indicate which features are active on the current hardware. Instead, Direct3D 10 defines a minimum standard of hardware capabilities which must be supported for a display system to be "Direct3D 10 compatible". Microsoft's goal is to create an environment for developers and designers where they can be assured that the input they provide will be rendered in exactly the same fashion on all supported graphics cards. This has been a recurring problem with the DirectX 9 model, where different video cards have produced different results, thus requiring fixes keyed to specific cards to be produced by developers.</p>
<p>

According to Microsoft, Direct3D 10 will be able to display some graphics up to 8 times faster than DirectX 9.0c because of the new improved <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/5385679.xml">
Windows Display Driver Model</link>. In addition, Direct3D 10 incorporates Microsoft's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../657/2338657.xml">
High Level Shader Language</link> 4.0. However, Direct3D 10 is not backward compatible like prior versions of DirectX. The same game will not be compatible with both Direct3D 10 <it>and</it> Direct3D 9 or below. Games would need to be developed for both APIs, one version for Direct3D 9 and below if targeting Windows versions prior to Windows Vista and another version using Direct3D 10 if targeting only Windows Vista. Windows Vista does, however, contain a backward compatible Direct3D 9 implementation.</p>
<p>

The Direct3D 10 API introduces unified <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../119/441119.xml">
vertex</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/441115.xml">
pixel shaders</link>. In addition, it also supports <it>Geometry Shaders</it>, which operate on entire geometric primitives (points, lines, and triangles), and can allow calculations based on adjacent primitives as well. The output of the geometry shader can be passed directly onwards to the rasterizer for interpolation and pixel shading, or written to a vertex buffer (known as 'stream out') to be fed back into the beginning of the pipeline.</p>
<p>

D3D10 functionality requires WDDM (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/5385679.xml">
Windows Display Driver Model</link>) and new graphics hardware. The graphics hardware will be pre-emptively multithreaded, to allow multiple threads to use the GPU in turns. It will also provide paging of the graphics memory.</p>
<p>

The version of Direct3D 9 available in Windows Vista is called Direct3D 9Ex. This modified API also uses the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/5385679.xml">
WDDM</link> and allows Direct3D 9 applications to access some of the features available in Windows Vista such as cross-process shared surfaces, managed graphics memory, prioritization of resources, text anti-aliasing, advanced gamma functions, and device removal management.</p>
<p>

Windows Vista features <it>Windows Color System (WCS)</it>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> a platform for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../108/186108.xml">
color management</link>. Its goal is to obtain color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners. Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of color calibration automatic and transparent, as an evolution of ICC Color Profiles.</p>
<p>

Windows Color System is based on a completely new <it>Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine</it> (CITE). It is backed up by a new color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than 3), alternative color spaces and high dynamic range coloring, using a technology named <it>Kyuanos</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> developed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../034/196034.xml">
Canon</link>. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../191/429191.xml">
gamut</link> mapping algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also uses floating point calculations to minimize round-off losses, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a <it>color transform</it> according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.</p>
<p>

WCS features explicit support for LCD as well as CRT monitors, projectors, printers, and other imaging devices and provides customized support for each. WCS uses color profiles according to the CIE Color Appearance Model recommendation (CIECAM02), defined using <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 Mobile computing </st>
<p>

Some significant changes have been made to Windows Vista for mobile computing.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Power management </st>


<ss2>
<st>
 Sleep state </st>

<p>

In Windows Vista, the user can select a <it>Hybrid Sleep</it> option. Hybrid Sleep saves information from the computer's memory to the hibernation file on disk, but instead of turning off the computer, it simultaneously enters Standby mode. If power is lost, the system resumes from the existing hibernate image on disk. On a laptop, after the specified amount of time, it shuts down (hibernates). Hybrid Sleep thus, offers the benefits of fast resume when in Standby mode and improved reliability in case of power loss.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
 Fine-grained power configuration </st>
<p>

Windows Vista allows fine-grained control over power settings such as setting the power saving mode for wireless adapters, USB selective suspend, <bus wordnetid="102924116" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/143320.xml">
PCI Express</link></bus>
 link state power management, processor state etc and also allows configuring power settings for specific scenarios such as while sharing media files, giving a presentation, adaptive display mode and while indexing files.</p>
<p>

In earlier Windows versions, drivers sometimes prevented Windows from entering or reliably resuming from a power-saving state. This problem has been solved in Windows Vista. Applications can disable sleep idle timers when needed such as when burning discs or recording media. Away mode, which is not a power plan by itself but a feature, automatically turns off displays, video rendering and sound but keeps the computer working when the user is away from the computer. Optionally, it can also switch to sleep mode. Power settings are also configurable through Group Policy.</p>
<p>

The battery icon in the notification area has been improved to let the user more easily select a "Power plan". "Presentation Settings", through the Transient Multimon Manager (TMM), allow saving of display preferences when an external display such as a projector or external monitor is connected. The setting can be restored when the same device is re-connected later. Presentation settings are available only on mobile computers.</p>
<p>

Beginning with Windows Vista Service Pack 1, the operating system can turn off periodic VSync interrupt counting of CPU when the screen is not being refreshed from new graphics or mouse activity. This can result in significant energy savings.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref></p>
