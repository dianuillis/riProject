 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../148/45148.xml">
8-bit</link> series of computers. It was first introduced in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/34755.xml">
December 1983</link> for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/7293.xml">

http://www.devili.iki.fi/pub/Commodore/docs/magazines/gazette/MLX/dec83-MLX1C.jpg</weblink>. The following month, a <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/72155.xml">

 version ("Tiny MLX") was introduced. Generally, MLX listings were reserved for relatively long machine language programs such as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../340/2890340.xml">
SpeedScript</link></it>, while shorter programs were often printed in the form of "BASIC loaders" that used DATA statements to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/252279.xml">
POKE</link> the code into memory.</p>
<p>

The initial Commodore versions of MLX accepted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/8214.xml">
decimal</link> data. Each line of data contained six data bytes, plus a seventh byte which served as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../538/7538.xml">
checksum</link>. Although each line began with the memory address, and bytes were separated with commas, these did not have to be typed; the program auto-incremented the address and automatically printed the comma delimiters every three characters. Invalid keystrokes were filtered out. When a line was completely typed, it was automatically verified against the checksum value. If it matched, the user would be prompted for the next line. If not, a warning buzzer would sound and the invalid input would be discarded so that the user could retype the line. Several keyboard keys were redefined to create a makeshift <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../829/451829.xml">
numeric keypad</link>.</p>

Although the original MLX was a more efficient entry method than BASIC loaders with DATA statements, it had a number of issues. Foremost among them was that it POKEd the data entered directly into the affected area of memory. Since many machine language programs were located partially or entirely in the BASIC <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/25847.xml">
RAM</link> area, this meant that the user had to manually adjust the pointers to the top and bottom of BASIC RAM (using POKE statements provided in the article) before running MLX to keep the entry program from encroaching on the code and vice versa. If a program was entered in multiple sittings, this had to be done each time. Also, decimal storage required seven keystrokes for each two bytes entered (taking into account the checksums). Furthermore, many transposition errors were overlooked by the original MLX's unsophisticated checksum algorithm.</p>
<p>

Because of these issues, a completely new version of MLX (written by Technical Editor Ottis R. Cowper) debuted in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../846/34846.xml">
December 1985</link> issue of <it>COMPUTE!</it>. It appeared in <it>COMPUTE!'s Gazette</it> the following month. The new version stored typed data in a buffer, thus eliminating the need to reconfigure memory. The data format changed from decimal to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/13263.xml">
hexadecimal</link>, thus drastically reducing the number of keystrokes needed. Line length was increased from six bytes to eight, thereby reducing the checksum overhead. A more sophisticated hash algorithm was implemented to catch errors overlooked by the original, only failing to notice a substitution of 0xFF and 0x00 <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.devili.iki.fi/pub/Commodore/docs/magazines/gazette/MLX/jan86-MLX2A.jpg">

http://www.devili.iki.fi/pub/Commodore/docs/magazines/gazette/MLX/jan86-MLX2C.jpg</weblink>. This replacement version of MLX was very successful, and continued to be used until <it>COMPUTE!'s Gazette</it> switched over to a disk-only format in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../598/34598.xml">
December 1993</link>.</p>

Other versions of MLX</st>
<p>

Although they were not as widely used as the Commodore versions, COMPUTE! also released MLX for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../429/63429.xml">
Atari 8-bit family</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/22nd_century.xml">
Apple II family</link>. Atari MLX was based upon the earliest Commodore version and released alongside it in the December 1983 issue of <it>COMPUTE!</it> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue43/190_1_MLX.php">
http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue43/190_1_MLX.php</weblink>. Like its Commodore counterparts, its lines consisted of six decimal numbers each plus a checksum. Apple MLX, introduced in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../846/34846.xml">
June 1985</link> <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue61/349_1_Apple_MLX.php">
http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue61/349_1_Apple_MLX.php</weblink>, was the first MLX version to use the 8-byte-per-line hexadecimal listing format that would later be employed on the revised Commodore MLX. Although the lines appeared similar to those of their Commodore counterparts, the hash algorithms were different, presumably to prevent entry on the wrong system.</p>
