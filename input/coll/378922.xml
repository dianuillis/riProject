<p>

Basic prescription drug coverage</st>
<p>

Beginning in 2006, a prescription drug benefit, called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../773/2870773.xml">
Medicare Part D</link>, was made available through substantial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/6337653.xml">
out-of-pocket costs</link>. Coverage is available only through insurance companies and HMOs and is voluntary.</p>
<p>

Benefit: Enrollees will pay the following initial costs for the initial benefits described herein. A minimum monthly premium of $24.80 (premiums may vary), a $180 to $265 annual deductible, 25% (or approximate flat copay) of full drug costs up to $2,400.  After this initial coverage limit is met a period commonly referred to as the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../907/8031907.xml">
Donut Hole</link>" begins where an enrollee may be responsible for up to the full amount of drug costs.  The Donut Hole ends once the enrollee has met an out-of-pocket amount of $3850, beginning the next phase of coverage.  In the final coverage phase the enrollee will pay 5% of all drug costs.  </p>
<p>

A common misconception is the idea that the $2400 and $3850 are calculated the same way.  This leads many to think that the gap is an effectively simple dollar amount of $1450 (3850 minus 2400), which is not the case.  The $2400 is a total drug expense, meaning that the amount the manufacturer charges is applied to this total.  The $3850 is an out-of-pocket amount, meaning that only what the enrollee has paid towards their medications is applied.  For example; If an enrollee gets a prescription filled that would cost $100 without insurance, and the insurance gives a $25 copay, then the $25 goes toward the out-of-pocket (the amount that ends the Donut Hole) and the $100 goes towards the total drug expense (the amount that begins the Donut Hole).  This can be a nasty shock for those under the impression that both totals are of the same kind, as the Donut Hole will stretch much further when calculated correctly.</p>

Medicare Advantage plans</st>
<p>

With the passage of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../372/6151372.xml">
Balanced Budget Act of 1997</link>, Medicare beneficiaries were given the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">
health insurance</link> plans, instead of through the Original Medicare plan (Parts A and B). These programs were known as "Medicare+Choice" or "Part C" plans.  Pursuant to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/378922.xml">
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act</link> of 2003, the compensation and business practices for insurers that offer these plans changed, and "Medicare+Choice" plans became known as "Medicare Advantage" (MA) plans. In addition to offering comparable coverage to Part A and Part B, Medicare Advantage plans may also offer Part D coverage.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Changes to plans</st>
<p>

When the Medicare + Choice option was first offered, plans were established by several major health care insurers including Humana, Aetna, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans.  These plans were organized along traditional HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) business plans, but patients could freely switch back to traditional Medicare insurance. Some felt that these plans lacked the ability to truly manage care,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> and some plans did cut back their service areas and stopped enrolling new patients.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

With the MMA, new Medicare Advantage plans were established with several advantages over the previous Medicare + Choice plans:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

enrollees sign on for a whole year</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

care can be restricted to networks of providers</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

formularies can be used to restrict prescription drug choices</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

prescription coverage can be deferred to the patient or a Medicare Part D prescription plan</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

care other than emergency care can be restricted to a particular region</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

federal reimbursement can be adjusted according to the health risk of the enrollees </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The attraction for health insurers is the large difference between normal healthcare premiums and the federal Medicare premium.  Typical health insurance premiums (for someone working or healthy enough to be allowed to enroll) are generally $150 to $350 a month, depending on the level of service desired, health status, and deductibles.  For a healthy Medicare-eligible enrollee, the health insurer can receive around $800 a month, more than double the premium for younger citizens. This federal premium can increase to $2000 a month through a complex risk adjustment involving the health status of the eligible enrollee.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>  These plans are being aggressively marketed.  Among other benefits, the senior gets an immediate financial boost, as many plans let them skip paying Part B and Part D premiums, waive usual deductibles, and waive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/2151313.xml">
copay</link>s, all while covering preventive physicals and providing a prescription drug benefit.  While the insurance plan can realize immense initial profits, every single Medicare enrollee, no matter their underlying health status, can be expected to undergo between one and six life threatening major illnesses before they die. The pathology and illnesses associated with aging are innumerable and ultimately unbeatable. </p>
<p>

The ultimate economic viability of a Medicare Advantage plan will not be known for 10 to 15 years.  For seniors, the initial cost savings is balanced against insurance companies’ healthcare rationing through restrictive prescription drug formularies, requiring documentation of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/5483190.xml">
medical necessity</link> for imaging studies such as CT scans and MRIs, decreasing physician access, and rationing of lab tests, and ancillary care.</p>

</ss1>

<sec>
<st>
Other provisions</st>
<p>

While nearly all agreed that some form of prescription drug benefit would be included, other provisions were the subject of prolonged debate in <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
Congress</link></legislature>
.  The complex legislation also changes Medicare in the following ways:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

it mandates a six-city trial of a partly-privatized Medicare system (by 2010); </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

</list>
</p>
<p>

One of the little known features of the 2003 legislation is that means testing for Medicare B (medical insurance) begins in 2007.</p>

Legislative history</st>
<p>

The bill was debated and negotiated for nearly six years in Congress, and finally passed amid unusual circumstances.  Several times in the legislative process the bill had appeared to have failed, but each time was saved when a couple of Congressmen and Senators switched positions on the bill.</p>
<p>

. All that day and the next the bill was debated, and it was apparent that the bill would be very divisive. In the early morning of June 27, a floor vote was taken.  After the initial electronic vote, the count stood at 214 yeas, 218 nays. </p>
<p>

Three Republican representatives then changed their votes. One opponent of the bill, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../388/699388.xml">

<p>

The Senate's consideration of the conference report was somewhat less heated, as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../321/62321.xml">

Aftermath</st>
<p>

In July 2004, it was revealed that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../165/5765165.xml">
Thomas A. Scully</link>, Medicare Administrator, had ordered Richard Foster, a Medicare <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../405/43405.xml">
actuary</link>, to withhold information from Congress on pain of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../343/611343.xml">
termination</link>. Foster had projected that the bill would cost at least 139 billion dollars more than the White House was claiming.</p>
