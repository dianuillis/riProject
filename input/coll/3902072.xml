Caremark, formerly known as <b>Caremark Rx</b>, was founded in 1993 in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../427/85427.xml">

 as <b>MedPartners, Inc.</b> by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/1520220.xml">
HealthSouth Corporation</link></company>
 along with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/1520252.xml">
Richard Scrushy</link>, former <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/52234.xml">
CEO</link> of HealthSouth, and one time HealthSouth <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/343044.xml">
Chief Operating Officer</link> Larry House as a physician practice management (PPM) company. After going public in 1995, MedPartners quickly became the largest PPM company through many acquisitions (see <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

).</p>
<p>

MedPartners originally acquired Caremark International which was founded as a unit of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../238/2432238.xml">
Baxter International</link></company>
 and was spun off from Baxter in 1992 as a publicly traded company. On May 15, 1996, Caremark International announced it would be acquired by MedPartners with MedPartners ending up with Caremark's PPM division and prescription benefit management (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/7855534.xml">
PBM</link>) division and disposing of Caremark's rehabilitation Business to HealthSouth.  It expanded to the distribution of drugs for other conditions, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/173072.xml">
human growth hormone</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/50603.xml">
multiple sclerosis</link>.</p>
<p>

In October 1997, <link>
PhyCor</link>, the second largest PPM at the time, announced they would be acquiring MedPartners for $8 billion in stock and assumed debt.  However the merger agreement was terminated in January 1998.  The companies cited significant operational and strategic differences as the reason for the termination of the merger.<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/1998/01/05/daily11.html">
http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/1998/01/05/daily11.html</weblink>  MedPartners then announced that they would suffer a net loss of $841 million for the 4th quarter of 1997. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.answers.com/topic/mac-crawford?cat=biz-fin">
http://www.answers.com/topic/mac-crawford?cat=biz-fin</weblink>. Chairman, President and CEO Larry House resigned with Richard Scrushy taking over as interim Chairman, President and CEO. Scrushy announced that he would not change his role at HealthSouth as a result of him taking over at MedPartners. On March 18, 1998, Scrushy chose Edwin "Mac" Crawford to become the new President and CEO of MedPartners. Scrushy remaind as Chairman until November 1998, but remained on the board. After taking over, Mac Crawford announced that MedPartners was exiting its PPM business and refocusing on its PBM business. In 2000, after it had sold all of its PPM practices, MedPartners changed its name to Caremark Rx. In 2001 Scrushy sold his remaining shares in Caremark and left its board to continue as Chairman and CEO of HealthSouth.</p>
<p>

In 2003 it merged with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/3640023.xml">
AdvancePCS</link> seen as a key move in ensuring the growth and profitability of the company.  By retaining key leaders (although no senior management) from the AdvancePCS organization, and adopting many of its key principles, Caremark Rx was able to bolster its position within the PBM industry. </p>

In 2004, Caremark completed the move of its headquarters from <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

"The Caremark shareholder vote had been delayed twice because of a pension fund shareholder's lawsuit that claimed Caremark executives struck a bargain that favored company insiders over regular shareholders.
Although the petition failed to stop the CVS deal, it revealed documents showing that Crawford negotiated jobs for himself, his son and other executives, won protection for the Caremark board from an ongoing investigation into backdating of stock options and guaranteed at least some Caremark directors would serve on the new company's board."</p>
