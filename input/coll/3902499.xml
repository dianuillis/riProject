Background</st>
<p>

Mercola is a 1976 graduate of the University of Illinois and a 1982 graduate of the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>  According to Mercola's website, he is a former Chairman of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/1656748.xml">

Diet</st>
<p>

Mercola considers diet to be among the most important lifestyle changes for enhancing well-being and longevity. He claims that a well-balanced diet should include mostly natural, unprocessed foods, while excluding processed and artificial foods. He sees value in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/215509.xml">
paleolithic diet</link>s and advocates tailoring food consumption to individualized <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../701/1543701.xml">
metabolic typing</link>, developed by <link>
William Wolcott</link> and promoted in a book by Mercola. He encourages using water filters, including the process of reverse osmosis, to purify drinking water, and opposes water chlorination and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../808/1991808.xml">
fluoridation</link>.</p>

Controversial dietary advice</st>
<p>

Joseph Mercola's dietary recommendations often put him at odds with mainstream dietary advice. The elimination of grains from the diet goes against the recommendation of the USDA food pyramid, where grains are viewed as a staple food. Mercola, however, points to theories on food intolerances involving <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../152/13152.xml">
gluten</link>, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../526/63526.xml">
celiac sprue</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../989/6945989.xml">
wheat allergy</link>, and the relatively new introduction of grains into the human diet and theories that sugar and starch are associated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/1609070.xml">
hyperinsulinemia</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../448/54448.xml">
insulin resistance</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>
<p>

Some dietary fats he promotes are also high in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/264746.xml">
saturated fat</link>s, including unrefined
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/239915.xml">
coconut oil</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> which contains a form of saturated fat called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../717/5683717.xml">
medium chain triglycerides</link>. Mercola's claims in his book "The Total Health Program." that this particular type of saturated fat bypasses normal saturated fat digestive pathways in the body, and is turned into energy instead of clinging to arteries and veins. While saturated fats are considered by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/581673.xml">
American Heart Association</link> as contributing to heart disease<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>, a number of scientists (such as those from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/9018783.xml">
The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics</link>) dispute this claim, stating that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../410/6176410.xml">
lipid hypothesis</link> has not been validated to scientific standards.</p>
<p>

Mercola.com has hosted negative articles<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../017/58017.xml">
microwave oven</link>s, calling them dangerous, citing accidents, lawsuits, biochemical changes and other health reservations about the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../956/1710956.xml">
chemical effects</link> of microwaving food. He also offers non-microwave, convection ovens for sale in his store.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Mercola controversially<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> claims, "<it>Microwaves may also cause pathological changes in your body. Once a food's structure is altered, it cannot perform the desired function in your body.

These reductions may contribute to anemia, rheumatism, fever and thyroid deficiency.</it>"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> </p>
<p>

In supporting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/23311.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Raw+milk%22])">
raw milk</link>, Mercola is very critical of requirements for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/23311.xml">
pasteurization</link>, stating that it is unnecessary if cows are raised under healthy conditions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> He claims that raw milk is one of the finest sources of protein and calcium available,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> His main concern is that the high temperatures during pasteurization will destroy the valuable enzymes in milk and create converted proteins the body was never designed to handle.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> </p>
<p>

Mercola is also against <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/209207.xml">
homogenization</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> He asserts that it causes fat globules to surround the enzyme <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/97644.xml">
xanthine oxidase</link> (XO), which prevents the stomach from breaking down XO and allows XO to be absorbed intact into the bloodstream. He relates this additional bovine XO as a possible source of harmful oxidative stress contributory to heart failure and increased uric acid levels associated with gout.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>

 for treatment, and favors natural food choices, lifestyle modifications and energy psychology tools to address emotional challenges. He views these as safer and more effective options, because they address what he believes to be the 'root causes' of disease rather than simply treating symptoms by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/275509.xml">
palliative</link> means. He states that drug companies profoundly influence both government health agencies and the mainstream medical community, which in turn promote medical practices that are beneficial to drug companies but harmful to the patient. Typical supplements he promotes are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../265/866265.xml">

Mercola is especially critical of new drugs, as well as the economic and political powers which might influence their acceptance.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> He wrote an early drug warning on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../807/648807.xml">

<st>
Vaccination</st>
<p>

Among Mercola's most controversial recommendations are his expressed concerns that too many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/32653.xml">
vaccine</link>s are used too soon during infancy.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> He believes that some subpopulations (e.g. neonates, elderly, chronically ill) may be less suitable for certain vaccines, and that flu vaccines are still formulated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../998/221998.xml">
thimerosal</link> and other undesirable adjuvants unsuitable for use. He asserts that the slow phasedown for millions of existing doses of childhood vaccines containing mercury is against the public's greater interests.</p>
<p>

Mercola hosts vaccine critics on his webpages, advocates preventive measures
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> as part of an alternative immunization schedule, and strongly criticizes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../705/1045705.xml">
influenza vaccine</link>s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> He questions the projected epidemic threat and severity of influenza, the flu vaccine's safety <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref> and efficacy,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> and the possibility of harm to an individual's immune system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref></p>
<p>

Mercola claims that some chemicals used to control <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../965/19178965.xml">
fungi</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/9028799.xml">

Thimerosal</link> are given within a period of time. He also expresses concern about potentially cancer-linked components in vaccines such as thimersol, and historically, SV40 virus contaminating early polio vaccines.

In his book <it>The Great Bird Flu Hoax</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref>
he appears to take a stronger anti-pharmaceutical industry stance by accusing them of a fear-mongering marketing campaign against the public, as allegedly occurred with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/1516915.xml">
Swine Flu</link> scare of the 1970s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref></p>
<p>

In supporting this stance, Mercola often has wholly critical views of those working in governmental health care, as well as towards international health organizations. Mercola makes an extensive argument that disease alerts such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/1516915.xml">
swine flu</link> and their resulting immunizations were actually false alarms put forth to terrify the public.</p>

Mercola was raised as a Catholic. Later in life he switched to evangelical Christianity, but now calls himself <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/28387.xml">
spiritual</link> rather than <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../414/25414.xml">

Criticisms of Mercola</st>
<p>

Some of the criticism of Joseph Mercola is similar to criticism made against non-mainstream and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/1845.xml">
alternative medicine</link> in general.  Mercola is often viewed in this light by his promotion and marketing of non-pharmaceutical approaches. While certain advice, such as good diet and exercise, are not so criticized, he promotes a variety of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/1845.xml">
alternative medicine</link> that often take the place of the pharmaceutical approaches he mostly discourages. </p>
