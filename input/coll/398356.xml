<b>Corporate social responsibility</b> (CSR, also called corporate responsibility, corporate citizenship, responsible business and corporate social opportunity<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>) is a concept whereby <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/105070.xml">
organizations</link> consider the interests of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/37235.xml">
society</link> by taking responsibility for the impact of their activities on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/234206.xml">
customers</link>, suppliers, <link>
employees</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/146081.xml">

communities</link> and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../881/9628881.xml">
stakeholders</link>, as well as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/17554500.xml">
environment</link>. This <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../792/218792.xml">
obligation</link> is seen to extend beyond the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/26783.xml">
statutory</link> obligation to comply with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../913/51913.xml">
legislation</link> and sees organizations voluntarily taking further steps to improve the quality of life for employees and their families as well as for the local community and society at large. <p>

The practice of CSR is subject to much debate and criticism. Proponents argue that there is a strong business case for CSR, in that corporations benefit in multiple ways by operating with a perspective broader and longer than their own immediate, short-term profits. Critics argue that CSR distracts from the fundamental economic role of businesses; others argue that it is nothing more than superficial window-dressing; still others argue that it is an attempt to preempt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/214491.xml">
multinational corporations</link>.</p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/4770.xml">
Business ethics</link> is a form of the art of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../988/988.xml">
applied ethics</link> that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment.</p>
<p>

In the increasingly conscience-focused marketplaces of the 21st century, the demand for more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/4770.xml">
ethical business</link> processes and actions (known as ethicism) is increasing. Simultaneously, pressure is applied on industry to improve <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../770/4770.xml">
business ethics</link> through new public initiatives and laws (e.g. higher UK road tax for higher-emission vehicles).</p>
<p>

Business ethics can be both a normative and a descriptive discipline. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. In academia, descriptive approaches are also taken. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the degree to which business is perceived to be at odds with non-economic social values. Historically, interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporate websites lay emphasis on commitment to promoting non-economic social values under a variety of headings (e.g. ethics codes, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../092/1159092.xml">
social responsibility</link> charters). In some cases, corporations have re-branded their core values in the light of business ethical considerations (e.g. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../720/18998720.xml">
BP</link></company>
's "beyond petroleum" environmental tilt).</p>
<p>

The term CSR itself came in to common use in the early 1970s although it was seldom abbreviated. The term <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../723/17243723.xml">
stakeholder</link>, meaning those impacted by an organization's activities, was used to describe corporate owners beyond <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/146081.xml">
shareholders</link> from around 1989.</p>

<p>

An approach for CSR that is becoming more widely accepted is community-based development projects, such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/8671422.xml">
Shell Foundation</link>'s involvement in the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.flowervalley.org.za/">

Marks and Spencer</link> is also active in this community through the building of a trade network with the community - guaranteeing regular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/49147.xml">
fair trade</link> purchases.  
Often alternative approaches to this is the establishment of education facilities for adults, as well as HIV/AIDS education programmes.  The majority of these CSR projects are established in Africa.  
A more common approach of CSR is through the giving of aid to local organizations and impoverished communities in developing countries. Some organizations do not like this approach as it does not help build on the skills of the local people, whereas community-based development generally leads to more sustainable development.</p>

Taking responsibility for its impact on society means in the first instance that a company accounts for its actions. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../952/18477952.xml">
Social accounting</link>, a concept describing the communication of social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large, is thus an important element of CSR.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

A number of reporting guidelines or standards have been developed to serve as frameworks for social accounting, auditing and reporting:

Potential business benefits</st>
<p>

The scale and nature of the benefits of CSR for an organization can vary depending on the nature of the enterprise, and are difficult to quantify, though there is a large body of literature exhorting business to adopt measures beyond financial ones (e.g., <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<statistician wordnetid="110653238" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

Deming</link></statistician>
</person>
's Fourteen Points, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/522230.xml">
balanced scorecard</link>s). Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> found a correlation between social/environmental performance and financial performance. However, businesses may not be looking at short-run financial returns when developing their CSR strategy.</p>
<p>

The definition of CSR used within an organization can vary from the strict "stakeholder impacts" definition used by many CSR advocates and will often include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../050/220050.xml">
charitable efforts</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../705/32705.xml">
volunteering</link>. CSR may be based within the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../053/46053.xml">
human resources</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/4522229.xml">
business development</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/24389.xml">
public relations</link> departments of an organisation,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> or may be given a separate unit reporting to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../234/52234.xml">
CEO</link> or in some cases directly to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../347/632347.xml">
board</link>. Some companies may implement CSR-type values without a clearly defined team or programme.</p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/1511035.xml">
business case</link> for CSR within a company will likely rest on one or more of these arguments:</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Human resources</st>
<p>

A CSR programme can be seen as an aid to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../866/907866.xml">
recruitment</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/25828.xml">
retention</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> particularly within the competitive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/346628.xml">
graduate</link> student market. Potential recruits often ask about a firm's CSR policy during an interview, and having a comprehensive policy can give an advantage. CSR can also help to improve the perception of a company among its staff, particularly when staff can become involved through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../882/13821882.xml">
payroll giving</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../917/917917.xml">
fundraising</link> activities or community volunteering.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Risk management</st>
<p>

Managing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/25617.xml">
risk</link> is a central part of many corporate strategies. Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through incidents such as corruption scandals or environmental accidents. These events can also draw unwanted attention from regulators, courts, governments and media. Building a genuine culture of 'doing the right thing' within a corporation can offset these risks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Brand differentiation</st>
<p>

In crowded marketplaces, companies strive for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/644044.xml">
unique selling proposition</link> which can separate them from the competition in the minds of consumers. CSR can play a role in building customer loyalty based on distinctive ethical values.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Several major <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/18950900.xml">

 are built on ethical values. Business service organisations can benefit too from building a reputation for integrity and best practice.</p>

License to operate</st>
<p>

Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
taxation</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../149/153149.xml">
regulations</link>. By taking substantive voluntary steps, they can persuade governments and the wider public that they are taking issues such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/723482.xml">
health and safety</link>, diversity or the environment seriously, and so avoid intervention. This also applies to firms seeking to justify eye-catching profits and high levels of boardroom pay. Those operating away from their home country can make sure they stay welcome by being good corporate citizens with respect to labour standards and impacts on the environment.</p>

<st>
Criticisms and concerns</st>
<p>

Critics of CSR as well as proponents debate a number of concerns related to it. These include CSR's relationship to the fundamental purpose and nature of business and questionable motives for engaging in CSR, including concerns about insincerity and hypocrisy.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
CSR and the nature of business</st>
<p>
 
Corporations exist to provide products and/or services that produce profits for their shareholders. 
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>  <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/19640.xml">
Milton Friedman</link></scientist>
</person>
 and others take this a step further, arguing that a corporation's purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders, and that since (in their view), only people can have social responsibilities, corporations are only responsible to their shareholders and not to society as a whole. Although they accept that corporations should obey the laws of the countries within which they work, they assert that corporations have no other obligation to society.  Some people perceive CSR as incongruent with the very nature and purpose of business, and indeed a hindrance to free trade.  Those who assert that CSR is incongruent with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../416/5416.xml">
capitalism</link> and are in favor of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../088/93088.xml">
neoliberalism</link> argue that improvements in health, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/196206.xml">
longevity</link> and/or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../617/71617.xml">
infant mortality</link> have been created by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/69415.xml">
economic growth</link> attributed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../936/232936.xml">
free enterprise</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>
<p>

Critics of this argument perceive neoliberalism as opposed to the well-being of society and a hindrance to human freedom. They claim that the type of capitalism practiced in many developing countries is a form of economic and cultural imperialism, noting that these countries usually have fewer labor protections, and thus their citizens are at a higher risk of exploitation by multinational corporations.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

A wide variety of individuals and organizations operate in between these poles. For example, the REALeadership Alliance asserts that the business of leadership (be it corporate or otherwise) is to change the world for the better.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Many religious and cultural traditions hold that the economy exists to serve human beings, so all economic entities have an obligation to society (e.g., cf. <document wordnetid="106470073" confidence="0.8">
<written_communication wordnetid="106349220" confidence="0.8">
<writing wordnetid="106362953" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/10216593.xml">
Economic Justice for All</link></writing>
</written_communication>
</document>
). Moreover, as discussed above, many CSR proponents point out that CSR can significantly improve long-term corporate profitability because it reduces risks and inefficiencies while offering a host of potential benefits such as enhanced brand reputation and employee engagement.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
CSR and questionable motives</st>

<p>

Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies such as <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/361345.xml">
British American Tobacco</link></company>
 (BAT),<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> the petroleum giant <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../720/18998720.xml">
BP</link></company>
 (well-known for its high-profile advertising campaigns on environmental aspects of its operations), and McDonald's (see below) to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that some corporations start CSR programs for the commercial benefit they enjoy through raising their reputation with the public or with government. They suggest that corporations which exist solely to maximize profits are unable to advance the interests of society as a whole.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> </p>
<p>

Another concern is when companies claim to promote CSR and be committed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/29501.xml">
Sustainable Development</link> whilst simultaneously engaging in harmful business practices. For example, since the 1970s, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../627/2480627.xml">
McDonald's Corporation</link>'s association with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../244/471244.xml">
Ronald McDonald House</link> has been viewed as CSR and relationship marketing. More recently, as CSR has become mainstream, the company has beefed up its CSR programs related to its labor, environmental and other practices<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> All the same, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/42611.xml">
McDonald's Restaurants v Morris &amp; Steel</link>, Lord Justices Pill, May and Keane ruled that it was fair comment to say that McDonald's employees worldwide 'do badly in terms of pay and conditions'<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> and true that 'if one eats enough McDonald's food, one's diet may well become high in fat etc., with the very real risk of heart disease.'<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>  </p>

Marks and Spencer</link> (UK) in three flower and fruit growing communities across Africa.</p>
<p>

Critics concerned with corporate hypocrisy and insincerity generally suggest that better governmental and international regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures, are necessary to ensure that companies behave in a socially responsible manner.</p>

Drivers</st>
<p>

Corporations may be influenced to adopt CSR practices by several drivers<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref>.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Ethical consumerism</st>
<p>

The rise in popularity of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/441852.xml">
ethical consumerism</link> over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR. As global population increases, so does the pressure on limited natural resources required to meet rising consumer demand (Grace and Cohen 2005, 147). Industrialization in many developing countries is booming as a result of technology and  globalization. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumer decisions and are beginning to make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns. However, this practice is far from consistent or universal.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Globalization and market forces</st>
<p>

As corporations pursue growth through globalization, they have encountered new challenges that impose limits to their growth and potential profits. Government regulations, tariffs, environmental restrictions and varying standards of what constitutes labour exploitation are problems that can cost organizations millions of dollars. Some view ethical issues as simply a costly hindrance. Some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets, helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions to provide a subconscious level of advertising.(Fry, Keim, Mieners 1986, 105) Global competition places particular pressure on multinational corporations to examine not only their own labour practices, but those of their entire supply chain, from a CSR perspective. </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Social awareness and education</st>
<p>

The role among corporate stakeholders to work collectively to pressure corporations is changing. Shareholders and investors themselves, through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/9547490.xml">
socially responsible investing</link> are exerting pressure on corporations to behave responsibly. <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

</idea>
s are also taking an increasing role, leveraging the power of the media and the Internet to increase their scrutiny and collective activism around corporate behavior. Through education and dialogue, the development of community in holding businesses responsible for their actions is growing (Roux 2007).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Ethics training</st>
<p>

The rise of ethics training inside corporations, some of it required by government regulation, is another driver credited with changing the behaviour and culture of corporations. The aim of such training is to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear. Tullberg believes that humans are built with the capacity to cheat and manipulate, a view taken from (Trivers 1971, 1985), hence the need for learning normative values and rules in human behaviour (Tullberg 1996). The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of "dirty hands" (Grace and Cohen 2005), fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms. Organizations also see secondary benefit in increasing employee loyalty and pride in the organization. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/48337.xml">
Caterpillar</link> and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../987/354987.xml">
Best Buy</link></company>
 are examples of organizations that have taken such steps (Thilmany 2007).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Laws and regulation</st>
<p>

Another driver of CSR is the role of independent mediators, particularly the government, in ensuring that corporations are prevented from harming the broader social good, including people and the environment. CSR critics such as <official wordnetid="110372373" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../763/334763.xml">
Robert Reich</link></official>
 argue that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility by the way of laws and regulation that will allow a business to conduct themselves responsibly. </p>
<p>

The issues surrounding government regulation pose several problems. Regulation in itself is unable to cover every aspect in detail of a corporation's operations. This leads to burdensome legal processes bogged down in interpretations of the law and debatable grey areas (Sacconi 2004).  <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/12730.xml">
General Electric</link></company>
 is an example of a corporation that has failed to clean up the Hudson River after contaminating it with organic pollutants.  The company continues to argue via the legal process on assignment of liability, while the cleanup remains stagnant. (Sullivan &amp; Schiafo 2005). The second issue is the financial burden that regulation can place on a nation's economy. This view shared by Bulkeley, who cites as an the Australian federal government's actions to avoid compliance with the <treaty wordnetid="106773434" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/16775.xml">
Kyoto Protocol</link></treaty>
 in 1997, on the concerns of economic loss and national interest. The Australian government took the position that signing the Kyoto Pact would have caused more significant economic losses for Australia than for any other OECD nation (Bulkeley 2001, pg 436). Critics of CSR also point out that organizations pay taxes to government to ensure that society and the environment are not adversely affected by business activities.</p>

Crises and their consequences</st>
<p>

Often it takes a crisis to precipitate attention to CSR. One of the most active stands against environmental management is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../881/12282881.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/20642.xml">

, which required a recall of millions of toys globally and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. In another example, <misfortune wordnetid="114475405" confidence="0.8">

 and is gaining ground as companies are pressed to adapt to the demands of the global economy. For <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/426334.xml">
small and medium enterprises</link> (SMEs) in this region, adopting CSR practices can open doors to new market opportunities and bring a number of other benefits including reduced costs, improved bottom lines and public image, and greater opportunities to do business with other SMEs or larger firms.</p>
<p>

The levels of corporate citizenship are corporate governance law, corporate philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. Corporate citizenship, means adhering to laws, and complying with some standards. Corporate philanthropy means helping communities via social investments. Corporate social responsibility requires performance of one's obligations to stakeholders </p>
<p>

In addition to these benefits, adopting responsible management practices can also help smaller businesses access the capital they need to grow.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

To further promote the expansion of CSR among small and medium enterprises in the region, there are a number of obstacles to overcome: the lack of understanding among SMEs about CSR; the scarcity of trained experts in the region to build business capacity in this area; and insufficient shareholder or government pressure on companies to make their management records public.

 is working to address these challenges through projects aiming to raise awareness among SMEs in Latin America and the Caribbean about the benefits of CSR and to support smaller companies in their efforts to implement CSR measures.
