 History </st>
<p>

Computer Consoles Inc. (CCI, incorporated May 20, 1968) was founded to develop one of the earliest versions of a smart computer terminal, principally for the telephony market. Due to the state of the art in electronics at the time, this smart terminal was the size of an average sized office desk.</p>

 Automating Operator Services </st>
<p>

Due to the success of the smart computer terminal, and the expertise the company gained in understanding Operator Services, the company started development programs to offer networked computer systems that provided contract managed access time, specified as a guaranteed number of seconds to paint the operator's first screen of information, to various telephony databases such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../894/449894.xml">
Directory Assistance</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../270/41270.xml">
Intercept</link>. The largest such system was designed and installed for <commercial_enterprise wordnetid="108065093" confidence="0.8">

 Automatic Voice Response </st>
<p>

To provide higher levels of automation to operator services, CCI introduced in the early 1980s various Automatic Voice Response (AVR) systems tightly integrated with its popular Directory Assistance systems. AVR provided voice response of the customer requested data, almost universally starting the prompt with a variant of the phrase, "The number is". Early systems were based on very small vocabulary synthesised speech chips, follow-on systems utilized 8-bit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/41604.xml">
PCM</link>, and later ADPCM voice playback using audio authored either by CCI or the local phone company.</p>

 Digital Switching </st>
<p>

To provide even higher levels of automation, CCI started a very aggressive program in the early 1980s to develop a PCM digital telephone switching system targeted for automated, user defined call scenarios. Initial installations handled intercept and calling card calls by capturing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/502892.xml">

 PERPOS, Perpetual Processing Operating System </st>
<p>

To provide better control over transaction processing, significant improvements in fault tolerance, and richer support for networking, CCI developed PERPOS, a Unix derivative that provided integrated support for real-time transaction processing, load balancing, and fault tolerant features such as hot and cold standby.</p>

/VAX platform, it succeeded for solutions where processing power was paramount. Universities requiring time-shared compilation engines for their students were particularly keen. The machine suffered when applied to general purpose database application environments, not least because the I/O subsystem over-relied on the central processing power (much as the VAX did) and thus used relatively dumb I/O processors. The Power 6 running either version of Unix also suffered from the inefficient memory management inherent in BSD 4.3 [see The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System s. Leffer, [[Marshall Kirk McKusick]], M. Karels, and J. Quarterman]. The core of this was the use of a 512-byte page rather than a 4K-byte page. Leffer et al. suggest they did this due to concerns about VAX support of 4k dynamic paging. The Power 6 had no such problems, but no operating system to support it!
The final issue with the Power 6/32 running Unix was the lack for <link>
symmetric multi-processing</link>: All system calls would have to run on the "Master" processor, forcing a dual processing machine to reschedule a process from the "slave" processor for every system call. The neat result of this meant database benchmarks often ran faster on a single processor than a dual!</p>

-based office later grew to support the efforts of the U.S.-based CCI offices, eventually becoming a major research and development center for machine level/operating systems products, telephony products, office automation products (particularly for British and foreign language "OfficePower").  CCI Israel also undertook local development projects for major clients - notably Motorola and Israel Aircraft Industries. In the mid-1980s CCI-Israel introduced the U.S. companies' brand of 5/32 and 6/32 micro- and mini-computers to the local Israeli market.  CCI-Israel - through seminars and training groups - was also instrumental in developing and popularizing the Unix operating system and the C programming language in Israel. CCI-Israel was also responsible for establishing the first Unix "User Group" in that country.</p>

At this time CCI was organized as two major business units: one in Rochester ("CCI - Rochester"), which manufactured telecommunications equipment, and a Computer Products Division in Irvine ("CCI - Irvine"), which manufactured computer hardware.  Office systems software was produced at Reston, Virginia. In reality there was a third operation which was a financing group that held the commercial leases for equipment typically sold to telephone companies. At the time of the acquisition the lease base was rumored to be valued at over $700M US dollars.</p>
