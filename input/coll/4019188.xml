<p>

The Peace of Westphalia is said to have ended attempts at the imposition of any supranational authority on European states. The "Westphalian" doctrine of states as independent actors was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/21748.xml">
nationalism</link>, under which legitimate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../151/28151.xml">
states</link> were assumed to correspond to <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/21754.xml">

imagined communities</link>." </p>
<p>

The Westphalian system reached its apogee in the late 19th century. Although practical considerations still led powerful states to seek to influence the affairs of others, forcible intervention by one country in the domestic affairs of another was less frequent in the period between 1850 and 1900 than in most previous and subsequent periods (Leurdijk 1986).</p>
<p>

The Peace of Westphalia is crucially important to modern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../533/82533.xml">
international relations</link> theory, with the Peace often being defined as the beginning of the international system with which the discipline deals.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

International relations theorists have identified the Peace of Westphalia as having several key principles, which explain the Peace's significance and its impact on the world today:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The principle of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../791/28791.xml">
sovereignty</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../151/28151.xml">
state</link>s and the fundamental right of political <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../269/29269.xml">
self determination</link> </entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The principle of (legal) equality between states </entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

The principle of non-intervention of one state in the internal affairs of another state</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

These principles are common to the way the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/2940911.xml">
"realist"</link> international relations paradigm views the international system today, which explains why the system of states is referred to as "The Westphalian System".</p>
<p>

Both the idea of Westphalian sovereignty and its applicability in practice have been questioned from the mid-20th century onwards from a variety of viewpoints. Much of the debate has turned on the ideas of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/1789823.xml">
internationalism</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/46313.xml">
globalization</link> which, in various interpretations, appear to conflict with Westphalian sovereignty.</p>
<p>

A notable defence of Westphalian sovereignty is to be found in <philosopher wordnetid="110423589" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Revisionist view</st>
<p>

The above interpretation of the Peace of Westphalia is not without its critics. Revisionist historians and international relations theorists argue against all of these points.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Neither of the treaties mention sovereignty. Since the three chief participants (France, Sweden and Holy Roman Empire) were all already sovereign, their representatives saw no need to clarify this situation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> In any case, the princes of Germany remained subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor per the constitution.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

While each German principality had its own legal system, the final Courts of Appeal applied to the whole of the Holy Roman Empire — the final appellate was the Emperor himself, and his decisions in cases brought to him were final and binding on all subordinates.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> The Emperor could, and did, depose princes when they were found by the courts to be at fault.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></entry>

Both treaties specifically state that should the treaty be broken, France and Sweden held the right to intervene in the internal affairs of the Empire.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Rather than cementing sovereignty, revisionists hold that the treaty served to maintain the status quo ante. As such, the treaty cemented the theory of <it>Landeshoheit</it>, in which state-like actors have a certain (usually high) degree of autonomy, but are not sovereign since they are subject to the laws, judiciary, and constitution of a higher body.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>

Globalization and Westphalian sovereignty</st>

<p>

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the emerging literature on globalization focused primarily on the apparent erosion of <link>
interdependence sovereignty</link> and Westphalian sovereignty. Much of this literature was primarily concerned to criticize <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../911/2940911.xml">
realist</link> models of international politics in which the Westphalian notion of the state as a unitary actor are taken as axiomatic (Camilleri and Falk 1992).</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../317/9317.xml">

 concept of shared sovereignty is also somewhat contrary to historical views of Westphalian sovereignty.</p>

Military intervention</st>

<p>

Since the late 1990s, the idea of Westphalian sovereignty has been brought into further question by a range of actual and proposed military interventions in  the former <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

 among others.</p>

<ss1>

Humanitarian intervention</st>

<p>

Some of these, including the interventions in <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

, have been justified as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../283/3084283.xml">
humanitarian intervention</link>, aimed at preventing imminent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/12441.xml">
genocide</link> or large-scale loss of life.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../531/216531.xml">
Neoconservatism</link> in particular has developed this line of thinking further, to assert that a lack of democracy may foreshadow future humanitarian crises, or that democracy constitutes a human right on its own.</p>
<p>

There is, however, debate about whether recent infringements of state sovereignty, such as the 2003 <conflict wordnetid="100958896" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../324/5043324.xml">
Iraq War</link></conflict>
, really reflected these higher principles, or whether the real justification was simply that of self-defense or the promotion of political and economic interests, which is more consistent with the traditional view of Westphalian sovereignty.  A new notion of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../870/5493870.xml">
contingent sovereignty</link> seems to be emerging in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/8195726.xml">
international law</link>, but it has not yet reached the point of legal legitimacy.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Failed states</st>

<p>

A further criticism of Westphalian sovereignty arises in relation to allegedly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/145072.xml">
failed states</link>, of which <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/737.xml">
Afghanistan</link></country>
 (before <link>
the 2001 US-led invasion</link>) is often considered an example. In this case, it is argued that no sovereignty exists and that international intervention is justified on humanitarian grounds and by the threats posed by failed states to neighboring countries and the world as a whole. However, the 2001 invasion was justified more directly on the grounds of self-defense, as a response to the <terrorist_attack wordnetid="101246697" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
