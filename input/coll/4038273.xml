<b>Toxic Oil Syndrome</b> or simply <b>Toxic Syndrome</b> was the name given to an unusual <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../072/8072.xml">

 Overview </st>

<p>

The cause was traced to the consumption of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/2965997.xml">
rapeseed oil</link> that had been intended for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/14543.xml">
industrial</link> rather than <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/10646.xml">
food</link> use. It had been imported as cheap industrial oil by the company RAPSA at <link>
San Sebastián</link>, handled by RAELCA and refined by ITH in <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.8">

. It was sold as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>" by street vendors at weekly street markets and was therefore used on salads and for cooking. The commonly-accepted hypothesis states that toxic compounds, derived during the refinement process, used to remove the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../718/299718.xml">
aniline</link> and to denature oils, intended for industrial use was responsible.</p>
<p>

Once the origin of the syndrome was realised, public health officials organized an exchange programme, whereby those who had bought the oil could exchange it for pure olive oil, thereby quickly ending the outbreak.</p>
<p>

The conclusion that oil was the cause for TOS is based on strong <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/66997.xml">
epidemiological</link> evidence, since up to now, experimental studies performed in a variety of <technique wordnetid="105665146" confidence="0.8">

s have failed to reproduce the symptoms of human TOS. None of the in vivo or in vitro studies performed with toxic-oil-specific components, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/10975.xml">
fatty acid</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../718/299718.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Acylation%22])">
anilide</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/9675.xml">
ester</link>s of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../122/65122.xml">
PAP</link>, have provided evidence that these markers are causally involved in the pathogenesis of TOS. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

The fact that the first cases of the syndrome were located in Madrid, near the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/3434750.xml">
U.S.</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/843566.xml">
military base</link> in <link>
Torrejón de Ardoz</link>, and the secrecy surrounding the huge investigations, spread the idea of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../102/3406102.xml">
conspiracy</link>. Also, several of the affected by the TOS claim they never consumed that oil.  Although the oil was mainly sold on street markets, a considerable percentage of the patients were upper class. Another theory suggests the toxic reaction was triggered by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../629/959629.xml">
organophosphate</link> compounds used in pesticides<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, since it was found in almost all the patients tested for them.</p>
