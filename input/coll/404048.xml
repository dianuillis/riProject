artificial intelligence</link> in which the concept of what is now known as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../840/43840.xml">
Turing test</link> was introduced to a wide audience.<p>

Turing's paper considers the question "Can machines think?" Since the words "think" and "machine" can't be defined in clear way that satisfies everyone, Turing suggests we "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word "think", second he must explain exactly which "machines" he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative.</p>

Turing test</link></it>
</indent>

Rather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the "<link>
Imitation Game</link>".  It involves three participants in isolated rooms: a computer (which is being tested), a human, and a (human) judge. The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal. Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human. If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which, then the computer wins the game.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Turing writes 'What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?'"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

 notes, the question has become "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> In other words, Turing is no longer asking if a machine can think, he asking if a machine can <it>act like</it> it is thinking. This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of defining the verb "to think."</p>

</indent>

Turing also notes that we need to determine which "machines" we wish to consider. He points out that a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../800/7800.xml">
clone</link>, while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery—machines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules. He gave two reasons.</p>
<p>

First, there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist. They already did in 1950.</p>
<p>

Second, digital machinery is "universal." Turing's research into the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/30402.xml">
foundations of computation</link> had proved that a digital computer can, in theory, simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. (This is the essential insight of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../854/6854.xml">
Church-Turing thesis</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/71435.xml">
universal Turing machine</link>.) Therefore, if <it>any</it> digital machine can "act like it is thinking" then, <it>every</it> sufficiently powerful digital machine can. Turing writes, "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

This allows the original question to made even more specific. Turing now restates the original question as "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> This question, he believes, can be answered without resorting to speculation or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/13692155.xml">
philosophy</link>. It has become a straightforward question of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/27010.xml">
software engineering</link>.</p>

Nine common objections</st>
<p>

Having clarified the question, Turing turned to answering it: he considered the following nine common objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../503/30503.xml">
Theological</link> Objection</it>: This states that thinking is a function of man's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../052/177052.xml">
immortal</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/28297.xml">
soul</link>; therefore, a machine cannot think.  "In attempting to construct such machines," wrote Turing, "we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that he creates."</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<it> 'Heads in the Sand' Objection</it>: "The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful.  Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so."  This objection is a fallacious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../012/224012.xml">
appeal to consequences</link>, confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/18831.xml">
Mathematical</link> Objections</it>: This objection uses mathematical theorems, such as <link>
Gödel's incompleteness theorem</link>, to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../225/3729225.xml">
logic</link> can answer.  Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine.  (This argument would be made again by philosopher <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../060/344060.xml">
John Lucas</link> in 1961 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../269/23269.xml">

<it>Argument From <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/5664.xml">
Consciousness</link></it>: This argument, suggested by Professor Geoffrey Jefferson in his 1949 Lister Oration states that "not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>  Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test.  He adds, "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think]." (This argument, that a computer can't have <it>conscious experiences</it> or <it>understanding</it> would be made 1980 by philosopher <philosopher wordnetid="110423589" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<entry level="1" type="number">

<it>Arguments from various disabilities</it>. These arguments all have the form "a computer will never do <it>X</it>". Turing offers a selection:Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make some one fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.Turing notes that "no support is usually offered for these statements," and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future, or are "disguised forms of the argument from consciousness." He chooses to answer a few of them:</entry>
<entry level="2" type="number">

<it>Machines cannot make mistakes.</it> He notes it's easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake.</entry>
<entry level="2" type="number">

<it>A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought</it> (or can't be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../247/422247.xml">
self-aware</link>). A program which can report on its internal states and processes, in the simple sense of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/50485.xml">
debugger</link> program, can certainly be written. Turing asserts "a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter."</entry>
<entry level="2" type="number">

<it>A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour</it>. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<it>Lady Lovelace's Objection</it>: One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality. This is largely because, according to <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/974.xml">
Ada Lovelace</link></scientist>
, machines are incapable of independent learning. Turing contradicts this by arguing that Lady Lovelace's assumption was affected by the context from which she wrote, and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge, it would become evident that the brain's storage is quite similar to that of a computer. Turing further replies that computers could still surprise humans, in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

<it>Argument from continuity in the nervous system</it>: Modern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../226/21226.xml">
neurological</link> research has shown that the brain is not digital. Even though <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../120/21120.xml">
neuron</link>s fire in an all-or-nothing pulse, both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components. Turing acknowledges this, but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power.

<entry level="1" type="number">

<it>Argument from the informality of behaviour</it>: This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent. Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct, and that if on a broad enough scale (such as is evident in man) machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict. He argues that, just because we can't immediately see what the laws are, does not mean that no such laws exist. He writes "we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'we have searched enough. There are no such laws.'". (<philosopher wordnetid="110423589" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Hubert Dreyfus</link></philosopher>
 would argue in 1972 that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules, but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules. More recent AI research in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/46673.xml">
robotics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/1563306.xml">
