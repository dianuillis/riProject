 characters. Such domain names could contain letters with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../439/8439.xml">

. However, the standard for domain names does not allow such characters, and much work has gone into finding a way to internationalize domain names into a standard ASCII format, thereby preserving the stability of the domain name system.</p>
<p>

IDN has, by the standards of the Internet, a long history; it was originally proposed in 1996 (by M. Dürst) and implemented in 1998 (by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../241/1613241.xml">
James Seng</link> under the guidance of T.W.Tan). After much debate and many competing proposals, a system called <b>Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications</b> (IDNA
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>) was adopted as the chosen standard, and has been rolled out in several <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/31115.xml">
top level domains</link>.</p>
<p>

In IDNA, the term <it>internationalized domain name</it> means specifically any domain name consisting only of labels to which the IDNA ToASCII algorithm can be successfully applied. (For the meaning of 'label' and 'ToASCII', see the section <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22ToASCII+and+ToUnicode%22])">
ToASCII and ToUnicode</link> below.)  In March 2008, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/15285.xml">
IETF</link> formed a new IDN Working Group to update<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> the current IDNA protocol.</p>

 Internationalizing domain names in applications </st>

<p>

Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) is a mechanism defined in 2003 for handling internationalized domain names containing non-<message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

 can technically support non-ASCII characters, applications such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">
e-mail</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/33173.xml">
web browser</link>s restrict domain names to what can be used as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../421/611421.xml">
hostname</link>. Rather than redesigning the existing DNS infrastructure, it was decided that non-ASCII domain names should be converted to a suitable ASCII-based form by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/33173.xml">
web browser</link>s and other user applications; IDNA specifies how this conversion is to be done.</p>
<p>

IDNA was designed for maximum <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/4459.xml">
backward compatibility</link> with the existing DNS system, which was designed for use with names using only a subset of the ASCII character set. </p>
<p>

An IDNA-enabled application is able to convert between the restricted-ASCII and non-ASCII representations of a domain, using the ASCII form in cases where it is needed (such as for DNS lookup), but being able to present the more readable non-ASCII form to users. Applications that do not support IDNA will not be able to handle domain names with non-ASCII characters, but will still be able to access such domains if given the (usually rather cryptic) ASCII equivalent.</p>

 ToASCII and ToUnicode </st>

<p>

The conversions between ASCII and non-ASCII forms of a domain name are accomplished by algorithms called ToASCII and ToUnicode. These algorithms are not applied to the domain name as a whole, but rather to individual labels. For example, if the domain name is www.example.com, then the labels are www, example and com, and ToASCII or ToUnicode would be applied to each of these three separately.</p>
<p>

The details of these two algorithms are complex, and are specified in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/25540.xml">
RFC</link>s linked at the end of this article. The following gives an overview of their behaviour.</p>
<p>

ToASCII leaves unchanged any ASCII label, but will fail if the label is unsuitable for DNS.
If given a label containing at least one non-ASCII character, ToASCII will apply the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/1151230.xml">
Nameprep</link> algorithm (which converts the label to lowercase and performs other normalization) and will then translate the result to ASCII using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../586/380586.xml">
Punycode</link> before prepending the 4-character string "xn--". This 4-character string is called the <it>ACE prefix</it>, where ACE means ASCII Compatible Encoding, and is used to distinguish Punycode-encoded labels from ordinary ASCII labels.
Note that the ToASCII algorithm can fail in a number of ways; for example, the final string could exceed the 63-character limit for the DNS. A label on which ToASCII fails cannot be used in an internationalized domain name.</p>
<p>

ToUnicode reverses the action of ToASCII, stripping off the ACE prefix and applying the Punycode decode algorithm. It does not reverse the Nameprep processing, since that is merely a normalization and is by nature irreversible.
Unlike ToASCII, ToUnicode always succeeds, because it simply returns the original string if decoding would fail. In particular, this means that ToUnicode has no effect on a string that does not begin with the ACE prefix.</p>

The first label is processed by Nameprep to give <it>bücher</it>, and then by Punycode to give <it>bcher-kva</it>, and then has <it>xn--</it> prepended to give <it>xn--bcher-kva</it>.

Because IDN allows websites to use full Unicode names, it also makes it much easier to create a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../209/503209.xml">
spoofed</link> web site that looks exactly like another, including domain name and security certificate, but in fact is controlled by someone attempting to steal private information. These spoofing attacks potentially open users up to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/428364.xml">
phishing</link> attacks.</p>
<p>

These attacks are not due to technical deficiencies in either the Unicode or IDNA specifications, but because different characters in different languages can look the same, depending on the font used. For example, Unicode character U+0430, Cyrillic small letter a ("а"), can look identical to Unicode character U+0061, Latin small letter a, ("a") which is the lowercase "a" used in English. Characters that look alike in this way may be termed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../126/148126.xml">
homonym</link>s, <it>homographs</it>, or (less ambiguously) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/1590217.xml">
homoglyph</link>s. </p>
<p>

Although a computer may display visually identical or very similar <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/12904.xml">
glyph</link>s for two different characters, these differences are still significant to the computer when locating web sites or validating certificates.  The user assumes a one-to-one correspondence between the visual appearance of a name and the named entity, but when two names appear identical, this correspondence breaks down. </p>
<p>

By contrast, with the old set of a to z, 0 to 9, and the hyphen, there is little in the way of homographs.  l and 1 and 0 and o are the closest, and the combination "rn" looks similar to "m" in some fonts; however, most fonts make a noticeable visible distinction between them.  Still, this means even in the worst case a site like Google would still only need to register 8 names to protect against the homograph attacks.</p>
<p>

On December <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/34551.xml">
2001</link>, two Israeli researchers, <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Alex Gontmakher</link>, published a paper titled "The Homograph Attack",<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> an attack that used Unicode URLs to spoof a website URL. To prove the feasibility of this kind of attack, the researchers successfully registered a variant of the domain name "Microsoft.com" which incorporated Russian language characters.</p>
<p>

In general, this kind of attack is known as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/1609031.xml">
homograph spoofing attack</link>. This problem was anticipated before IDN was introduced, and guidelines were issued to registries to try and avoid or reduce the problem – for example, recommending that registries only accept the Latin alphabet and that of their own country, not all of Unicode. Unfortunately this advice was not followed by those in control of a number of major <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/31115.xml">

<p>

Since Internet Explorer prior to version 7 does not support IDNs, it is not vulnerable to this kind of attack. However, older versions of Internet Explorer can be made IDN-compatible by browser <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../659/23659.xml">

This is a change from the earlier plans to disable IDN entirely for the time being. [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279099#c135]</p>
