Without aircraft able to cover the long distance, activities in the South Atlantic would be down to the Royal Navy and the British Army. Plans were set in motion within the RAF to see if it could carry out any operations near the Falklands. </p>
<p>

The nearest useable airfield for RAF operations to the Falklands was <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/18962604.xml">

; a British territory but with an airfield, (the single-runway <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/932908.xml">
Wideawake airfield</link>) operated by the US.
Long range work was entirely dependent on the RAF's tanker fleet and so <aircraft wordnetid="102686568" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 to Ascension. The RAF tankers were capable of being refuelled in-flight which meant that it was possible to set-up relays of aircraft. 
The <aircraft wordnetid="102686568" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 was the last of the British <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../740/32740.xml">
V-bomber</link>s in operational use for bombing but their squadrons were imminent for disbandment. Based in the UK and assigned to NATO for nuclear operations, neither air-to-air refuelling nor conventional bombing had been practised for several years. </p>
<p>

At Marham the tanker force was set to planning refuelling operations to take one or more bombers to the Falklands and back. At <airport wordnetid="102692232" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/474984.xml">

, the retraining of crews in conventional bombing and in flight refuelling was begun. Aircraft were selected based upon their engines; only those with the more powerful <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../580/574580.xml">
Bristol Olympus</link> 301 engines were considered suitable. One of the hardest tasks was reinstating the refuelling system, which had been blocked off.</p>
<p>

One Victor was converted into an improvised photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Victors arrived at Ascension on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/1826.xml">

The first surprise attack on the islands, on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/1011.xml">
30 April</link>-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../348/19348.xml">
1 May</link> was aimed at the main runway at <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../436/191436.xml">

 Airfield. Carrying twenty-one 1,000 lbs <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../625/1123625.xml">
general-purpose bomb</link>s, the bomber was to fly across the line of the runway at about 35 degrees. The bomb release system was timed to drop sequentially from 10,000 ft so that at least one bomb would land on the runway<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>.</p>
<p>

For the mission, two Vulcans took off from <airport wordnetid="102692232" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../908/932908.xml">

; XM598 was the lead with XM607 as the reserve. Shortly after take off, XM598, commanded by Squadron Leader John Reeve, suffered a pressurisation failure (a rubber seal on the "Direct Vision" side window had perished) and was forced to return to Ascension. XM607, captained by Flight Lieutenant Martin Withers, took over.</p>
<p>

As well as XM598, one of the Victor tankers returned to Ascension with a faulty refuelling hose system and its place was taken by a reserve.</p>
<p>

The Vulcan was over its normal maximum take-off weight - each carried, as well as extra equipment like the DASH 10 and a chemical toilet, a highly experienced Air to Air Refuelling Instructor (AARI) from the Victor tanker force who would fly the Vulcan during refuelling - and fuel usage was higher than expected. As a result of the fuel demand and problems in flight with refuelling, two of the Victors had to fly further south than planned, eating into their own reserves, and one of these the last Victor to refuel the Vulcan was past the last refuelling bracket before turning home. Both Victors would need tankers sent south to refuel them so they could reach Ascension.</p>
<p>

XM607 made the final approach at around 300 ft above the sea. Before climbing to attack height the <artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

 was successfully locked on to offset markers on the coast and bombing handed over to the control system. The attack was delivered around 4 am local time. </p>
<p>

XM607 then climbed away from the airfield and headed nearly due north to a planned rendezvous with a Victor some way off the coast of <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../936/25936.xml">

. As it passed the British Task Force it signalled "superfuse" indicating a successful attack.  Its journey continued up within range of the South American coast to its rendezvous with a tanker. After contacting control with an update, the tanker was sent further south.
To help bring the two planes together a Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft was flown from Wideawake to the area. Without a in-flight refuelling system it was unable to loiter long. XM607 made the link and was able to return to Ascension.</p>
<p>

Northwood received the superfuse message by 8:30 and the MoD shortly thereafter. The news of the bombing raid was reported on the <network wordnetid="108434259" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The line of 21 bombs crossed the airfield and successfully cratered the runway with a single direct hit near the runway's mid point. However, it still remained operational for the Argentine C-130 Hercules transports. The bombs falling on either side of the runway caused slight damage to tented installations in the airfield perimeter<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. This was due to the careful dispersal of equipment by the base commander.</p>
<p>

The attack took the Argentinians (as well as the rest of the world) completely by surprise.</p>

The military success of <it>Black Buck</it> remains controversial to this day with some independent sources describing it as minimal<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>, the damage to the airfield and radars being quickly repaired<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>.

FMA Pucarás</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> As a result of the controversy a number of common misconceptions exist about the raid.</p>
<p>

Although commonly dismissed as British <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../203/23203.xml">
propaganda</link>, Argentine sources confirm claims that <it>Black Buck</it> was initially responsible for the withdrawal of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../343/172343.xml">
Mirage III</link>EA from operations over the islands in order to protect the mainland.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>
This dissuasive effect was however watered down when British officials made clear that there wouldn't be strikes on air bases in Argentina.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

There are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../771/31771.xml">
urban legend</link>s, that claim Argentine engineers building the runway plotted its position incorrectly on maps, leading to the British missing the runway.  The runway at Port Stanley was in fact built by British engineers, replacing an earlier temporary strip constructed by LADE.</p>
<p>

The purposes of the raid and its impact on the runway are also commonly misunderstood.  British air power doctrine recognises that attacks against the operating surfaces of runways can have limited effect.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>  Planning for the raid called for a bomb run in a 35° cut across the runway, with the aim of placing at least one bomb on the runway and possibly two.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>  The main purpose in doing so was to prevent the use of the runway by fast jets, in this respect the raid was successful as the repair to the runway was botched and subsequently there were several near accidents. However, it was realised at the time that the runway would likely remain open to use by C-130; the RAF routinely practises rough field take offs in their C-130.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

The Argentines left the runway covered with piles of earth during the day, leading to claims this caused British intelligence to surmise that repairs were still in progress and misleading the British as to the condition of the airfield and the success of their raids<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>.  In fact, the British were well aware that C-130 flights continued to use the airfield<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref> and attempted to interdict these flights leading to the loss of a C-130 on June 1,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref> which was not, however, engaged in any resupply mission.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>
<p>

Another common misconception is that the Argentine forces made no attempt to use the airfield at Port Stanley as a base for high-performance jets.  In early April, A-4Q Skyhawks of 3 Escuadrilla had flown Skyhawks in and out of the airfield.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>  Engineers of the Argentine army had added additional steel matting to extend the runway and were in the process of installing arrestor gear on the runway to enable short landings of combat aircraft.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>
<p>

To the British, the raids achieved a number of non-material objectives. These included: demonstrating their willingness to defend British territories from forceful invasion, signalling British intent to recapture the Falklands and showing their ability to attack Argentine forces on the islands. It also demonstrated the possibility of escalating the conflict in future by striking industrial targets on the Argentinian mainland.  Regardless of whether or not the British actually intended to pursue these options and escalate the conflict, the Argentinian leadership would have been fully aware of the implications.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> </p>
<p>

At the time, it was the longest bombing raid in history, covering over 4,000&nbsp;nautical miles (7,000&nbsp;km), all of which were conducted over the open sea. This record was not broken until an American B-52 flew from the USA to Iraq, and then returned to <airport wordnetid="102692232" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
