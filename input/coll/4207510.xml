<p>

The term oil is often used colloquially to refer to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link>.</p>

 Etymology </st>
<p>

<it>Oil</it> is a colloquial term used to refer to certain diverse and unrelated compounds sharing the same physical properties (such as viscosity and a hydrophobic nature), while ignoring related compounds. The compounds found in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/422873.xml">
cooking oil</link> are chemically very similar, almost identical, to those found in butter and very different from those found in diesel fuel, but while diesel is an oil, butter is not. Indeed diesel is once again very similar to natural gas, but gas is certainly not oil. This disparity stems partly from the fact that oils must be liquid at room temperature, and thus only certain liquid chemicals in many unrelated families are recognised, collectively, as 'oil'. Scientists, instead of using the term 'oil', adopt the terms <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/17940.xml">
lipids</link> and other terms to denote them instead.</p>

 Types of oils </st>

<ss1>
<st>
 Mineral oil </st>
<p>

All oils, with their high carbon and hydrogen content, can be traced back to organic sources.  Mineral oils, found in porous rocks underground, are no exception, as they were originally the organic material, such as dead <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/25011.xml">
plankton</link>, accumulated on the seafloor in geologically ancient times. Through various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../562/39562.xml">
geochemical</link> processes this material was converted to mineral oil, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link>, and its components, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../992/16992.xml">
kerosene</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/24006.xml">
paraffin waxes</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/23639.xml">
gasoline</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/81761.xml">
diesel</link> and such. These are classified as mineral oils as they do not have an organic origin on human timescales, and are instead derived from underground geologic locations, ranging from rocks, to underground traps, to sands.</p>
<p>

Other oily substances can also be found in the environment, the most well-known being <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../657/657.xml">
asphalt</link>, occurring naturally underground or, where there are leaks, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/224043.xml">
tar pits</link>.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
Petroleum</link> and other mineral oils, (specifically labelled as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../729/67729.xml">
petrochemicals</link>), have become such a crucial resource to human civilization in modern times they are often referred to by the ubiquitous term of 'oil' itself.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Organic oil </st>
<p>

Oils are also produced by plants, animals and other organisms through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/22208.xml">
organic</link> processes, and these oils  are remarkable in their diversity. Oil is a somewhat vague term to use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../180/5180.xml">
chemically</link>, and the scientific term for oils, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11042.xml">
fat</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/58256.xml">
wax</link>es, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/6437.xml">
cholesterol</link> and other oily substances found in living things and their secretions, is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../940/17940.xml">
lipid</link>s.</p>
<p>

Lipids, ranging from waxes to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/141922.xml">
steroids</link>, are somewhat hard to characterize, and are united in a group almost solely based on the fact that they all repel, or refuse to dissolve, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>, and are however comfortably <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/13036672.xml">
miscible</link> in other liquid lipids. They also have a high <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/5299.xml">
carbon</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../255/13255.xml">
hydrogen</link> content, and are considerably lacking in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../303/22303.xml">
oxygen</link> compared to other organic compounds and minerals.</p>

 Food oils </st>
<p>

Many edible vegetable and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/11039790.xml">
animal</link> oils, and also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/11042.xml">
fat</link>s, are used for various in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/422873.xml">
cooking</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/10646.xml">
food</link> preparation. In particular, many foods are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/53002.xml">
fried</link> in oil much hotter than boiling <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>. Oils are also used for flavoring and for modifying the texture of foods e.g. <technique wordnetid="105665146" confidence="0.8">

.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../381/80381.xml">
Health</link> advantages are claimed for a number of specific oils such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/22594.xml">
omega 3</link> oils (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/999306.xml">
fish oil</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/295711.xml">

 Fuel </st>
<p>

Almost all oils <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/5638.xml">
burn</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/202898.xml">
air</link> generating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../167/19593167.xml">
heat</link>, which can be used directly, or converted into other forms of fuels by various means.  For example, heating water into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../693/27693.xml">
steam</link> which is funneled into a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../848/30848.xml">
turbine</link> which turns a <invention wordnetid="105633385" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/82330.xml">
generator</link></invention>
, which then produces <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../3$00/Radeon_R$300.xml">
electricity</link>. Oils are used as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/10973.xml">
fuel</link>s for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../855/344855.xml">
heating</link>, lighting (e.g. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../902/191902.xml">
kerosene lamp</link>),  powering <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/5638.xml">
combustion</link> engines, and other purposes. Oils used for this purpose nowadays are usually derived from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link>, (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../547/392547.xml">
fuel oil</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/81761.xml">
diesel oil</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/23639.xml">
gasoline</link> (petrol), etc), though biological oils such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/188551.xml">
biodiesel</link> are gaining market share.</p>

 Heat transport </st>
<p>

Many oils have higher <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/4115.xml">
boiling point</link>s than water and are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../066/15066.xml">
electrical insulators</link>, making them useful for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../605/682605.xml">
liquid cooling</link> systems, especially where electricity is used. </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Lubrication </st>
<p>

Due to their non-polarity, oils do not easily adhere to other substances. This makes oils useful as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/18069.xml">
lubricant</link>s for various engineering purposes. Mineral oils are more suitable than biological oils, which degrade rapidly in most environmental conditions.</p>

<p>

Oils have been used throughout history as a fragrant or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../414/25414.xml">

anoint</link> kings and queens.  Oil that is associated with one or more saints is known as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/13146212.xml">
