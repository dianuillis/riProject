<b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../844/18844.xml">
Memory</link></b> is the ability of the brain to store, retain, and subsequently recall information. Although traditional studies of memory began in the realms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/13692155.xml">
philosophy</link>, the late nineteenth and early twentieth century put memory within the paradigms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/5961.xml">
cognitive psychology</link>. In the recent decades, it has become one of the principal pillars of a new branch of science that represents a marriage between cognitive psychology and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/21245.xml">
neuroscience</link>, called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../326/50326.xml">

Social anxiety</link></b> is an intense feeling of fear, apprehension or worry regarding any or all social  situations or public events. It is sometimes known as <b>social phobia</b> and, less commonly, social  trauma. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/18973869.xml">

<p>

Sufferers are typically more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../118/2772118.xml">
self-conscious</link> and self-attentive than others. As a  result, social phobics tend to limit or remove themselves from situations where they maybe subject to evaluation. Sufferers often recognize their fear is excessive or irrational, yet can't seem to break out of the cycle. As such, the diagnosis of social phobia is made only when the fear leads to problems with occupational functioning, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/289862.xml">
