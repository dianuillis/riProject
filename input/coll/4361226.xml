non profit organisation</link>, whose prime purpose is to advance the interests of airports and to promote professional excellence in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../575/37575.xml">

 History </st>
<p>

Before the establishment of ACI, the world’s airports were represented on the international scene by the Airport Associations Coordinating Council (AACC), created in 1970 by three international airport associations: the Airport Operators Council International (AOCI); the International Civil Airports Association (ICAA); and the Western European Airports Association (WEAA). Up until then, the three associations had collaborated on an informal ad hoc basis and had presented the interests of their memberships to other international organisations separately. </p>
<p>

As time passed, however, the growing importance of external factors on airport operation created the need for a formal relationship with governments, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/1942.xml">
airline</link>s, manufacturers and other parties concerned. This led to the establishment of AACC, with a view to formulating unified airport industry policies, furthering collaboration between its constituent associations, and representing them collectively with worldwide <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../422/58422.xml">
aviation</link> organisations and other relevant bodies. After WEAA was dissolved in 1985, AACC became a bipartite body.</p>
<p>

The decision to create ACI, which incorporated AOCI and ICAA and succeeded AACC, was taken in 1989. The Constitution of ACI was approved by AOCI and ICAA memberships in the autumn of 1990 and came into effect on 1 January 1991.</p>

 Regional associations </st>
<p>

ACI comprises five regions, each operating as an independent trade group under a collective affiliation through the ACI brand. Accordingly, the Geneva-based "ACI" is an umbrella organisation uniting the five regional associations.  </p>

The five regions of ACI are:</p>
