<p>

The movie is about one <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/1784354.xml">
Adnan bin Saidi</link>, a young Malay from <link>
Sungai Ramal</link> in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Selangor</link> who had joined the Malay Regiment just before the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../927/32927.xml">
Second World War</link> broke out in Asia. By the time the war broke out, he had been promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant, and was in command of Company C, 1st Battalion, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../429/1639429.xml">
Malay Regiment</link> after the death of the British company commander, Captain H R Rix. His exploits and bravery in combat while leading his men against the Japanese Imperial Army are legendary. The 2 known engagements he was involved in are:

Both battles occurred during the final phase of the Japanese Imperial Army's assault on the city of Singapore during the <conflict wordnetid="100958896" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. He later either died of his wounds or was executed after the battle. Three versions of his death are recorded. However, the official version will record that he was executed by Japanese troops in anger for his stubbornness in holding his position and inflicting large casualties on Japanese troops.

Alexandra Hospital Massacre</link></st>

<p>

Although not referred to in the film, there is a current theory that the subsequent Alexandra Hospital massacre was directly related to the great frustration felt by the Japanese soldiers due to the heavy losses suffered in overcoming the stout resistance put up by Lt Adnan's Company C on Opium Hill. With the loss of Company C, the remnants of the 1st Battalion withdrew leaving the way clear to the British military hospital at Alexandra and the subsequent massacre of the patients, doctors and nurses within.therefor Adnan</p>

Versions of Lt Adnan's death</st>

<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Version 1 - Official version: The official version as recorded by Japanese Imperial Army indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree. British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender and this has been repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign. The actual mode of execution was never officially recorded.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Version 2 - Film version: His death was not shown, but it was indicated in the closing credits that he and the surviving wounded in his company were tied to trees and bayonetted to death. This is probably the more correct version and in keeping with similar Japanese practice elsewhere.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Version 3 - A version which was shown on a local tabloid magazine, purportedly revealed by Lt Adnan's former aide, just before his death. This version could not be verified.</entry>

Criticism</st>
<p>

The film received criticism for using Malay actors to portray Japanese and English soldiers throughout the film. Further, the original English dialogue as spoken by the actors was voiced over by Malays speaking in halting and strongly accented English suggesting that there was an awkward attempt to alter the dialogue to give a different slant to the situations depicted and to portray the British in an unfavourable light.</p>
