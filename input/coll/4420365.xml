History of usage</st>
<p>

"Fureai" is a relatively recent addition to Japanese, first usage recorded in the 1970s and 1980s<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>.</p>
<p>

The acceptance of Fureai reflects Japan's socioeconomic transformation, particularly the collapse of traditional communities.  Most Japanese had been living, since its economic growth in 1950s and 1960s, in their rural community with agriculture, fishing and/or forestry as its main industry, with their own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../274/247274.xml">
extended family</link> where the elderly lived together with their offspring, but the popularization of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../132/193132.xml">
nuclear family</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../181/15181.xml">
individualism</link> made some people, especially the elderly, suffer from the social exclusion.  The traditional childrearing method also disappeared as a result of such a social change, giving rise to delinquency in the adolescence and the concept "Fureai" became popular in Japan as a means to solve such social issues by trying to create their emotional relationship.</p>

Difference from "Solidarity"</st>
<p>

Some people may point out that "Fureai" is similar to "Solidarity," but it is in fact wrong.  "Solidarity" refers to the union of people with different social status, such as students and workers or housewives and the elderly, in order to achieve their common social goal.  In "Fureai," on the other hand, people do not aim to achieve any goal at all but to offer some emotional connection to satisfy others.  They try to satisfy people psychologically by showing some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/806023.xml">
sympathy</link> to those who are emotionally thirsty just like they try to give water to those who are physically thirsty.</p>
