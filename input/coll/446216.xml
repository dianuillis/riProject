mathematics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/26685.xml">

Normative and descriptive decision theory</st>

<p>

Most of decision theory is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/1341369.xml">
normative</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/229136.xml">
prescriptive</link>, i.e. it is concerned with identifying the best decision to take, assuming an ideal decision maker who is fully informed, able to compute with perfect accuracy, and fully <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../032/61032.xml">
rational</link>. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people <it>should</it> make decisions) is called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/1190842.xml">
decision analysis</link>, and aimed at finding tools, methodologies and software to help people make better decisions. The most systematic and comprehensive software tools developed in this way are called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/469578.xml">
decision support system</link>s.</p>
<p>

Since it is obvious that people do not typically behave in optimal ways, there is also a related area of study, which is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/242260.xml">
positive</link> or <link>
descriptive</link> discipline, attempting to describe what people will actually do.  Since the normative, optimal decision often creates hypotheses for testing against actual behaviour, the two fields are closely linked.  Furthermore it is possible to relax the assumptions of perfect information, rationality and so forth in various ways, and produce a series of different prescriptions or predictions about behaviour, allowing for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice.</p>

This area represents the heart of decision theory.   The procedure now referred to  as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/9653.xml">
expected value</link> was known from the 17th century. <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</person>
 invoked it in his famous wager (see below), which is contained in his <it><link>
Pensées</link></it>, published in 1670.  The idea of expected value is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an expected value.  The action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

anchoring</link>.</p>
<p>

Castagnoli and LiCalzi (1996), Bordley and LiCalzi (2000) recently showed that maximizing expected utility is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the probability that the uncertain consequences of a decision are preferable to an uncertain benchmark (e.g., the probability that a mutual fund strategy outperforms the S&amp;P 500 or that a firm outperforms the uncertain future performance of a major competitor.). This reinterpretation relates to psychological work suggesting that individuals have fuzzy aspiration levels (Lopes &amp; Oden), which may vary from choice context to choice context. Hence it shifts the focus from utility to the individual's uncertain reference point.</p>

Intertemporal choice</link></st>

<p>

This area is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different points in time.  If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/163115.xml">
rates of interest</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/38286.xml">
inflation</link>, the person's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../669/18669.xml">
life expectancy</link>, and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../376/903376.xml">
subjective discount rates</link>.</p>

</ss1>

Competing decision makers</st>

<p>

Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is the business of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../924/11924.xml">
game theory</link>, and is not normally considered part of decision theory, though it is closely related. In the emerging <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/7049897.xml">
socio-cognitive</link> engineering  the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.
The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../527/1156527.xml">
signal detection theory</link> is based on the Decision theory.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Complex decisions</st>

<p>

Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them.  In such cases the issue is not the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, but the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../689/232689.xml">
Club of Rome</link>, for example, developed a model of economic growth and resource usage that helps politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations.</p>

Paradox of choice</st>
<p>

Observed in many cases is the paradox that more choices may lead to a poorer decision or a failure to make a decision at all. It is sometimes theorized to be caused by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/1220869.xml">
analysis paralysis</link>, real or perceived, or perhaps from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../888/324888.xml">

Alternatives to probability theory</st>

<p>

A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives. The proponents of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../180/49180.xml">
fuzzy logic</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../425/1504425.xml">
possibility theory</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/226660.xml">
Dempster-Shafer theory</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/4839173.xml">
info-gap decision theory</link> maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success.
Work by Yousef and others advocate exotic probability theories using complex-valued functions based on the probability amplitudes developed and validated by Birkhoff and Von Neumann in quantum physics. </p>
