In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/14423.xml">
higher education</link>, <b>college and university rankings</b> are listings of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/19725260.xml">
universities</link> and <link>
liberal arts colleges</link> in an order determined by any combination of factors.  Rankings can be based on subjectively perceived "quality," on some combination of empirical statistics, or on surveys of educators, scholars, students, prospective students, or others.  Rankings are often consulted by prospective <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../526/155526.xml">
student</link>s and their parents in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/1524959.xml">

In addition to rankings of institutions, there are also rankings of specific academic programs, departments, and schools. Rankings are conducted by magazines and newspapers and in some instances by academic practitioners. (See, for example, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../686/4750686.xml">

Webometrics</st>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../522/9809522.xml">
Webometrics Ranking of World Universities</link> is produced by the Cybermetrics Lab (CINDOC), a unit of the National Research Council (CSIC), the main public research body in Spain. It offers information about more than 4,000 universities according to their web-presence (a computerised assessment of the scholarly contents and visibility and impact of the whole university webdomain).</p>
<p>

The Webometrics Ranking is built from a database of over 15,000 universities and more than 5,000 research centers. The Top 4,000 universities are shown in the main rank, but even more are covered in the regional lists. Institutions from developing countries benefit from this policy as they obtain knowledge of their current position even if they are not World-Class Universities. </p>
<p>

The ranking started in 2004 and is based on a combined indicator that takes into account both the volume of the Web contents and the visibility and impact of this web publications according to the number of external inlinks they received. The ranking is updated every January and July, providing Web indicators for universities and research centres worldwide. This approach takes into account the wide range of scientific activities represented in the academic websites, frequently overlooked by the bibliometric indicators.</p>
<p>

Webometric indicators are provided to show the commitment of the institutions to Web publication. Thus, Universities of high academic quality may be ranked lower than expected due to a restrained web publication policy.</p>

G-Factor</st>
<p>

One refinement of the Webometrics  approach is the <b><weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.universitymetrics.com/g-factor">
G-Factor</weblink></b> methodology, which counts the number of links only from other university websites.  The G-Factor is an indicator of the popularity or importance of each university's website from the combined perspectives of the creators of many other university websites.  It is therefore a kind of extensive and objective peer review of a university through its website - in social network theory terminology, the G-Factor measures the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/1462712.xml">
centrality</link> of each university's website in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/766409.xml">

Professional Ranking of World Universities</st>
<p>

In contrast to the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the <b><weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ensmp.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html">
Professional Ranking of World Universities</weblink></b> established in 2007 by the <link>
École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris</link> intends to measure the efficiency of each university on a professional basis. Its main compilation criterion is the number of Chief Executive Officers (or number 1 executive equivalent) in the among the "500 leading worldwide companies" as measured by revenue who studied in each university. This is based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../425/17581425.xml">
Fortune Global 500</link> 2006 ranking. The <it>Academic Ranking of World Universities</it> and the <it>Professional Ranking of World Universities</it> could be considered as complementary and not exclusive since the first one measures the ability of the university to train academically preeminent people while the second one measures its ability to economically train preeminent ones.</p>

Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities</st>
<p>

The “<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ranking.heeact.edu.tw/en-us/2008/TOP/100">
Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities</weblink>” is a bibliometric based ranking produced by the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.heeact.edu.tw/">
Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan</weblink>. The 2007 performance measures are composed of nine indicators(11 years articles、Current articles、11 years citations、Current citations、Average citations、H-index、Highly cited papers、High Impact journal articles、Fields of excellence). The 2008 performance measures are composed of eight indicators. The indicator of “fields of excellence” used in the 2007 ranking has been removed and the weightings of the 2008 indicators have been adjusted accordingly.
The indicators representing three different criteria of scientific papers performance: research productivity, research impact, and research excellence. This project employs bibliometric methods to analyze and rank the scientific papers performances of the top 500 universities in the world.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

From 2008 HEEACT begins to provide six subject fields based rankings of world universities. The six subject fields are Agriculture &amp; Environment Sciences (AGE), Clinical Medicine (MED), Engineering, Computing &amp; Technology (ENG), Life Sciences (LIFE), Natural Sciences (SCI), and Social Sciences (SOC).The indicators employed in the field-based ranking and their respective weightings in the composite measures are identical to those used in the overall performance ranking.</p>

Maclean’s University Rankings</link>. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.macleans.ca/education/index.jsp">
http://www.macleans.ca/education/index.jsp</weblink> The criteria used by the magazine are based upon a number of factors, which include characteristics of the student body, classes, faculty, finances, the library, and reputation. The rankings are split into three categories: primarily undergraduate (schools that focus on undergraduate studies with few to no graduate programs), comprehensive (schools that have both extensive undergraduate studies and an extensive selection of graduate programs), and medical doctoral (schools that have a professional medical program and a selection of graduate programs). </p>
<p>

These rankings have received scrutiny and criticism from universities. For example, the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 there is no formal system of rankings for Colleges and Universities. Various rankings are carried out by interested organizations and associations, mostly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/18600737.xml">
newspapers and magazines</link> which carry out their rankings independently and based on factors they consider important to them. However the most followed and regarded rankings is done by a popular national weekly magazine <it><magazine wordnetid="106595351" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

In certain areas, even <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../391/5391.xml">

<p>

The ranking process of <it>India Today</it> starts in mid-March and the rankings are generally published in the second week edition of May each year right after the time when the results of the various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../472/10617472.xml">
boards</link> are announced and the students are deciding the colleges and universities to apply for graduate education. The rankings take into account a number of factors like (1) Reputation, (2) Curriculum, (3) Quality of Academic Input, (4) Student Care, (5) Admission Process, (6) Infrastructure, (7) Job Prospects etc. However these seven factors are the major ones and in fact each college is ranked in each factor while the overall ranking is determined based upon an undisclosed formula wherein different weights are assigned to each factor. Besides the top 10 colleges, the weekly also gives a list of other good colleges and universities which have failed to make it to the top 10 list but carry considerable prospects.Top 10 engineering colleges(latest Ranking Updated 25 Aug 2008) in India are 
1.IIT (Kharagpur)

This ranking was compiled as part of the Third European Report on Science &amp; Technology Indicators <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cordis.europa.eu/indicators/third_report.htm">
http://cordis.europa.eu/indicators/third_report.htm</weblink>, prepared by the Directorate General for Science and Research of the European Commission in 2003 (updated 2004).</p>
<p>

Being an official document of the European Union (from the office of the EU commissioner for science and technology), which took several years of specialist effort to compile, it can be regarded as a highly reliable source (the full report, containing almost 500 pages of statistics is available for download free from the EU website). Unlike the other rankings, it only explicitly considers the top institutions in the EU, but ample comparison statistics with the rest of the world are provided in the full report. The report say "University College London comes out on top in both publications (the number of scientific publications produced by the university) and citations (the number of times those scientific publications are cited by other
researchers)" however the table lists the top scoring university as "Univ London" indicating that the authors have confused the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../919/60919.xml">
University of London</link></university>
 with its constituent colleges.</p>
<p>

In this ranking, the top two universities in the EU are also Oxford and Cambridge, as in the Jiao Tong and Times ranking. This ranking, however, stresses more the scientific quality of the institution, as opposed to its size or perceived prestige.  Thus smaller, technical universities, such as Eindhoven (Netherlands) and München (Germany) are ranked third, behind Cambridge, and followed by <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../395/64395.xml">

 in the UK. The report does not provide a direct comparison between EU and universities in the rest of the world - although it does compute complex scientific impact score, measured against a world average.</p>

s (RAE) are attempts by the UK government to evaluate the quality of research undertaken by British Universities. Each subject, called a unit of assessment is given a ranking by a peer review panel. The rankings are used in the allocation of funding each university receives from the government. The last assessment was made in 2001. The RAE provides quality ratings for research across all disciplines. Panels use a standard scale to award a rating for each submission. Ratings range from 1 to 5*, according to how much of the work is judged to reach national or international levels of excellence. Higher education institutions (HEIs) which take part receive grants from one of the four higher education funding bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  </p>

As this system of universal inspection was hugely burdensome, it was replaced by a system of information provision, one part of which is a national student survey which has been run three times, and publishes scores which have been used by the league table industry.  The rankings have had to create artificial differences, however, as students are generally very satisfied.</p>

. The college rankings were not published in 1984, but were published in all years since. The precise methodology used by the <it>U.S. News</it> rankings has changed many times, and the data are not all available to the public, so <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/24116.xml">
peer review</link> of the rankings is limited. As a result, many other rankings arose and seriously challenged the result and methodology of <it>US News's</it> ranking, as shown in other rankings of US universities section below.

<caption>

Top 40 "National Universities" according to US News &amp; World Report, 2007
</caption>
</image>

The <it>U.S. News</it> rankings, unlike some other such lists, create a strict hierarchy of colleges and universities in their "top tier," rather than ranking only groups or "tiers" of schools; the individual schools' order changes significantly every year the rankings are published.  The most important factors in the rankings are: </p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Peer assessment: a survey of the institution's reputation among presidents, provosts, and deans of admission of other institutions</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Retention: six-year graduation rate and first-year student retention rate</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Student selectivity: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/225971.xml">
standardized test</link> scores of admitted students, proportion of admitted students in upper percentiles of their high-school class, and proportion of applicants accepted</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Faculty resources: average class size, faculty salary, faculty degree level, student-faculty ratio, and proportion of full-time faculty</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Financial resources: per-student spending</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Graduation rate performance: difference between expected and actual graduation rate</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Alumni giving rate</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

All these factors are combined according to statistical weights determined by <it>U.S. News</it>.  The weighting is often changed by <it>U.S. News</it> from year to year, and is not empirically determined (the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../554/5152554.xml">
National Opinion Research Center</link> methodology review said that these weights "lack any defensible empirical or theoretical basis").  Critics have charged that <it>U.S. News</it> intentionally changes its methodology every year so that the rankings change and they can sell more magazines. The first four such factors account for the great majority of the <it>U.S. News</it> ranking (80%, according to <it>U.S. News's</it> 2005 methodology), and the "reputational measure" (which surveys high-level administrators at similar institutions about their perceived quality ranking of each college and university) is especially important to the final ranking (accounting by itself for 25% of the ranking according to the 2005 methodology).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
<p>

A <it>New York Times</it> article reported that, given the <it>U.S. News</it> weighting methodology, "it's easy to guess who's going to end up on top: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/18426501.xml">

 round out the first three essentially every year. In fact, when asked how he knew his system was sound, Mel Elfin, the rankings' founder, often answered that he knew it because those three schools always landed on top. When a new lead statistician, Amy Graham, changed the formula in 1999 to what she considered more statistically valid, the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Global Language Monitor Internet-based rankings</st>
<p>

In September 2008, the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/8762611.xml">
Global Language Monitor</link> ranked the nation’s colleges and universities "according their appearance on the Internet, throughout the Blogosphere, as well in the global print and electronic media" <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>.  </it></p>
<p>

The schools were also ranked according to ‘media momentum’ defined as having the largest change in media citations over the last year, among other criteria.</p>
<p>

The purpose of the methodology was to perceive the schools through the eyes of the world at large since “Prospective students, alumni, employers, and the world at large believe that students who are graduated from such institutions will carry on the all the hallmarks of that particular school" <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref>.     </p>
<p>

GLM used its proprietary Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI) software for what it called its TrendTopper Media Buzz Analysis.  It employed the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s classifications to distinguish between Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges.  The schools were ranked according to their positions in early September, a mid-year snapshot, and used the last day of 2007 as the base.</p>

Other rankings of US universities</st>

undergraduate</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/153981.xml">
graduate student</link>s, dealing with individual student interests, fields of study, and other concerns such as geographical location, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../988/1170988.xml">
financial aid</link>, and affordability.</p>
<p>

One commercial ranking service is Top Tier Educational Services. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.toptiered.com/college-rankings.html">
http://www.toptiered.com/college-rankings.html</weblink> Student centered criterion are used and despite the two year completely updated study, the rankings are updated every quarter from new input data.  The criterion uses subjective data, such as peer assessment, desirability, and objective data, such as SAT, GPA.</p>
<p>

Such new rankings schemes measures what decision makers think as opposed to why.  They may or may not augment these statistics for reputation with hard, qualitative information. The authors discuss their rankings system and methodology with students but do not share their specific research tools or formulas. Again, the problem with such a ranking that uses subjective opinions is that it is very prone to personal bias, prejudice and bounded rationality. Also, public universities will be penalized because besides an academic mission, they have a social mission. They simply cannot charge as much money, or be as selective, as private universities. Also, the fact that the ranking service is a commercial company raises the question whether there are any hidden business motives behind its rankings.</p>

These rankings will be shared with 150 universities, along with critiques based on the work records of their graduates.

And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. <it>U.S. News</it> first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of <it>U.S. News</it>."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref></p>
