<b>IMS Learning Design</b> (IMS LD) is a specification for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../929/402929.xml">
metalanguage</link> which enables the modelling of learning processes. The specification is maintained by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/3417921.xml">
IMS Global Learning Consortium</link>.

Background</st>
<p>

IMS LD has its origins in the Educational Modelling Language developed at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/1046744.xml">
Open University of the Netherlands</link></university>
, with the IMS LD specification being released by the IMS Technical Board in February 2003.</p>

Description</st>
<p>

IMS Learning Design is a metalanguage for describing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../410/4542410.xml">
learning designs</link> that claims to be pedagogically neutral (according to their authors, it does not mandate a specific pedagogical approach). The specification can be likened to a stage-play:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

People act in different <b>roles</b></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Roles work towards specific objectives by performing learning and/or support <b>activities</b></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Activities are conducted within an <b>environment</b> consisting of learning objects and services</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

IMS LD is made up of three levels (A, B and C), with each level extending and encorporating the previous:

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Level A contains the core elements of the meta language</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Level B enables the use of generic properties and conditions</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Level C provides the ability to use notifications (enables activities to be set dynamically)</entry>
</list>
</p>

Use</st>
<p>

The specification is a method for describing teaching strategies (pedagogical models) and educational goals. The language is represented in XML which makes it machine readable; an IMS LD-aware tool is able to "play" a unit of learning. </p>
<p>

Although it is a relatively new specification (published in 2003), IMS LD has a moderately active community, mostly in Europe, carrying out a wide range of research and experimentation.</p>
