Applications</st>
<p>

A software program called MacroMaker, developed by Apple, was introduced with System 6.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> It allowed users to record a set of computer instructions, known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../089/4638089.xml">
macro</link>s. The most unique part of MacroMaker was its user interface, which aimed to look and act like a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../912/70912.xml">
tape recorder</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> MacroMaker was criticized for its lack of features when compared to <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

's AutoMac III, a similar product available at the time.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> Shortly after release of System 6, some users reported problems when using MacroMaker.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> MacroMaker was not compatible with <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 instead.</p>
<p>

System 6 used a utility called Font/DA Mover for the management of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/1094512.xml">
fonts</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/345365.xml">
Desk Accessories</link> (DA). This utility was created because DAs were not installed as applications, but instead were integrated into the system software file, similar to drivers. This meant that DAs could not be managed using the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../166/156166.xml">
Finder</link>, System 6's file management program. Font/DA Mover was also used to install fonts onto System 6 for use in software such as MacWrite, Apple's word processing software. Font/DA Mover was first developed by Bert Sloane in 1985, and was shortly after included on Macintosh system software disks as standard.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Several third party alternatives for font management were released, including Suitcase, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../634/1563634.xml">
Adobe Type Manager</link> and Font-DA Juggler Plus.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Cooperative multitasking made its Macintosh debut in March 1985 with a program called Switcher by <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher, and it was not built into the operating system. Instead, it was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called <technique wordnetid="105665146" confidence="0.8">

</technique>
 instead.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> Multitasking under System Software 6 was optional, startup could be set to Finder or MultiFinder. If MultiFinder was selected, the Finder and its functions continued to run when an application was launched. The MultiFinder environment allowed users to see past the windows of running applications to view Finder icons such as the Trash, or the windows of other applications running in the background. This was at the expense of more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/25847.xml">
RAM</link>, so it was not always possible to multitask if one of the applications required too large a portion of the available RAM.</p>

Limitations</st>
<p>

System 6 had several significant limitations, which were remedied in its successor, System 7. Unlike later Macintosh operating systems, System 6's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../076/7379076.xml">
Apple menu</link> was not customizable, and there was no application switcher menu in the upper right-hand corner of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../348/2399348.xml">
menu bar</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> System 6 supported 24&nbsp;<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/3364.xml">
bit</link>s of addressable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../847/25847.xml">
random access memory</link> (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8&nbsp;<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/19918.xml">
megabyte</link>s of RAM.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> This limitation was removed in System 7, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/32354.xml">
virtual memory</link> was introduced.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> System 6 also had a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/13777.xml">
hard drive</link> capacity limit; it supports up to 2&nbsp;<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../570/12570.xml">
gigabyte</link>s and 65,536 files on a drive.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

Management of files in System 6 was considerably different than both System 7 and later Macintosh operating systems. The absence of a Desktop folder on System 6 meant that files and folders could not be stored on the Desktop; instead, only references to files and folders could be kept.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Open <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/217500.xml">
dialogs</link> and Save As dialogs were primitive, mostly unchanged since 1984. A maximum of fifteen <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/345365.xml">
Desk Accessories</link> could be installed at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 used a single desk accessory for access to various control panels, instead of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../166/156166.xml">
Macintosh Finder</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> The Trash (or "Wastebasket" in the British version) was programmed to empty when the Finder terminated. If MultiFinder was not running, this would occur whenever an application was launched. The lack of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/720672.xml">
alias</link>es, shortcuts to files, was another limitation of file management on System 6.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Custom file and folder icons were not supported until System 7.</p>
<p>

As with previous system software versions, the user interface is largely unable to be modified or customized. This was later changed in System 7, which allowed the user to change the color and various other aspects of the user interface. In addition, System 6 did not allow users to change the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../512/1094512.xml">
font</link> sizes or styles for user interface elements such as menus and window titlebars.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> By 1989, the System 6 user interface was in need of a change.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> In comparison to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/40642.xml">
NeXTSTEP</link> operating system of the time, System 6 did not make use of sound, and its user interface presented several limitations in terms of file management and the way windows were displayed.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> System 6 did not include tear-off menus, or resizable menus as NeXTSTEP did.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>

The initial releases of System 6 were unstable; many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/1177478.xml">

Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem.

System 6 was officially supported by Apple for many different machines, some of which were shipped with System 6. It may be that some Apple computers for which System 6 was not officially supported may nevertheless be able to run it, perhaps with limitations.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>
