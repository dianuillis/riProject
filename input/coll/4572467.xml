<b>SSDN</b> is the Scottish Schools Digital Network, recently renamed 'Glow' in anticipation of its imminent roll out to every school in Scotland.  This is a major national <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../340/15340.xml">
ICT</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../322/30322.xml">
telecommunications</link> programme managed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../849/2905849.xml">
Learning and Teaching Scotland</link>. SSDN offers three key components to Scottish <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/9252.xml">
education</link>:</p>
<p>

SSDN Interconnect: A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/147184.xml">
broadband</link> network connecting up education in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../994/26994.xml">
Scotland</link></country>
. This includes all 32 education authorities and other key stakeholders such as Learning and Teaching Scotland and the Scottish Qualifications Authority.   </p>
<p>

SSDN Content Delivery Infrastructure (CDI): A country-wide intelligent content delivery network which will facilitate the flow of media-rich learning resources across the country - when and where you want them. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../746/51746.xml">
Cisco</link></company>
 described it as "the biggest content delivery network of its kind in the world."</p>
<p>

SSDN National Intranet: Tools for teaching and learning, sharing and collaborating all within a safe, secure, online environment.</p>
<p>

The national intranet will offer:
- Secure and personalised access
- Virtual learning, including virtual whiteboards to share information across many schools taking part in one lesson; the system includes tools access and the ability to manipulate and present content 
- Collaborate, cooperate and communicate across the network
- Technical, helpdesk and training support                      </p>
<p>

The full service will be entirely web-delivered and browser-based, enabling access from school, home or anywhere that internet access is possible.</p>
<p>

The funding is from the Scottish Executive and is a collaboration between local authorities, Learning and Teaching Scotland and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/340852.xml">
RM</link>.</p>
<p>

Initial piloting began in March 2006, and roll out will begin in September 2006, with full functionality available from May 2007 (core portal, authentication system, national user directory, virtual teaching and learning environment, collaborative environment, helpdesk). </p>
