<b>Mutual assured destruction</b> (<b>MAD</b>; sometimes written as <b>mutually assured destruction</b>) is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/18935258.xml">

Theory</st>
<p>

The doctrine assumes that each side has enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the other side and that either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate escalation resulting in both combatants' total and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/45873.xml">
assured destruction</link>. It is now generally assumed that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../683/53683.xml">
nuclear fallout</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../171/22171.xml">
nuclear winter</link> resulting from a large scale nuclear war would bring about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/1113286.xml">
worldwide devastation</link>, though this was not a critical assumption to the theory of MAD.</p>
<p>

The doctrine further assumes that neither side will dare to launch a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../876/45876.xml">
first strike</link> because the other side will <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/3726789.xml">
launch on warning</link> (also called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/158262.xml">
fail-deadly</link>) or with secondary forces (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/2078286.xml">
second strike</link>) resulting in the destruction of both parties. The payoff of this doctrine is expected to be a tense but stable peace.</p>
<p>

The primary application of this doctrine started during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/325329.xml">
Cold War</link> (1950s to 1990s) in which MAD was seen as helping to prevent any direct full-scale conflicts between the <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

 while they engaged in smaller <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/578611.xml">

arms race</link>, as both nations struggled to keep nuclear parity, or at least retain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/2078286.xml">
second-strike capability</link>. Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction certainly continues to be in force although it has receded from public discourse.</p>
<p>

Proponents of MAD as part of U.S. and USSR strategic doctrine believed that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../880/36880.xml">
nuclear war</link> could best be prevented if neither side could expect to survive a full scale nuclear exchange (as a functioning state).  Since the credibility of the threat is critical to such assurance, each side had to invest substantial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/181293.xml">
capital</link> in their nuclear arsenals even if they were not intended for use. In addition, neither side could be expected or allowed to adequately defend itself against the other's nuclear missiles.  This led both to the hardening and diversification of nuclear delivery systems (such as nuclear <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/435114.xml">

 detonated its own nuclear weapon.  At the time, both sides lacked the means to effectively use nuclear devices against each other.  However, with the development of aircraft like the <aircraft wordnetid="102686568" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Europe</link>, regardless of whether it was a conventional or a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>

During the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../827/6827.xml">
Cuban Missile Crisis</link>, the Soviet Union truly developed an understanding of the effectiveness of the U.S. ballistic missile submarine forces, and work on Soviet ballistic missile submarines began in earnest. For the remainder of the Cold War, although official positions on MAD changed in the United States, the consequences of the second strike from ballistic missile submarines was never in doubt.</p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../145/53145.xml">
multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle</link> (MIRV) was another weapons system designed specifically to aid with the MAD nuclear deterrence doctrine. With a MIRV payload, one <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../939/14939.xml">
ICBM</link> could hold many separate warheads. MIRVs were first created by the United States in order to counterbalance Soviet anti-ballistic missile systems around Moscow. Since each defensive missile could only be counted on to destroy one offensive missile, making each offensive missile have, for example, three warheads (as with early MIRV systems) meant that three times as many defensive missiles were needed for each offensive missile.  This made defending against missile attacks more costly and difficult. One of the largest U.S. MIRVed missiles, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/201975.xml">
LGM-118A Peacekeeper</link>, could hold up to 10 warheads, each with a yield of around 300 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/30318.xml">
kiloton</link>s—all together, an explosive payload equivalent to 230 <weapon wordnetid="104565375" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/18597.xml">

 bombs. The multiple warheads made defense untenable with the technology available, leaving only the threat of retaliatory attack as a viable defensive option. MIRVed land-based ICBMs are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. It is because of this that this type of weapon was banned under the <statement wordnetid="106722453" confidence="0.8">

The Soviet Union countered this threat by issuing a statement that any use of nuclear weapons against Soviet forces, tactical or otherwise, was grounds for a full-scale Soviet retaliatory strike. As such, it was generally assumed that any combat in Europe would end with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/58970.xml">

 in 1959, that a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../764/41764.xml">
survivable</link> nuclear force became possible and second strike capability credible.  This was not fully understood until the 1960s when the strategy of mutually assured destruction was first fully described, largely by United States Secretary of Defense <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<officeholder wordnetid="110371450" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. </p>
<p>

In McNamara's formulation, MAD meant that nuclear nations either had first strike or second strike capability. A nation with first strike capability would be able to destroy the entire nuclear arsenal of another nation and thus prevent any nuclear retaliation. Second strike capability indicated that a nation could uphold a promise to respond to a nuclear attack with enough force to make such a first attack highly undesirable. According to McNamara, the arms race was in part an attempt to make sure that no nation gained first strike capability.</p>
<p>

An early form of second strike capability had already been provided by the use of continual patrols of nuclear-equipped bombers, with a fixed number of planes always in the air (and therefore untouchable by a first strike) at any given time. The use of this tactic was reduced however, by the high logistic difficulty of keeping enough planes active at all times, and the increasing priority given to ICBMs over bombers (which might be shot down by air defenses before reaching their targets).</p>
<p>

Ballistic missile submarines established a second strike capability through their stealth and by the number fielded by each Cold War adversary&mdash;it was highly unlikely that all of them could be targeted and preemptively destroyed (in contrast to, for example, a missile bunker with a fixed location that could be targeted during a first strike). Given their long range, high <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../764/41764.xml">
survivability</link> and ability to carry many medium- and long-range nuclear missiles, submarines were a credible means for retaliation even after a massive first strike.</p>

) because, were it ever operational and effective, it would have undermined the "assured destruction" required for MAD. If America had a guarantee against Soviet nuclear attacks, its critics argued, it would have first strike capability which would have been a politically and militarily destabilizing position. Critics further argued that it could trigger a new arms race, this time to develop countermeasures for SDI. Despite its promise of nuclear safety, SDI was described by many of its critics (including Soviet nuclear physicist and later peace activist <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

nuclear blackmail</link> by a state with limited nuclear capability and is not planned to alter the nuclear posture between Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>

While relations have improved and an intentional nuclear exchange is increasingly unlikely, the decay in Russian nuclear capability in the post Cold War era has had an effect on the continued viability of the MAD doctrine. An article by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press stated that the United States could carry out a nuclear first strike on Russia and would "have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and ICBM." This was attributed to reductions in Russian nuclear stockpiles and the increasing inefficiency and age of that which remains. Lieber and Press argued that the MAD era is coming to an end and that U.S. is on the cusp of global nuclear primacy.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

However, in a follow up article in the same publication, others criticized the analysis, including Peter Flory, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, who began by writing "The essay by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press contains so many errors, on a topic of such gravity, that a Department of Defense response is required to correct the record."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>  Regarding reductions in Russian stockpiles, another response stated that "a similarly one-sided examination of [reductions in] U.S. forces would have painted a similarly dire portrait".</p>
<p>

As usual, a situation in which the United States might actually be expected to carry out a "successful" attack is perceived as a disadvantage for both countries, since Russia might feel forced to attempt a similar action first.</p>

Whether MAD was the officially accepted doctrine of the United States military during the Cold War is largely a matter of interpretation. The term MAD was not coined by the military but was, however, based on the policy of "Assured Destruction" advocated by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara during the 1960s.

, for example, has retrospectively contended that it never advocated MAD and that this form of deterrence was seen as one of numerous options in U.S. nuclear policy. Former officers have emphasized that they never felt as limited by the logic of MAD (and were prepared to use nuclear weapons in smaller scale situations than "Assured Destruction" allowed), and did not deliberately target civilian cities (though they acknowledge that the result of a "purely military" attack would certainly devastate the cities as well). MAD was implied in several U.S. policies and used in the political rhetoric of leaders in both the U.S. and the USSR during many periods of the Cold War.
To continue to deter in an era of strategic nuclear equivalence, it is necessary to have nuclear (as well as conventional) forces such that in considering aggression against our interests any adversary would recognize that no plausible outcome would represent a victory or any plausible definition of victory. To this end and so as to preserve the possibility of bargaining effectively to terminate the war on acceptable terms that are as favorable as practical, if deterrence fails initially, we must be capable of fighting successfully so that the adversary would not achieve his war aims and would suffer costs that are unacceptable, or in any event greater than his gains, from having initiated an attack.</p>

Criticism and challengable assumptions</st>

<p>

Critics of the MAD doctrine note the similarity between the acronym and the common word for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/19356.xml">
mental illness</link>.  The doctrine of nuclear deterrence depends on several challengeable assumptions:</p>
<p>

<b>Second-strike capability</b>
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 A first strike must not be capable of preventing a retaliatory second strike or else mutual destruction is not assured. In this case, a state would have nothing to lose with a first strike; or might try to preempt the development of an opponent's second-strike capability with a first strike (ie. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/1054389.xml">
decapitation strike</link>).</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<b>Perfect detection</b>
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No false positives (errors) in the equipment and/or procedures that must identify a launch by the other side. The implication of this is that an accident could lead to a full nuclear exchange. During the Cold War there were several instances of false positives, as in the case of <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9638700866880419">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/14318910.xml">
Stanislav Petrov</link></person>
.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No possibility of camouflaging a launch. The use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../577/262577.xml">
stealth technology</link> in for instance aircraft such as the <work wordnetid="100575741" confidence="0.8">

</event>
</work>
 makes this assumption less likely to be fulfilled.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No means of delivery that does not have the characteristics of a long range missile delivery, i.e. detectable far ahead of detonation. Again this assumption is challengeable with for instance stealth aircraft but also with other means, such as smuggling weapons to the target undetected. A close range missile attack from a submarine would also negate this assumption, as would positioning the weapons close to the intended target (exemplified in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../827/6827.xml">
Cuban Missile Crisis</link>). </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Perfect attribution. If there is a launch from the Sino-Russian border, it could be difficult to distinguish which nation is responsible and, hence, against which nation retaliation should occur.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<b>Perfect rationality</b>
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../383/26383.xml">
rogue state</link>s" will develop nuclear weapons. Or, if they do, they will stop behaving as rogue states and subject themselves to the logic of MAD.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No rogue commanders will have the ability to corrupt the launch decision process.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 All leaders with launch capability care about the survival of their subjects.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No leader with launch capability would strike first and gamble that the opponent's response system would fail.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<b>Inability to defend</b>
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No shelters sufficient to protect population and/or industry.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 No development of anti-missile technology or deployment of remedial protective gear.</entry>
</list>

<b>Mutual</b>
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 There is evidence to suggest that the Soviets planned to fight nuclear and conventional wars simultaneously. If they did not regard a nuclear engagement as fatal, MAD would have been unable to deter them.</entry>
