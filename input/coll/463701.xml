In the sport of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/39806.xml">

batsman</link> who, with his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/465500.xml">

ball</link> from hitting the wicket. </p>
<p>

The origin of the word is from the standard definition of wicket as a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate.</p>

<b>Wicket</b> also refers to the event of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../145/418145.xml">
batsman</link> getting out. The batsman is said to have <it>lost his wicket</it> if dismissed by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../120/463120.xml">
bowler</link>, while the bowler is said to have <it>taken his wicket</it>. The number of wickets taken is the primary measure of a bowler's ability.</p>

 (with his hand or arm) and providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used. The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.</p>
<p>

If one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman. </p>

 have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/465500.xml">

<p>

The sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../921/1670921.xml">

Winning by number of wickets</st>
<p>

A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. A team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed, so, for example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets.</p>

 itself. According to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../210/463210.xml">
Laws of Cricket</link>, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it is quite possible that the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence. Much willow is employed in making wicker-work.</p>
<p>

The term <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/11521294.xml">
sticky wicket</link></it> refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been "to bat on a sticky wicket." Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test Match level) until the late 1950s.</p>
