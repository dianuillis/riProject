Accreditation</st>
<p>

Business schools or MBA programs may be accredited by external bodies which provide students and employers with an independent view of their quality, and indicate that the school's educational curriculum meets specific quality standards. The three major accrediting bodies are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../339/15637339.xml">
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</link> (AACSB) which accredits research universities, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../026/5944026.xml">

Basic types of MBA programs</st>
<p>

<b>Two year MBA</b> programs normally take place over two academic years (i.e. approximately 18 months of term time), in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in late August/September of year one and continuing until May of year two, with a three to four month summer break in between years one and two. Students enter with a reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience and take classes during weekdays like other university students.</p>
<p>

<b>Accelerated MBA</b> programs are a variation of the two year programs. They involve a higher course load with more intense class and examination schedules. They usually have less "down time" during the program and between semesters. For example, there is no three to four month summer break, and between semesters there might be seven to ten days off rather than three to five weeks vacation.</p>
<p>

<b>Part-time MBA</b> programs normally hold classes on weekday evenings, after normal working hours. Part-time programs normally last three years or more. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who take a light course load for a longer period of time until the graduation requirements are met.</p>
<p>

<b>Executive MBA (EMBA)</b> programs developed to meet the educational needs of managers and executives, allowing students to earn an MBA or another business-related graduate degree in two years or less while working full time. Participants come from every type and size of organization – profit, nonprofit, government — representing a variety of industries. EMBA students typically have a higher level of work experience, often 10 years or more, compared to other MBA students. In response to the increasing number of EMBA programs offered, The Executive MBA Council was formed in 1981 to advance executive education.</p>
<p>

<b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/8997.xml">
Distance learning</link></b> MBA programs hold classes off-campus. These programs can be offered in a number of different formats: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/8997.xml">
correspondence course</link>s by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/51138.xml">
postal mail</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../738/9738.xml">
email</link>, non-interactive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../604/113604.xml">
broadcast video</link>, pre-recorded video, live <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/41783.xml">
teleconference</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/274116.xml">
videoconference</link>, offline or online computer courses. Many respectable schools offer these programs; however, so do many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../132/551132.xml">
diploma mill</link>s. Potential students should check the school's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/621700.xml">
accreditation</link> before undertaking distance learning coursework.</p>
<p>

Dual MBA programs combine MBA degree with others (such as an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/236722.xml">
MS</link> or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../292/292292.xml">
J.D.</link>, etc) to let students cut costs (dual programs usually cost less than pursuing 2 degrees separately), save time on education and to tailor the business education courses to their needs. Some business schools offer programs in which students can earn both a bachelor's degree in business administration and an MBA in four or five years.</p>

 (GMAT), significant work experience, academic transcripts, essays, references or letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities and how the student can improve the diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole. All of these qualifications are important for admission; however, some schools do not weigh GMAT scores as heavily as other criteria. In order to achieve a diverse class, business schools also consider the target male-female ratio and local-international student ratios. </p>
<p>

Most schools are first concerned with whether or not the applicant can handle the quantity of course work. The <process wordnetid="105701363" confidence="0.8">
<inquiry wordnetid="105797597" confidence="0.8">

MBA programs expose students to a variety of subjects, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/9223.xml">
economics</link>, <link>
organizational behavior</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/59252.xml">

Many programs allow students to specialize or concentrate in a particular area. Standard concentrations include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/2593.xml">

In addition, a program may offer more specialized concentrations such as Asian business, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/13935230.xml">

Bologna Accord</st>
<p>

In Europe, the recent <link>
Bologna Accord</link> established uniformity in three levels of higher education: Bachelor (three years), Masters (two years in addition to three years for a Bachelor), and Doctorate (eight years). Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../126/335126.xml">
European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System</link>. A European masters degree in Management is therefore equivalent to the American MBA having additional scientific content; for example, a European MBA requires writing and defending a master's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../215/300215.xml">
thesis</link>.</p>

<st>
Accreditation</st>
<p>

Accreditation standards are not uniform in Europe. Some countries have legal requirements for accreditation (e.g. most German states), in some there is a legal requirement only for universities of a certain type (e.g. Austria), and others have no accreditation law at all. Even where there is no legal requirement, many business schools are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/621700.xml">
accredited</link> by independent bodies voluntarily to ensure quality standards.</p>

The MBA degree has become one of the most popular masters' degrees. As more universities started offering the degree, differences in the quality of schools, faculty, and course offerings became evident. Naturally, establishing some criteria of quality is needed to differentiate among MBA programs, especially for prospective students trying to decide on where to apply. As MBA programs proliferated, a variety of publications began providing information on them. Some of these consisted of compilations of information gathered from the universities offering the degree, usually published in book form. Eventually periodicals began publishing articles describing various MBA schools and ranking them according to some perceived quality criteria. One of the most prominent of these is <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../157/945157.xml">

Different methods of varying validity were used to arrive at rankings of MBA programs. The <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../956/3095956.xml">
Gourman Report</link></it>, for example, did not disclose criteria or ranking methods,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> and these reports were criticized for reporting statistically impossible data, such as no ties among schools, narrow gaps in scores with no variation in gap widths, and ranks of nonexistent departments.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> In 1977 <it>The Carter Report</it> published rankings of MBA programs based on the number of academic articles published by faculty. Periodicals based their rankings on interviews with company recruiters who hired MBA graduates, surveys of MBA schools' deans, polls of students or faculty, and a variety of other means. The defunct <it>MBA Magazine</it> asked deans to vote on the best programs. The methods of obtaining ranks often changed from year to year. Initially, rankings included only a small number of universities consisting of the largest and best known Ivy League and state schools. There are also many privately compiled rankings, including the Global Top 100 Business Schools compiled by the QS network.</p>

One study found that objectively ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can reasonably duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> The study concluded that a truly objective ranking would be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria, and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings still are not tailored to individual needs, and their value is diminished if they use an incomplete population of schools, fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.</p>
