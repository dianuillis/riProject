The <b>Parliamentary Information Management Services</b> (PIMS) is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../863/18934863.xml">
electronic library</link> used in the <parliament wordnetid="108319198" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../964/13964.xml">
Parliament of the United Kingdom</link></parliament>
.<p>

The aims of the PIMS project were to provide easy access to parliamentary information for all users of the parliamentary <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/37481.xml">
intranet</link>, by creating a new infrastructure for the storage, search, retrieval and management of parliamentary information held in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/17727.xml">
Libraries</link> of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/13828.xml">
Houses of Commons</link> and <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../658/13658.xml">
Lords</link></legislature>
. This would replace and extend the <link>
POLIS database</link>s that had been used by the two Libraries for over twenty years, and provide a platform on which the services available to Members of both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/24170.xml">
Houses of Parliament</link> and the public might be developed further.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

The first services went live in December 2004 supporting Commons Library enquiry handling. The main services came on stream in April 2005 with facilities for search and retrieval of material and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/223240.xml">
content management</link>. There were some initial difficulties with maintaining the currency of information in the system, and a programme of technical changes designed to improve performance was put in place and completed in November 2005. Further enhancements were made over the next few months before the project concluded in early 2006. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
