A <b>gatekeeper</b> is defined as someone who controls <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../682/40682.xml">
access</link> to something.  It also refers to individuals who decide whether a given message will be distributed by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/19641.xml">

Gatekeeping Roles</st>
<p>

Gatekeepers serve several different purposes such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../959/1524959.xml">
academic admissions</link>, financial advising, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../041/22041.xml">
news</link> editing.  Academic admissions plays a vital role in every student's life.  They look at qualifications such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/225971.xml">

Network television gatekeeping</st>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/29831.xml">
Television</link> gatekeeping has a variety of responsibilities such as the coordination of activities, control of money, management and personnel, and the application of authority.  A gatekeeper in this field decides what subject and when the subject airs on TV.  They also have control over what television programs actually air on their broadcast.</p>

Academic Peer Review</st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/24116.xml">
Peer Review</link> is a practice widely used by specialized journals that publish articles reporting new research, new discoveries, or new analyses in a specific academic field or area of focus.  Journal editors ask one or more subject matter experts deemed to be "peers" of an article's author or authors to assess an article's suitability for publication in the journal.  The intent of peer review is to determine that articles submitted for publication relate to the subject matter charter of the journal and comply with standards of format, tone, and style.</p>
<p>

Notwithstanding the fact that the intent of peer review is to insure suitability and editorial quality, issues of preference or exclusion of articles are raised from time to time relating to the intellectual prejudices, career rivalries, or other biases of the journal editors or peer reviewers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Credentialism</st>

<p>

Credentialing is the practice of evidencing suitability for engaging in a profession or for employability through documentation of demonstrated competency or experience, completion of education or training, or other criteria as specified by a credentialing authority. The documentation provided by the authority are known as "credentials", and may be in the form of a license, certificate of competency, a diploma, a teaching credential, a board certification, or a similar document.  <issue wordnetid="105814650" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../171/2386171.xml">
Credentialism</link></issue>
 refers to the practice of relying on credentials to prove the suitability of a professional person or a skilled employee to be assigned the responsibilities of professional engagement or employment.</p>
<p>

To the extent that employers may specify credentials that are more than needed for an employment position, or accede to the pressures of organizations that award credentials to require specific credentials, the inappropriate or unnecessary requirement for credentials may be a form of <b>gatekeeping</b>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

 and others can give the illusion that they are conducting broad, unencumbered searches for the information as specified by the user.  However, search engines can be instructed, openly or internally, to modify or redirect a searches, or to exclude qualifying items from the search results. The search engine serves as an instrument for a <b>gatekeeper</b>, who may be the search engine provider, an influential search engine customer, or a government.</p>

Gatekeeping risks</st>
<p>

Accountants, analysts, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/1194146.xml">
credit rating</link> agencies function as gatekeepers to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/41916.xml">
financial market</link>s by providing information on investment products to investors.  Accountants have been accused not only of being aware of accounting irregularities but even of aiding and abetting the violators.  <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, is suspected of putting higher emphasis on carrying out its more profitable consultancy work for the company than on confirming that the company's accounts were in order. The number of households investing in stock and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/226597.xml">
mutual fund</link>s increased over the past ten years. This means that more market participants depends on information provided by financial gatekeepers.  In response to these concerns, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../149/195149.xml">
U.S. Government</link> enacted the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/67031.xml">

chief executive officer</link>s of public companies to certify the reliability of their companies <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/93755.xml">
