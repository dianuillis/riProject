The <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.cchit.org">
<b>Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology</b> (CCHIT)</weblink> is a private not-for-profit organization that serves as the recognized US certification authority for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/1129641.xml">
electronic health record</link>s (EHR) and their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../652/5652.xml">
networks</link>.  CCHIT was founded in 2004 with support from three leading industry associations in healthcare information management and technology: the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../715/13461715.xml">
American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA)</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/2204377.xml">
Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society</link> (<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.himss.org">
HIMSS</weblink>) and the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nahit.org">
National Alliance for Health Information Technology</weblink>(the Alliance). In September 2005, CCHIT was awarded a 3-year contract by the U.S. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/58250.xml">
Department of Health and Human Services</link> (HHS) to develop and evaluate the certification criteria and inspection process for EHRs and the networks through which they interoperate. In October 2006, HHS officially designated CCHIT as a Recognized Certification Body (RCB).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>
