. The college, established in 1971, was formerly known as <b>Outwood Grange School</b> prior to changing its identity in 2002. The current headteacher is Michael Wilkins.</p>
<p>

In 2003 the school was achieving a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/151712.xml">
GCSE</link> pass rate with around 46%<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> of pupils achieving five A to C grades. By 2005 that result had risen to 83%,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> an increase underpinned by the quality of an updated curriculum and new intervention schemes used to aid underperforming students.</p>

Recent developments</st>
<p>

Outwood Grange College achieved <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/1863513.xml">
specialist</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../577/7393577.xml">
technology college</link> status in 2002. Since then it has seen major redevelopment work improving college grounds, buildings and the facilities in general. This included major renovation works to the majority of the Upper College Block, where new ICT suites, a recording studio and improved reception facilities were created. The Lower College Hall also received attention and was equipped with retractable seating and top of the range conferencing equipment.</p>
<p>

In 2005 a gravel playing field, commonly known as "redgra" after its composition of red gravel, was replaced with an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../480/66480.xml">
astroturf</link> sports field after many years of fundraising. In the same year a new Business and Training Centre was opened, housing both the Business Department and additional training facilities for rental purposes. The college has used these advanced facilities to aid other schools in the region, and to participate in the launch of national initiatives such as "<link>
Make Your Mark Start Talking Ideas</link>", which encourages youngsters to engage themselves with business.</p>
<p>

The school has recently made significant changes to its Senior Leadership Team. Michael Wilkins has become the Executive Principal overseeing Outwood and another school in Harrogate. Julie Slater has become the College Principal at Outwood Grange.</p>

Tracking student progress</st>
<p>

The college uses a series of effort grades known as "Praising Stars." The system uses grades prefixed with the letter "E", standing for "Effort", which range from E1 (Brilliant) to E3 (Reasonable) to E6 (Exclusion).</p>
<p>

Praising Stars, or 'E Grades' as they are commonly called, are given to students at the end of each half-term as a form of report to parents. It is commonplace for individual year groups to have assemblies which recognize and commend students that have performed well throughout the term achieving E1s and E2s.</p>
<p>

In many cases individual teachers also use Praising Stars as a way of marking pieces of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../468/1919468.xml">
classwork</link>. </p>

<st>
Disciplinary measures</st>
<p>

The school uses a system of escalating "consequences" as a framework for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../350/455350.xml">
discipline</link>, beginning with C1 and ranging through to C6 (<group_action wordnetid="101080366" confidence="0.8">
<punishment wordnetid="101160342" confidence="0.8">
<event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">
<social_control wordnetid="101123598" confidence="0.8">
<act wordnetid="100030358" confidence="0.8">
<psychological_feature wordnetid="100023100" confidence="0.8">

exclusion</link></psychological_feature>
</act>
</social_control>
</event>
</punishment>
</group_action>
).</p>
<p>

Upon reaching C4, a student is removed from the classroom and given a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../292/6241292.xml">
detention</link>, during which they are provided a list of the expectations for behaviour in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/1214654.xml">
classroom</link>. If, however, the student then choses to not attend the detention they are given a C5, which results in isolation for 1 school day. A C6 is given if the situation escalates further, resulting in a fixed time of exclusion from school.</p>

Pastoral care</st>
<p>

In early 2007 the college revealed plans to restructure how <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/8013831.xml">
tutor group</link>s, the main provision of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../830/6616830.xml">
pastoral care</link> within the college, are organised, moving from the traditional horizontal structure to a more progressive vertical one. Although controversial, the plan progressed through consultation and has been put into place from September 2008 (Currently excluding Year 13's).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The former structure saw each pupil belonging to a <fundamental_quantity wordnetid="113575869" confidence="0.8">
<time_period wordnetid="115113229" confidence="0.8">
<year wordnetid="115203791" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/5890561.xml">

</year>
</time_period>
</fundamental_quantity>
 of around 30 pupils from their own year-group, which they remain in, together with a teacher acting as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../965/299965.xml">
tutor</link>, for their entire school career. The new structure keeps a consistent teacher acting as a tutor to the group, but is mixed-age with pupils from all year groups being included in each mentoring group. This means that each group evolves every year, as older pupils leave and are replaced by younger pupils entering the college. Pupils entering the college are guaranteed, as in the past, to have at least one friend in their mentoring group.</p>
<p>

Vertical structuring has been implemented in other secondary schools, the main advantages being seen as the mixing of ages leading to an increased sense of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/5695.xml">
community</link>, allowing for pupils to share experiences, foster understanding and reduce <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../852/15325852.xml">
bullying</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
