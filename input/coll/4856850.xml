Reservations are intended to increase the social diversity in campuses and workplaces by lowering the entry criteria for certain identifiable groups that are grossly under-represented in proportion to their numbers in the general population. Caste is the most used criteria to identify under-represented groups. However there are other identifiable criteria for under-representation -- gender (women are under represented), state of domicile (North Eastern States, as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are under-represented), rural people, etc. -- as revealed by the Government of India sponsored National Family Health and National Sample surveys.</p>
<p>

The underlying theory is that the under-representation of the identifiable groups is a legacy of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/7347540.xml">
Indian caste system</link>. After India gained independence, the <document wordnetid="106470073" confidence="0.8">

<writing wordnetid="106362953" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/315776.xml">

</written_communication>
</document>
 listed some erstwhile groups as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../433/1564433.xml">
Scheduled Castes</link> (SC) and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../433/1564433.xml">
Scheduled Tribes</link> (ST). The framers of the Constitution believed that, due to the caste system, SCs and the STs were historically oppressed and denied respect and equal opportunity in Indian society and were thus under-represented in nation-building activities. The Constitution laid down 15% and 7.5% of vacancies to government aided educational institutes and for jobs in the government/public sector, as reserved quota for the SC and ST candidates respectively for a period of five years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. This period was routinely extended by the following governments and the Indian Parliament, and no revisions were undertaken for the fear of losing votes (It is a well known fact that the so-called backward communities are active in politics and their people vote; unfortunately, the majority of highly educated Indians do not vote during the general elections).</p>
<p>

Later, reservations were introduced for other sections as well. The Supreme Court ruling that reservations cannot exceed 50% (which it judged would violate equal access guaranteed by the Constitution) has put a cap on reservations.  However, there are state laws that exceed this 50% limit and these are under litigation in the Supreme Court. For example, the caste-based reservation fraction stands at 69% and is applicable to about 87% of the population in the state of Tamil Nadu (see section on Tamil Nadu below).</p>

India is  divided into many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../178/4178178.xml">
endogamous group</link>s, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/7257.xml">
castes</link> and sub-castes, as a result of centuries of practicing a form of social hierarchy called the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/7347540.xml">
caste system</link>. Proponents of reservation policy says that the traditional caste system, as it is practised, leads to severe <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../470/648470.xml">
oppression</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../410/1009410.xml">

The Court has categorically reiterated its prior stand that "Creamy Layer" should be excluded from the ambit of reservation policy. The Supreme Court avoided answering the question whether reservations can be made in private institutions, stating that the question will be decided only as and when a law is made making reservations in private institutions.

Several criteria to identify creamy layer has been recommended, which are as follows:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

Those with family income above Rs&nbsp;250,000 a year should be in creamy layer, and excluded from the reservation quota. Also, children of doctors, engineers, chartered accountants, actors, consultants, media professionals, writers, bureaucrats, defence officers of colonel and equivalent rank or higher, high court and Supreme Court judges, all central and state government Class A and B officials. The court has requested Parliament to exclude MPs’ and MLAs’ children, too.</p>

Indian Judiciary has pronounced some Judgments upholding reservations and some judgments for fine tuning its implementations.

1.The Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2005 does 
not violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution so far as it 
relates to the state maintained institutions and aided educational 
institutions.  Question whether the Constitution (Ninety-Third

as "private unaided" educational institutions are concerned, is left

6. The Central Government shall examine as to the desirability of fixing a cut off marks in 
respect of the candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs)to balance reservation with other societal interests and to maintain standards of excellence. This would ensure quality and merit would not suffer. If any seats remain  vacant after adopting such norms they shall be filled up by candidates from  general categories. 
7. So far as determination of backward classes is concerned, a Notification should be issued 
by the Union of India. This can be done only after exclusion of the creamy layer for which 
necessary data must be obtained by the Central Government from the State Governments and Union Territories.  Such  Notification is open to challenge on the ground of wrongful exclusion or inclusion. Norms must be fixed keeping in view the peculiar features in different States and 
Union Territories.  There has to be proper identification of Other Backward Classes (OBCs.).  For identifying backward classes, the Commission set up pursuant to the directions of this Court in Indra Sawhney 1 has to work more effectively and not merely decide applications for inclusion or exclusion of castes.
8.The Parliament should fix a deadline by which time free and compulsory education will have 
reached every child.  This must be done within six months, as the right to free and compulsory 
education is perhaps the most important of all the fundamental rights (Art.21 A).  For without education, it becomes extremely difficult to exercise other fundamental rights. 
9.If material is shown to the Central Government that the Institution deserves to be included in the Schedule (institutes which are excluded from reservations) of The Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 (No. 5 of 2007), the Central Government must take an appropriate decision on the basis of materials placed and on examining the concerned issues as to whether Institution deserves to be included in the Schedule of the said act as provided in Sec 4 of the said act.
10. Held that the determination of SEBCs is done not solely based on caste and hence, the identification of SEBCs is not violative of Article 15(1) of the Constitution.</col>

Types of Reservation</st>
<p>

Seats in educational institutions and jobs are reserved based on a variety of criteria. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../268/1714268.xml">
quota system</link> sets aside a proportion of all possible positions for members of a specific group. Those not belonging to the designated communities can compete only for the remaining positions, while members of the designated communities can compete for all positions (reserved and open). For example, when 2 out of 10 clerical positions in railways are reserved for ex-servicemen, those who have served in the Army can compete both in the General Category as well as in the specific quota. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
Caste based</st>
<p>

Seats are reserved for Schedules Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Castes (based chiefly on caste at birth) in varying ratio by the central government and state government. This caste is decided based on birth, and can never be changed. While a person can change his religion, and his economic status can fluctuate, the caste is permanent. In  central government funded higher education institutions, 22.5% of available seats are reserved for Scheduled Caste (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../879/18291879.xml">
Dalit</link>) and Scheduled Tribe (<social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

This ratio is followed even in Parliament and all elections where few constituencies are earmarked for those from certain communities. In a few states like Tamil Nadu, the percentage of reservation is 18% for SCs and 1% for STs, being based on local demographics. In <legal_power wordnetid="105198427" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Relaxations</st>
<p>

In view of the fact that several of the top undergraduate and graduate institutions in India, such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../055/231055.xml">
IIT</link>s, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../493/441493.xml">
IIM</link>s  are among the most selective in the world, it is not surprising that most reservation criteria are applied at the stage of entrance examinations for these institutions. Some of the criteria are relaxed for reserved categories, while others are completely eliminated. Examples include:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 The minimum high school marks criteria are relaxed for reserved seats. For example in IIT JEE reserved category candidates scoring about 65% of the last admitted general category candidate are directly offered admission. Candidates not meeting this cutoff but scoring as low as half of this are offered admission to a one year preparatory course. In AIIMS, for example SC/ST students are eligible only if they score 50%. But this 50% is not mandatory for the institute quota and in occasion the Honourable High Court of Delhi had found that "AIIMS students, who had secured as low as 14% or 19% or 22% in the (all-India) entrance examination got admission to PG courses<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></entry>

Reservation policy in Tamil Nadu</st>

<st>
Historical perspective</st>
<p>

The reservation system in <city wordnetid="108524735" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/29918.xml">
Tamil Nadu</link></city>
 is much in contrast to the rest of India, not by the nature of reservation but by its history.When the first reservation protest hit New Delhi in May 2006, a contrasting quiet serenity was noticed in Chennai. Later, as the anti-reservation lobby gained in visibility in Delhi, Chennai saw quite street protests demanding reservation. Doctors in Chennai, including Indian Medical Association members, were in the forefront expressing their support for reservation in institutions of higher education run by the Central government.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Present practise</st>
<p>

At present, in day to day practise, there is an approximately 51.14% reservation. The intended 69% reservation has been challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of an earlier supreme court ruling limiting reservations to 50%. While the case is pending, admissions are supposed to be based on "69% reservation", but those candidates who are denied admission because of the reservation exceeding 50% are reserved 'newly created extra seats'. This has led to a defacto reservation exclusively for the benefit of a section of the forward caste students (FCs between 50th and 69th percentiles) since the remaining bc/ mbc/sc/st category candidates gain nothing by being bracketted under open competition category since they are entitled to seats even before the (partial?) correction for sake of supreme court limit of 50 % is done. This unique exercise practised in Tamilnadu has effectively reduced the reservation% to exactly 51.114% (52.28/ 102.28 i.e., 2.28% 'newly created extra seats' to accommodate those "affected" by 69% reservation is calculated based on extrapolating the 12% [Source: see govt. table or govt. map below / use http://mospi.nic.in/mospi_nsso_rept_pubn.htm] FC census map(see below)  to the 19% of all candidates between 50th and 69th percentile. The EXTRA 2.28% seats created are factored into the following calculations rather than a blind addition of 50 + 2.28 since 52.28/ 102.28 = 51.114%.</p>
<p>

The effective reservation % in practise is calculated by using a simple formula:
"Effective reservation%"= govt. stated category % (reserved % before oc candidates were admitted to pacify forward castes who were affected by the 69% rule) divided by govt stated total %  and multiply this ratio to the effective total reservation % 
i.e.,actual reservation = 51.114/69 x (intended reservation % by Tamilnadu) 
Simply, due to an indirect practise of reservation for forward castes, the actual reservation status in Tamilnadu is AS FOLLOWS</p>
<p>

Approx 1.7 % 'defacto reservation' for FCs between 50 th &amp; 69 th percentile (0% intended),</p>
<p>

for OBCs the actual reservation is approximately  22  1/4 % of seats(30% intended),</p>
<p>

for MBCs the actual reservation is approximately   15     % of seats(20% intended),</p>
<p>

for SCs the actual reservation is approximately   13  1/3 % of seats(18% intended) </p>
<p>

&amp; for STs the actual reservation is approximately     3/4 % of seats(1% intended). </p>
<p>

This corrected implementation is being followed in all non minority institutions in tamilnadu. If the above correction is not taken into account, an illusion is created by which it wrongly appears as if all other communities gained seats more than their population at the expense of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/7502318.xml">
Forward Castes</link> in total number of seats. But in reality the courts have knowingly/ unknowingly reserved approximately 2.28% of seats for everyone (rich/ poor) in the forward castes who belongs in between the 50th &amp; 69th percentile when the govt. policy and the constitutional principle is to not reserve seats for any forward caste.</p>

After 1931,caste data is not collected for non SC/ST caste-groups in census. Mandal commission estimated OBC population based on 1931 census as 52%.There is an ongoing controversy about the estimation logic used by Mandal commission for calculating OBC population. Famous psephologist and researcher, Dr. Yogendra Yadav of the CSDS [who is a known votary of Affirmative Action] agrees that there is no empirical basis to the Mandal figure.

</list>

Counter Point: Affirmative Action programmes in these countries, especially in the USA, differ significantly from the caste-based reservation system in place in India. Affirmative Action in the USA recognizes that there are multiple factors of exclusion and discrimination working in society (such as race, gender, economic factors etc) while caste-based reservations focus only on caste at the cost of addressing social justice concerns more effectively for the sake of narrow political ends. </p>

 Affirmative Action has helped many - if not everyone from under-privileged and/or under-represented communities to grow and occupy top positions in the world's leading industries. (See the Section on Tamil Nadu) Reservation in education is not THE solution, it is just one of the many solutions. Reservations is a means to increase representation of hitherto under-represented caste groups and thereby improve diversity on campus. </entry>
</list>

Counter Point: Reservation only on the basis of caste tends to only perpetuate caste in society rather than eliminate it as a factor of social consideration, as envisaged by the Indian Constitution. It also weakens the notion of democratic citizenship by evaluating a person not on the basis of his/her merits or achievements or personal characteristics, but rather on the basis of accidents of birth.</p>

 To provide social justice to the most marginalized and underprivileged is our duty and their human right. Reservation will really help these marginalized people to lead successful lives, thus eliminating caste-based discrimination which is still widely prevalent in India especially in the rural areas.

Counter Point: Villages consist not only of the so called "lower classes" but also of the "upper castes"(30% rural population comprises upper castes according to national surveys<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://mospi.nic.in/rept%20_%20pubn/ftest.asp?rept_id=469&amp;type=NSSO">

To actually weaken the caste system, the government should provide incentives like reservations to people who marry outside their caste, thereby weakening the hold of the caste system in Indian Society.

 Reservation is everywhere in India - The head of a big firm is always the son of the company's chair, irrespective of the fact that there is another meritious person. The post of Temple priest in some temples is reserved only for a man from the Brahmin Caste, even if there is another person who knows the mantras. There exists practices of having separate temples with Gods like Ayyanar, Mariammal etc, which are situated outside the village and the priests in these temples are not Brahmins.

 There is great confusion in the "pro-reservation camp".

 It has been suggested that although caste is an important factor of exclusion at work in Indian society; other factors such as gender, economic conditions, geographical disparities and kind of schooling received cannot be altogether ignored. For example, a kid studying in a village or municipal school does not enjoy the same status in society as another who has studied in an elite public school, caste notwithstanding. Some academics have argued that a better system of Affirmative Action would be one which seeks to address all the factors of exclusion at work in society which restrict a person's competitive abilities. Notable contributions in this regard have been made by Professor Purushottam Agrawal of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in the form of the Multiple Index Related Affirmative Action [MIRAA] system  (see here: http://www.sabrang.com/cc/archive/2006/june06/report3.html) and by Dr. Yogendra Yadav and Dr. Satish Deshpande of the Centre for the Study Developing Societies [CSDS]. </entry>
