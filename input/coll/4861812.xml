Natan produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/14084.xml">

Natan himself was bisexual,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> and engaged in intercourse on screen in a number of films, notably <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/14963981.xml">
Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly</link></it> (1920) and <it>La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux</it> (1924). Natan is also known for having introduced <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../549/19549.xml">

Mainstream film career</st>
<p>

Over time, Bernard Natan moved out of pornographic film and into mainstream cinema. He worked as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/245583.xml">
publicity</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/511114.xml">
stringer</link> for <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../918/22918.xml">
Paramount Pictures</link></company>
 during the early 1920s. But by 1929, Natan's Rapid Film had become a major film producer and distributor. His reputation was such that in 1924 Natan became a member of the executive committee of the Cinematographic Employers' Federation. By 1926, his film laboratory was highly regarded, he had established a marketing firm, and he built two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../410/660410.xml">
sound stage</link>s. Natan was also a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../405/211405.xml">
film producer</link>, helping finance and produce motion pictures at other studios.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

<st>
Takeover of Pathé</st>
<p>

In late February 1929, Bernard Natan acquired the production and exhibition businesses of Pathé, then the largest French motion picture company. He agreed to merge his own studio, Rapid Film (then worth 25 million <currency wordnetid="113385913" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../835/444835.xml">
francs</link></currency>
), with Pathé in exchange for 50 million francs in shares. The remaining shares were purchased with funding from a consortium of banks, bonds (to be paid with income from Pathé), and a 10 percent ownership in Pathé by the banks. After the merger, Natan renamed the company Pathé-Natan (sometimes also credited as Pathé-Cinéma).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Natan took control. Studio founder <link>
Charles Pathé</link> had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and "rooster" trademark to other companies in return for a mere 2 percent of revenues generated by them. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the <condition wordnetid="113920835" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. Natan acquired another film studio, Sociètè des Cinéromans, from <link>
Arthur Bernède</link> and <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

, which enabled Pathé to expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theaters and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../078/1078.xml">
antisemitic</link> and contained veiled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../395/5097395.xml">

<p>

Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million <currency wordnetid="113385913" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../835/444835.xml">

 in profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel <link>
Pathé News</link>, which had not been produced since 1927.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathe's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/70318.xml">
sound film</link>. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, <it>Pathé-Revue</it> and <it>Actualités Féminines</it>, to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of <link>
Henri Chrétien</link>, who developed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/10515524.xml">
anamorphic lens</link> (a technology which later led to the creation of <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/29831.xml">
television</link> company, Télévision-<person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

But in 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring it.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

The collapse of Pathé led French authorities to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../559/14559.xml">
indict</link> Bernard Natan on charges of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/58790.xml">
fraud</link>. Natan was accused of financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../633/846633.xml">
shell corporation</link>s, and negligent financial mismanagement. Natan was even accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. Natan was indicted and imprisoned in 1939. A second indictment was brought in 1941, and he was convicted shortly thereafter. He was freed in September 1942.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Importance to the film industry</st>
<p>

Bernard Natan's importance to the French film industry should not be underestimated. He pioneered the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../269/206269.xml">
vertical integration</link> of the French film industry, and adopted the "American model" of film-making and distribution. This model provides the underpinning of the French film industry even in the 21st century. Indeed, Pathé survived into the 1980s almost solely on revenues generated by the companies purchased and integration instituted by Bernard Natan.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

Natan also brought television to France, and established the first French radio holding and television companies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Under Natan's leadership, the anamorphic film camera lens was developed. The anamorphic lens was not only a major advance in film technology, but helped <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../334/418334.xml">
Hollywood</link> survive during the early years of television.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

Natan also revolutionized pornographic film in France. He was one of the first, and certainly the most prominent, film-maker to include bisexuality and homosexuality in his films, and introduced masochism to French adult film as well.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
