The main part of the program is sometimes abbreviated OASDI (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) or RSDI (Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance).  When initially signed into law by President <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/10979.xml">
Franklin Roosevelt</link> in 1935, the term <it>Social Security</it> covered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../430/378430.xml">
unemployment insurance</link> as well. The term, in everyday speech, is used to refer only to the benefits for retirement, disability, survivorship, and death, which are the four main benefits provided by traditional private-sector pension plans. In 2004 the U.S. Social Security system paid out almost $500 billion in benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> By dollars paid, the U.S. Social Security program is the largest government program in the world and the single greatest expenditure in the federal budget, with 20.9% for social security and 20.4% for Medicare/Medicaid, compared to 20.1% for military expenditure. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Social Security is currently the largest social insurance program in the U.S., constituting 37% of government expenditure and 7% of GDP,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> and is currently estimated to keep roughly 40% all Americans age 65 or older, out of poverty.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>

Controversy</st>
<p>

Social Security was controversial when originally proposed, with one point of opposition being that it would cause a loss of jobs. However, proponents argued that there was in fact an advantage: it would encourage older workers to retire, thereby creating opportunities for younger people to find jobs, which would lower the unemployment rate. Historian Edward Berkowitz subsequently contended that the Act was a cause of the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../426/4623426.xml">
Roosevelt Recession</link>" in 1937 and 1938. However, the program has gone on to be one of the most popular government programs in American history.</p>
<p>

Most women and minorities were excluded from the benefits of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../430/378430.xml">

 but wished to avoid legislation which might interfere with the racial status quo in the South. The solution to this dilemma was to pass a bill that both included exclusions and granted authority to the states rather than the national government (such as the states' power in Aid to Dependent Children). Others have argued that exclusions of job categories such as agriculture were frequently left out of new social security systems worldwide because of the administrative difficulties in covering these workers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>

<p>

The inherent discrimination in the system can also be seen with regard to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/1282402.xml">
Aid to Dependent Children</link>. Since this money was allocated to the states to distribute, some localities assessed black families as needing less money than white families.

The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as concerns over changing gender roles and the position of minorities. Officials have responded more to the concerns of women than those of minority groups.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref> Social Security gradually moved toward universal coverage.

In 1940, benefits paid totaled $35 million. These rose to $961 million in 1950, $11.2 billion in 1960, $31.9 billion in 1970, $120.5 billion in 1980, and $247.8 billion in 1990 (all figures in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation).

1939 Amendments</st>
<p>

<b><it>Economic concerns</it></b>

 was blamed on the government, tied to the abrupt decrease in government spending and the $2 billion that had been collected in Social Security taxes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref> Benefits became available in 1940 instead of 1942 and changes to the benefit formula increased the amount of benefits available to all recipients in the early years of Social Security.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> These two policies combined to shrink the size of the reserves. The original Act had conceived of the program as paying benefits out of a large reserve. This Act shifted the conception of Social Security into the pay-as-you-go system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref> </p>
<p>

<b><it>Creation of the Social Security Trust Fund</it></b>
The amendments established a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/180777.xml">
trust fund</link> for any surplus funds. The managing trustee of this fund is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/43338.xml">
Secretary of the Treasury</link>. The money could be invested in both non-marketable and marketable <link>
securities</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref></p>
<p>

<b><it>The move toward family protection</it></b>
Calls for reform of Social Security emerged within a few years of the 1935 Act. Even as early as 1936, some believed that women were not getting enough support. Worried that a lack of assistance might push women back into the work force, these individuals wanted Social Security changes that would prevent this. In an effort to protect the family, therefore, some called for reform which tied women's aid more concretely to their dependency on their husbands.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref> Others expressed apprehension about the complicated administrative practices of Social Security.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref> Concerns about the size of the reserve fund of the retirement program, emphasized by a recession in 1937 led to further calls for change.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref></p>
<p>

These amendments, however, avoided the question of the large numbers of workers in excluded categories.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref> Instead, the amendments of 1939 made family protection a part of Social Security. This included increased federal funding for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/1282402.xml">
Aid to Dependent Children</link> and raised the maximum age of children eligible to receive money under the Aid to Dependent Children to 18. The amendment added wives, elderly widows, and dependent survivors of covered male workers to those who could receive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/43613.xml">
old age pensions</link>. These individuals had previously been granted lump sum payments upon only death or coverage through the Aid to Dependent Children program. If a married wage-earning woman’s own benefit was worth less than 50% of her husband’s benefit, she was treated as a wife, not a worker.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref> If a woman who was covered by Social Security died, however, her dependents were ineligible for her benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref> Since support for widows was dependent on the husband being a covered worker, African American widows were severely underrepresented and unaided by these changes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref> </p>
<p>

In order to assure fiscal conservatives who worried about the costs of adding family protection policies, the benefits for single workers were decreased and lump-sum death payments were abolished.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref></p>

Social Security payroll taxes are collected under authority of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../096/560096.xml">
Federal Insurance Contributions Act</link> (FICA). The payroll taxes are sometimes even called "FICA taxes."</p>
<p>

In the original 1935 law the benefit provisions were in Title II of the Act (which is why Social Security is sometimes referred to as the "Title II" program.) The taxing provisions were in a separate title, Title VIII. There is a deep reason for this, having to do with the constitutionality of the law (see discussion of the Constitutionality of the 1935 Act).</p>
<p>

As part of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII taxing provisions were taken out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue Code. Since it wouldn't make any sense to call this new section of the Internal Revenue Code "Title VIII," it was renamed the "Federal Insurance Contributions Act."</p>
<p>

The payroll taxes collected for Social Security are of course taxes, but they can also be described as contributions to the social insurance system that is Social Security. Hence the name "Federal Insurance Contributions Act." FICA refers to the tax provisions of the Social Security Act, as they appear in the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<st>
Amendments of the 1950s</st>
<p>

After years of debates about the inclusion of domestic labor, household employees working at least two days a week for the same person were added in 1950, along with nonprofit workers and the self-employed. Hotel workers, laundry workers, all agricultural workers, and state and local government employees were added in 1954.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2244%22])">44</ref> </p>
<p>

In 1956, the tax rate was raised to 4.0% (2.0% for the employer, 2.0% for the employee) and disability benefits were added. Also in 1956, women were allowed to retire at 62 with benefits reduced by 25%. Widows of covered workers were allowed to retire at 62 without the reduction in benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref></p>

Amendments of the 1960s</st>
<p>

In 1961, retirement at age 62 was extended to men, and the tax rate was increased to 6.0%.</p>
<p>

In 1962, the changing role of the female worker was acknowledged when benefits of covered women could be collected by dependent husbands, widowers, and children. These individuals, however, had to be able to prove their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../920/16784920.xml">

" program. Social Security was changed to withdraw funds from the independent "Trust Fund" and put it into the General Fund for additional congressional revenue.</p>
<p>

In 1965, the age at which widows could begin collecting benefits was reduced to 60. Widowers were not included in this change. When <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/40147.xml">
divorce</link>, rather than death, became the major cause of marriages ending, divorcées were added to the list of recipients. Divorcées over the age of 65 who had been married for at least 20 years, remained unmarried, and could demonstrate dependency on their ex-husbands received benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2247%22])">47</ref></p>
<p>

The government adopted a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/377146.xml">

<st>
Amendments of the 1970s</st>
<p>

<b><it>1972 Amendments</it></b>
In June 1972, both houses of the <legislature wordnetid="108163273" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/31756.xml">
United States Congress</link></legislature>
 approved by overwhelming majorities 20% increases in benefits for 27.8 million Americans. The average payment per month rose from $133 to $166. The bill also set up a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/522934.xml">
cost-of-living</link> adjustment (COLA) to take effect in 1975. This adjustment would be made on a yearly basis if the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../152/217152.xml">
Consumer Price Index</link> increased by 3% or more.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2249%22])">49</ref> This addition was an attempt to index benefits to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/38286.xml">
inflation</link> so that benefits would rise automatically. If inflation was 5%, the goal was to automatically increase benefits by 5% so their real value didn't decline. Unfortunately, however, there was a technical error in the formula that caused these adjustments to overcompensate for inflation, a technical mistake which has been called double-indexing. The COLAs actually caused benefits to increase at twice the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>

In October 1972, a $5 billion piece of Social Security legislation was enacted which expanded the Social Security program. For example, minimum monthly benefits of individuals employed in low income positions for at least 30 years were raised. Increases were also made to the pensions of 3.8 million widows and dependent widowers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2250%22])">50</ref> </p>
<p>

These amendments also established the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../822/143822.xml">
Supplemental Security Income</link> (SSI). Immigrants who had never paid into the system became eligible for SSI benefits when they reached age 65. SSI is not a Social Security benefit, but a welfare program, because the elderly and disabled poor are entitled to SSI regardless of work history. Likewise, SSI is not an entitlement, because there is no right to SSI payments.</p>
<p>

<b><it>Social concerns</it></b>
The impact of Social Security on women and minorities was analyzed during the early 1970s as both groups became increasingly vocal. Minorities noted that lower incomes and shorter life expectancies made their Social Security benefits insufficient. Women complained about the gender biases in Social Security. For example, many feminists argued that women continued to receive pensions through their relationships to male covered workers, a status which did not reflect the changing role of women in American culture.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2251%22])">51</ref> The 1975 Quadrennial Council on Social Security proposed many ideas to extend the coverage of Social Security. Yet concern over the economy and the financial outlook of Social Security dominated this time period.  </p>
<p>

<b><it>The 1970s and the negative financial outlook</it></b>
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, during the phase-in period of Social Security, Congress was able to grant generous benefit increases because the system had perpetual short-run surpluses.  Congressional amendments to Social Security took place in even numbered years (election years) because the bills were politically popular, but by the late 1970s, this era was over.  For the next three decades, projections of Social Security's finances would show large, long-term deficits, and in the early 1980s, the program flirted with immediate insolvency.  From this point on, amendments to Social Security would take place in odd numbered years (years that were not election years) because Social Security reform now meant tax increases and benefit reductions.  Social Security became known as the "Third Rail of American Politics."  Touching it meant political death.</p>
<p>

Several effects came together in the years following the 1972 amendments which rapidly changed the outlook on Social Security's long-term financial picture from positive to problematic.  By the 1970s, the phase-in period, during which workers were paying taxes but few were collecting benefits, was largely over, and the ratio of elderly population to the working population was increasing. These developments brought questions about the capacity of the long term financial structure based on a pay-as-you-go program.</p>

interest rates</link>, oil shortages, <link>
high unemployment</link> and slow <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/69415.xml">
economic growth</link>. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../899/424899.xml">
Productivity growth</link> in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1%, compared to 3.2% during the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../605/312605.xml">
deficit</link> which increased to $66 billion. The 1970s are described as a period of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../818/26818.xml">
stagflation</link>, meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely.</p>
<p>

These underlying negative trends were exacerbated by a colossal mathematical error made in the 1972 amendments establishing the COLAs. The mathematical error which overcompensated for inflation was particularly detrimental given the double-digit inflation of this period, and the error led to benefit increases that were nowhere near financially sustainable.</p>
<p>

The high inflation, double-indexing, and lower than expected wage growth was financial disaster for Social Security.</p>
<p>

<b><it>1977 Amendments</it></b>
To combat the declining financial outlook, in 1977 Congress passed and President Carter signed legislation fixing the double-indexing mistake. This amendment also altered the tax formulas to raise more money.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2252%22])">52</ref> With these changes, President Carter remarked, "Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030, the Social Security funds will be sound."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2253%22])">53</ref>  This turned out to be not the case.  The financial picture declined almost immediately and by the early 1980s, the system was again in crisis.</p>

<st>
Amendments of the 1980s</st>
<p>

After the 1977 amendments, the economic assumptions surrounding Social Security projections continued to be overly optimistic as the program moved toward a crisis. For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2254%22])">54</ref> In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2255%22])">55</ref> The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../947/161947.xml">

, was empaneled to investigate the long-run solvency of Social Security. The 1983 Amendments to the SSA were based on the NCSSR's Final Report."<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan.html">
Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform</weblink>".&#32;Retrieved on <link>
2008-03-15</link>. The NCSSR recommended enacting a six-month delay in the COLA and changing the tax-rate schedules for the years between 1984 and 1990.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2256%22])">56</ref> It also proposed an income tax on the Social Security benefits of higher-income individuals. This meant that benefits in excess of a household income threshold, generally $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for couples (the precise formula computes and compares three different measures) became taxable. These changes were important for generating revenue in the short term. </p>
<p>

Also of concern was the long-term prospect for Social Security because of demographic considerations. Of particular concern was the issue of what would happen when people born during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/8210419.xml">
post-World War II baby boom</link> retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2257%22])">57</ref> Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, signed into law by President <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, a previously-enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees were added to the system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half of the value of the Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2258%22])">58</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2259%22])">59</ref></p>
<p>

<b><it>The 1983 Amendments and the Social Security Trust Fund</it></b>
The 1983 Amendments also included a provision to exclude the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/180777.xml">
Social Security Trust Fund</link> from the unified budget (in political jargon, it was taken “off-budget”). This provision also provided for the exemption of Social Security and portions of the Medicare trust funds from any general budget cuts beginning in 1993.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2248%22])">48</ref> This change was one way of trying to protect Social Security funds for the future. </p>
<p>

As a result of these changes, particularly the tax increases, the Social Security system began to generate a large short-term surplus of funds, intended to cover the added retirement costs of the "baby boomers."  Congress invested these surpluses into special series, non-marketable U.S. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/469008.xml">
Treasury securities</link> held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Under the law, the government bonds held by Social Security are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Because the government had adopted the unified budget during the Johnson administration, this surplus offsets the total fiscal debt, making it look much smaller. There has been significant disagreement over whether the Social Security Trust Fund has been saved, or has been used to finance other government programs and other tax cuts.</p>

The largest component of OASDI is the payment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../495/26495.xml">
retirement</link> benefits.  Throughout a worker's career, the Social Security Administration keeps track of his or her earnings.  The amount of the monthly benefit to which the worker is entitled depends upon that earnings record and upon the age at which the retiree chooses to begin receiving benefits.  For the entire history of Social Security, benefits have been paid almost entirely by using revenue from payroll taxes.  This is why Social Security is referred to as a pay-as-you-go system.  In approximately a decade (2019), payroll tax revenue is projected to be insufficient to cover Social Security benefits and the system will begin to withdraw money from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/180777.xml">
Social Security Trust Fund</link>.  The existence and economic significance of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../777/180777.xml">
Social Security Trust Fund</link> is a subject of considerable dispute because its assets are special <link>
Treasury bond</link>s; i.e., the money in the trust fund have been loaned back to the federal government to pay for other expenses (hence it is said that the fund consists of nothing but "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../474/297474.xml">
IOU</link>s").</p>
<p>

The Supreme Court decided, in <it><case wordnetid="107308889" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/3370138.xml">
Flemming v. Nestor</link></case>
</it> (1960), that "entitlement to Social Security benefits is not a contractual right". In that case, Ephram Nestor, a Bulgarian immigrant to the United States who made contributions for covered wages for the statutorily required "quarters of coverage" was nonetheless denied benefits after being deported in 1956 for being a member of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/37008.xml">
Communist party</link>.  </p>
<p>

The case specifically held:</p>
<p>

<b>2.</b> A person covered by the Social Security Act has not such a right in old-age benefit payments as would make every defeasance of "accrued" interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 608-611.    <b>(a)</b>  The noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits are based on his contractual premium payments. Pp. 608-610.    <b>(b)</b>  To engraft upon the Social Security System a concept of "accrued property rights" would deprive it of the flexibility and [363 U.S. 603, 604]   boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions which it demands and which Congress probably had in mind when it expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Act. Pp. 610-611.    <b>3.</b>  Section 202 (n) of the Act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process. Pp. 611-612.    <b>4.</b>  Termination of appellee's benefits under 202 (n) does not amount to punishing him without a trial, in violation of Art. III, 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution or the Sixth Amendment; nor is 202 (n) a bill of attainder or ex post facto law, since its purpose is not punitive.

<st>
Primary Insurance Amount</st>
<p>

A worker's retirement income benefit is based on his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/14704147.xml">
Primary Insurance Amount</link>, or PIA.  The PIA is the average of the highest 35 years of the worker's covered earnings (before deduction for FICA). Covered earnings in any year are limited by that year's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/4994437.xml">
Social Security Wage Base</link>, the maximum earnings that could be subject to the OASDI portion of FICA payroll tax ($102,000 in 2008 <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2264%22])">64</ref>). If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, zeros are used to bring the total number of years of earnings up to 35. Years of covered work more than 2 years before the year the worker turns 62 are indexed upward to reflect the increase in the national wage via the average wage index (AWI) from the time at which the earnings were covered in the past to the value of the AWI two years before the worker turns 62 (which is the most recent year available at the date the worker turns 62). One-twelfth of this 35-year average is the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The PIA then is 90% of the AIME up to the first (low) bendpoint, and 32% of the excess of AIME over the first bendpoint but not in excess of the second (high) bendpoint, plus 15% of the AIME in excess of the second bendpoint.  Bendpoints designate the point at which the rates of return on a beneficiary's AIME change<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2265%22])">65</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2266%22])">66</ref>. In 2008, the bendpoints for calculating the PIA are a change from 90% to 32% at $711 and a change to 15% at $4,288.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2267%22])">67</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2266%22])">66</ref>  This PIA is then adjusted by automatic cost-of-living adjustments annually starting with the year the worker turns 62.   Similar computations based on career average earnings determine disability and survivor benefits.  These alternate computations average less years of earnings when the worker dies or is disabled before age 62 and use different base years for the inflation adjustments.</p>

Normal retirement age</st>

<indent level="1">

<it>Main article: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../766/14570766.xml">
Retirement Insurance Benefits</link></it>
</indent>
The earliest age at which (reduced) benefits are payable is 62. Full retirement benefits depend on a retiree's year of birth.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2268%22])">68</ref> Those born before 1938 have a normal retirement age of 65. Normal retirement age increases by two months for each ensuing year of birth until the 1943 year of birth, when it stays at age 66 years until the year of birth 1955. Thereafter the normal retirement age increases again by two months for each year ending in the 1960 year of birth, when normal retirement age stops at age 67 for all born thereafter.</p>
<p>

A worker who starts benefits before normal retirement age has their benefit reduced based on the number of months before normal retirement age they start benefits.  This reduction is 5/9 of 1% for each month up to 36 and then 5/12 of 1% for each additional month.  This formula gives an 80% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 65, a 75% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 66, and a 70% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 67. </p>
<p>

A worker who delays starting retirement benefits past normal retirement age earns delayed retirement credits that increase their benefit until they reach age 70. These credits are also applied to their widow(er)'s benefit.  Children and spouse benefits are not affected by these credits.</p>
<p>

The normal retirement age for widow(er) benefits shifts the year-of-birth schedule upward by two years, so that those widow(er)s born before 1940 have age 65 as their normal retirement age.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Spouse's benefit</st>
<p>

Any current spouse is eligible, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/40147.xml">
divorced</link> or former spouses are eligible generally if the marriage lasts for at least 10 years.  (State marriages of same sex couples are not recognized by OASDI for spousal benefits because the federal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/484002.xml">
DOMA</link> law excluded them for federal recognition for federal rights.±)  While it is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../118/3118.xml">
arithmetic</link>ally possible for one worker to generate spousal benefits for up to five of his/her spouses that he/she may have, each must be in succession after a proper divorce for each after a marriage of at least ten years. Because age 70 is the latest retirement age, and because no state recognizes marriage before teenage years, there are no more than 5 successive spousal benefits in ten-year intervals. This spousal <b>retirement benefit</b> is <b>half</b> the <b>PIA</b> of the worker; this is different from the spousal <b>survivor benefit</b>, which is the full PIA. The benefit is the product of the PIA, times one half, times the early-retirement factor if the spouse is younger than normal retirement age. There is no increase for starting spousal benefits <b>after</b> normal retirement age. This can occur if there is a married couple in which the younger person is the only worker and is more than 5 years younger. Only after the worker applies for retirement benefits may the non-working spouse apply for spousal retirement benefits. </p>
<p>

Note that, since the passage of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, in 2000, the spouse and children of a worker who has reached normal retirement age can receive benefits on the worker's record whether the worker is receiving benefits or not.  Thus a worker can delay retirement without affecting spousal and children's benefits.  <b>The worker may have to begin receipt of benefits, to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspend his/her own benefits in order to continue the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount. </b> </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Widow's benefits</st>
<p>

If a worker covered by Social Security dies, a surviving spouse can receive survivors' benefits. In some instances, survivors' benefits are available even to a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/40147.xml">
divorce</link>d spouse. A father or mother with minor or disabled children in his or her care can receive benefits which are not actuarially reduced. The earliest age for a nondisabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. The benefit is equal to the worker's full retirement benefit for spouses who are at, or older than, normal retirement age. If the surviving spouse starts benefits before normal retirement age, there is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../373/189373.xml">
actuarial</link> reduction.  If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their normal retirement age, the surviving spouse will have those credits applied to their benefit.  </p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Children's benefits</st>
<p>

Children of a retired, disabled or deceased worker may receive benefits as a "dependent" or "survivor" if they are under the age of 18, or between 18 and 19 and have not yet graduated from high school, or are over the age of 18 and were disabled before the age of 22.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2269%22])">69</ref></p>

A worker who has worked long enough and recently enough (based on "quarters of coverage" within the recent past) to be covered <b>can</b> receive disability benefits.  These benefits start after five full calendar months of disability, regardless of his or her age. The eligibility formula requires a certain number of credits (based on earnings) to have been earned overall, and a certain number within the ten years immediately preceding the disability, but with more-lenient provisions for younger workers who become disabled before having had a chance to compile a long earnings history.</p>
<p>

The worker must be unable to continue in his or her previous job and unable to adjust to other work, with age, education, and work experience taken into account; furthermore, the disability must be long-term, lasting 12 months, expected to last 12 months, resulting in death, or expected to result in death.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2270%22])">70</ref> As with the retirement benefit, the amount of the disability benefit payable depends on the worker's age and record of covered earnings.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../822/143822.xml">
Supplemental Security Income</link> (SSI) uses the same disability criteria as the insured social security disability program, but SSI is not based upon insurance coverage. Instead, a system of means-testing is used to determine whether the claimants' income and net worth fall below certain income and asset thresholds.</p>
<p>

Severely disabled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../987/128987.xml">
children</link> may qualify for SSI. Standards for child disability are different from those for adults. </p>
<p>

Disability determination at the Social Security Administration has created the largest system of administrative courts in the United States. Depending on the state of residence, a claimant whose initial application for benefits is denied can request <it>reconsideration</it> or a <it>hearing before an Administrative Law Judge</it>. Such hearings sometimes involve participation of a vocational expert (VE) or medical expert (ME), both independent, unbiased witnesses, as called upon by the ALJ.</p>
<p>

Reconsideration involves a re-examination of the evidence, and the opportunity for a hearing before a (non-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../902/168902.xml">
Attorney at law</link>) disability hearing officer. The hearing officer then issues a decision in writing, providing justification for his/her finding. If the claimant is denied at the reconsideration stage, (s)he may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. In some states, SSA has implemented a pilot program that eliminates the reconsideration step and allows claimants to appeal an initial denial directly to an Administrative Law Judge.</p>
<p>

Because the number of applications for Social Security is very large (approximately 650,000 applications per year), the number of hearings requested by claimants often exceeds the capacity of Administrative Law Judges. The number of hearings requested and availability of Administrative Law Judges varies geographically across the United States. In some areas of the country, it is possible for a claimant to have a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge within 90 days of his/her request. In other areas, waiting times of 18 months are not uncommon.</p>
<p>

After the hearing, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../178/1393178.xml">
Administrative Law Judge</link> (ALJ) issues a decision in writing. The decision can be <b>Fully Favorable</b> (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled as of the date that (s) he alleges in the application through the present), <b>Partially Favorable</b> (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled at some point, but not as of the date alleged in the application; OR the ALJ finds that the claimant <it>was</it> disabled but has improved), or <b>Unfavorable</b> (the ALJ finds that the claimant was not disabled at all). Claimants can appeal Partially Favorable and Unfavorable decisions to Social Security's Appeals Council, which is in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/32432.xml">
Virginia</link></country>
. The Appeals Council does not hold hearings; it accepts written briefs. Response time from the Appeals Council can range from 12 weeks to more than 3 years.</p>
<p>

If the claimant disagrees with the Appeals Council's decision, (s)he can appeal the case in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/70235.xml">
federal district court</link> for his/her jurisdiction. As in most federal court cases, an unfavorable district court decision can be appealed to the appropriate appellate circuit court, and an unfavorable appellate court decision can be appealed to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/31737.xml">
United States Supreme Court</link>.</p>

Estimated net Social Security benefits under differing circumstances</st>
<p>

<image location="left" width="375px" src="Fig._168_-_Single_men_with_different_wages_and_retirement_dates.JPG" type="thumb">
</image>

In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso created a Web-based Social Security benefits calculator.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2271%22])">71</ref> Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients.  In the book, <it>Democrats and Republicans - Rhetoric and Reality</it>, Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits of men and women who were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years.  These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in diffferent demographic groups.  For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker.  As income goes up, net benefits get smaller - even negative.  <image location="left" width="375px" src="Fig._165_-_Impact_of_gender_and_wage_levels_on_net_SS_benefits.JPG" type="thumb">
</image>
However, the impact is much greater for the future retiree (in 2045) than for the current retiree (2005). The male earning $95,000 per year and retiring in 2045 is estimated to lose over $200,000 by participating in the Social Security system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2272%22])">72</ref></p>
<p>

In the next graph (Figure 165) the depicted net benefits are averaged for people turning age 65 anytime during the years 2005 through 2045.  (In other words, the disparities shown are not related to retirement.)  However, we do see the impact of gender and wage level. Because women tend to live longer, they generally collect Social Security benefits for a longer time.  As a result, they get a higher net benefit, on average, no matter what the wage level.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2273%22])">73</ref></p>
<p>

<image location="left" width="375px" src="Fig._166_-_Net_lifetime_SS_benefits_of_married_men_and_women_where_only_one_person_works.JPG" type="thumb">
</image>
The next image (Figure 166) shows estimated net benefits for married men and women at different wage levels.  In this particular scenario it is assumed that the spouse has little or no earnings and, thus, will be entitled to collect a spousal retirement benefit.  According to Fried:</p>
<p>

"Two significant factors are evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that is higher than any column in Figure 165.  In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does the average single person - no matter what the gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses.  Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000.  In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2274%22])">74</ref></p>

<p>

The last graph shown (Figure 167) is a combination of Figures 165 and 166.  In this graph it is very clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 wage level a married person could be a big winner - getting net benefits of about $165,000.  On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single.  Altogether, there is a "swing" of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses).  Even more inequitable, perhaps, is the disparity between the high net benefits of the married person earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively low net benefits of the man or woman earning just $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender).  In other words, the high earner, in this scenario, gets a far greater return on his FICA tax investment than does the low earner.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2275%22])">75</ref></p>

</p>
<p>

In the book, <it>How Social Security Picks Your Pocket</it>, other factors affecting Social Security net benefits are identified:  Generally, people who work for more than 35 years get a lower net benefit - all other factors being equal.  People who don't live long after retirement age get a much lower net benefit.  (These people include men, the obese, and people with health problems related to environment or heredity.) Finally, people who derive a high percentage of income from non-wage sources get high Social Security net benefits because they appear to be "poor," when they are not. The progressive benefit formula for Social Security is blind to the income a worker may have from non-wage sources, such as spousal support, dividends and interest, or rental income.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2276%22])">76</ref></p>

Obtaining a Social Security number for a child who is not working is voluntary.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2277%22])">77</ref> Further, there is no general legal requirement that individuals join the Social Security program. Although the Social Security Act itself does not require a person to have a Social Security Number (SSN) to live and work in the United States.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2278%22])">78</ref>, the Internal Revenue Code does generally require the use of the social security number by individuals for federal tax purposes:</p>
<p>

<indent level="2">

The social security account number issued to an individual for purposes of section 205(c)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act shall, except as shall otherwise be specified under regulations of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], be used as the identifying number for such individual for purposes of this title.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2279%22])">79</ref>
</indent>

Importantly, most parents apply for Social Security numbers for their dependent children in order to <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2280%22])">80</ref> include them on their income tax returns as a dependent. Everyone filing a tax return, as taxpayer or spouse, must have a Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) since the IRS is unable to process returns or post payments for anyone without an SSN or TIN.</p>

The FICA taxes are imposed on all workers and self-employed persons.

Government bond</link>s, thus the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose deficit spending.  In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2282%22])">82</ref>  The Trust Fund is regarded by some as an accounting trick which holds no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government, which has an obligation to repay its debt.  It is important to note, however, that while the Treasury guarantees the interest and principal payments it makes to the Social Security Trust Fund, the benefit payments made from the Social Security Trust Fund to American retirees have no guarantee at all.</p>
<p>

The Social Security Administration's authority to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, <it>i.e.</it>, redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities.  Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends in part on the federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds.  The federal government's ability to repay Social Security, in turn, is contingent on fiscal policies taken today (which have tended to increase deficits and the percent of the budget spent on interest and principal payments) and in the future.</p>

Benefit payout comparisons</st>
<p>

The current formula used in calculating the benefit level (primary insurance amount or PIA) is very progressive so that sizable benefits could be obtained with much less than the forty to thirty five years of covered wages.  Workers who spend their entire careers in covered employment would be unfairly treated relative to workers who spend the first half of their careers not covered (as in municipal employment) by OASDI but are covered by an alternative plan.  These people who later switch into covered employment would be entitled to both the alternative non OASDI pension (presumably from a state or municipality) and get an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security.  The progressivity of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to <it>double dip</it>.  Therefore, there are two provisions that mitigate the effect of the double dipping: one for those who obtain OASDI benefits from a spouse who is a covered worker and the other for those who split their careers in covered and noncovered employment.  This latter double dip has a <it>claw back factor</it> which starts at maximum at 10 years and grades out to zero at 30 years so that there is no clawback for those with 30 years or more of covered wages.  This is to prevent those with abnormally low AIMEs due to few years of covered status from being treated as lifetime (say 44 years) career low wage earners with low AIMEs.</p>

International agreements</st>
<p>

In today's global environment people often relocate from one country to another, either permanently or on a limited time basis. This presents challenges to businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to ensure future benefits or having to deal with taxation authorities in multiple countries. To that end, the Social Security Administration has signed treaties, often referred to as <it>Totalization Agreements,</it> with other social insurance programs in various foreign countries.</p>
<p>

Overall, these agreements serve two main purposes. First, they eliminate dual Social Security taxation, the situation that occurs when a worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Second, the agreements help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.</p>
<p>

The following countries have signed totalization agreements with the SSA (and the date the agreement became effective):<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2285%22])">85</ref>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../861/564861.xml">

Demographic and revenue projections</st>
<p>

In each year since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, interest payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, most recently (in 2004) by more than $150 billion. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2288%22])">88</ref>  As the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/8210419.xml">
baby boomers</link>" move out of the work force and into retirement, however, it is anticipated that expenses will come to exceed Social Security tax revenues if there are no changes in current law concerning taxes, benefits, and the retirement age.  </p>
<p>

According to most projections, the Social Security trust fund will begin drawing on its Treasury Notes toward the end of the next decade (around 2018 or 2019), at which time the repayment of these notes will have to be financed from the general fund.  At some time thereafter, variously estimated as 2041 (by the  Social Security Administration<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2289%22])">89</ref>) or 2052 (by the  Congressional Budget Office<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2290%22])">90</ref>), the Social Security Trust Fund will have exhausted the claim on general revenues that had been built up during the years of surplus.  At that point, current Social Security tax receipts would be sufficient to fund 74 or 78% of the promised benefits, according to the two respective projections.   The Social Security Trustees suggest that either the payroll tax could increase to 16.41 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to 17.60 percent in 2081 or a cut in benefits by 25 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to an overall cut of 30 percent in 2081<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2291%22])">91</ref>.</p>
<p>

The Social Security Administration projects that the demographic situation will stabilize.  The cash flow deficit in the Social Security system will have leveled off as a share of the economy.  This projection has come into question.  Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse.  Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees.  In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

Tables published by the government's National Center for Health Statistics show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just six years in the next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/57070.xml">
Census Bureau</link></agency>
, shows more rapid growth.
</indent>

("Social Security Underestimates Future Life Spans, Critics Say"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2292%22])">92</ref>) The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050.  Other experts, however, think that the past gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and add that the adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements induce people to stay in the workforce longer.</p>
<p>

Actuarial science, of the kind used to project the future solvency of social security, is by nature inexact. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections that turned out to be too optimistic.  It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according actuary David Langer) assumptions which resulted in the projected exhaustion date being pushed back (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the '90s, the midline projections were too pessimistic.  Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.</p>
<p>

The Social Security Advisory Board has on three occasions since 1999 appointed a Technical Advisory Panel to review the methods and assumptions used in the annual projections for the Social Security trust funds.  The most recent report of the Technical Advisory Panel, released in June 2008 with a copyright date of October 2007, includes a number of recommendations for improving the Social Security projections.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2293%22])">93</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2294%22])">94</ref></p>

Increased spending for Social Security will occur at the same time as increases in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">
Medicare</link>, as a result of the aging of the baby boomers.  One projection illustrates the relationship between the two programs:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

From 2004 to 2030, the combined spending on Social Security and Medicare is expected to rise from 7% of national income (gross domestic product) to 13%. Two-thirds of the increase occurs in Medicare. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2295%22])">95</ref>

On July 22, 2008 the Social Security Administration introduced a new <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ssa.gov/estimator/">
online benefits estimator</weblink>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2296%22])">96</ref>  A worker who has enough Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, but who is not currently receiving benefits on his or her own Social Security record and who is not a Medicare beneficiary, can obtain an estimate of the retirement benefit that will be provided, for different assumptions about age at retirement.</p>

Tax on wages and self-employment income</st>
<p>

Benefits are funded by taxes imposed on wages of employees and self-employed persons. As explained below, in the case of employment, the employer and employee are each responsible for one half of the Social Security tax, with the employee's half being withheld from the employee's pay check. In the case of self-employed persons (i.e., independent contractors), the self-employed person is responsible for the entire amount of Social Security tax.</p>
<p>

The <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../096/560096.xml">
Federal Insurance Contributions Act</link></it> (FICA) (codified in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../327/1836327.xml">
Internal Revenue Code</link>) imposes a Social Security withholding tax equal to 6.20% of the gross wage amount, up to but not exceeding the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/4994437.xml">
Social Security Wage Base</link></it> ($94,200 for the year 2006; $97,500 for 2007; and $102,000 for 2008). The same 6.20% tax is imposed on employers. For each calendar year for which the worker is assessed the FICA contribution, the SSA credits those wages as that year's covered wages. The income cutoff is adjusted yearly for inflation and other factors.</p>
<p>

A separate payroll tax of 1.45% of an employee's income is paid directly by the employer, and an additional 1.45% deducted from the employee's paycheck, yielding a total tax rate of 2.90%.  There is no maximum limit on this portion of the tax.  This portion of the tax is used to fund the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">
Medicare</link> program, which is primarily responsible for providing health benefits to retirees.</p>
<p>

The combined tax rate of these two federal programs is 15.30% (7.65% paid by the employee and 7.65% paid by the employer).</p>

 claimed that the federal government has broken its own promise regarding the maximum Social Security tax. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22120%22])">120</ref> Williams used data from the federal government to back up his claim.</p>
<p>

According to a 1936 pamphlet on the Social Security website, the federal government promised the following maximum level of taxation for Social Security, "... beginning in 1949, twelve years from now, you and your employer will each pay 3 cents on each dollar you earn, up to $3,000 a year. That is the most you will ever pay." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22121%22])">121</ref></p>
<p>

However, according to the Social Security website, by the year 2008, the tax rate was 6.2% each for the employer and employee, and the maximum income level that was subject to the tax was $102,000 raising the bar to $6,324 maximum contribution by both employee and employer (total $12,468). <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22122%22])">122</ref></p>
<p>

Williams wrote, "Had Congress lived up to those promises, where $3,000 was the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax, controlling for inflation, today's $50,000-a-year wage earner would pay about $700 in Social Security taxes, as opposed to the more than $3,000 that he pays today." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22120%22])">120</ref></p>
<p>

According to the Social Security website, "The tax rate in the original 1935 law was 1% each on the employer and the employee, on the first $3,000 of earnings. This rate was increased on a regular schedule in four steps so that by 1949 the rate would be 3% each on the first $3,000. The figure was never $,1400, and the rate was never fixed for all time at 1%." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22123%22])">123</ref></p>

Claim that it gives a low rate of return</st>
<p>

Critics of Social Security <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22124%22])">124</ref> claim that it gives a low rate of return, compared to what is obtained through private retirement accounts.  For example, critics point out <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22124%22])">124</ref>  that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed to opt out of the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22124%22])">124</ref>. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/he99031.pdf">
GAO report</weblink> to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, the outcome may be less favorable.</p>

 argues in his books and columns that Social Security is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../732/48732.xml">
pyramid scheme</link>.  For example, in <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=1505">
"Social Security: The Enron That Politicians Have In the Closet"</weblink>, he writes:</p>

<indent level="1">

Social Security has been a pyramid scheme from the beginning. Those who paid in first received money from those who paid in second — and so on, generation after generation. This was great so long as the small generation when Social Security began was being supported by larger generations resulting from the baby boom.

But, like all pyramid schemes, the whole thing is in big trouble once the pyramid stops growing. When the baby boomers retire, that will be the moment of truth — or of more artful lies. Just like <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Proposals to reform of the Social Security system have led to heated debate, centering around funding of the program. In particular, proposals to <it>privatize</it> funding has caused great controversy. </p>

<ss1>
<st>
Contrast with private pensions</st>
<p>

Although Social Security is sometimes compared to private pensions, this is an improper comparison since Social Security is social insurance and not a retirement plan.  The payment of disability benefits also distinguishes Social Security from most private pensions. In other ways the two systems are fundamentally different as well. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot "prefund" by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government.  As a result, its investments to date have been limited to "special" non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/293544.xml">
Federal National Mortgage Association</link> and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards.  Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities.  As a universal system, Social Security operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled.  There is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, and by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.   </p>
<p>

Two broad categories of private pension plans are "defined benefit pension plans" and "defined contribution pension plans." Of these two, Social Security is more similar to a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based on some sort of pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts for each participant. By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of individual accounts (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, <post wordnetid="108624385" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Social Security debate (United States)</link>.</p>
<p>

Both "defined benefit" and "defined contribution" private pension plans are governed by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../160/889160.xml">
Employee Retirement Income Security Act</link> (ERISA), which requires employers to provide minimum levels of funding to support "defined benefits" pensions.  The purpose is to protect the workers from corporate mismanagement and outright <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/4695.xml">
bankruptcy</link>, although in practice many private pension funds have fallen short in recent years.  In terms of financial structure, the current Social Security system is analogous to an underfunded "defined benefit" pension ("underfunded" meaning not that it is in trouble, but that its "savings" are not enough to pay future benefits without collecting future tax revenues).</p>

</ss1>

<st>
Court interpretation of the Act to provide benefits</st>
<p>

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has indicated that the Social Security Act has a moral purpose and should be liberally interpreted in favor of claimants when deciding what counted as covered wages for purposes of meeting the quarters of coverage requirement to make a worker eligible for benefits.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22126%22])">126</ref> That court has also stated: ". .  .

Constitutionality </st>

The constitutionality of Social Security is intricately linked to the evolving nature of Supreme Court jurisprudence on federal power (the 20th century saw a dramatic increase in allowed congressional action). When Social Security was first passed, there were significant questions over its constitutionality as the Court had found another pension scheme, the original Railroad Retirement Act, to violate the due process clause of the <amendment wordnetid="101250101" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../275/26275.xml">
Robert Nozick</link></philosopher>
, have argued that Social Security should be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>

In the 1937 U.S. Supreme Court case of <it><case wordnetid="107308889" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../989/18490989.xml">
Helvering v. Davis</link></case>
</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22130%22])">130</ref>, the Court examined the constitutionality of Social Security when George Davis of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston sued in connection with the Social Security tax. The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts first upheld the tax. The District Court judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Commissioner Guy Helvering of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) took the case to the Supreme Court, and the Court upheld the validity of the tax.</p>
<p>

During the 1930s President <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/10979.xml">
Franklin Delano Roosevelt</link> was in the midst of promoting the passage of a large number of social welfare programs under the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/19283361.xml">
New Deal</link></it> and the High Court struck down many of those programs (such as the <administrative_unit wordnetid="108077292" confidence="0.8">
<agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/7821.xml">
Civilian Conservation Corps</link></agency>
</administrative_unit>
 and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/235354.xml">
National Recovery Act</link>) as unconstitutional. After having a significant portion of his enactments struck down by the Supreme Court, Roosevelt proposed legislation that would have expanded the Supreme Court to fifteen members. This would have allowed him to nominate six additional members (under certain conditions) which would be more likely to uphold his enactments with his members in place. Believing that its autonomy and independence were significantly threatened by the legislation, the Supreme Court's tone seemed to change significantly. The Court allowed many <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/19283361.xml">
New Deal</link></it> programs very similar to ones they had previously struck down to go through, including Social Security.  (<it>see also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../837/2675837.xml">
The switch in time that saved nine</link></it>)</p>
<p>

When <it>Helvering v. Davis</it> was argued before the Court, the larger issue of whether or not the old-age insurance portion of Social Security is constitutional was not decided. The case was limited to whether or not the payroll tax was a suitable use of Congress's taxing power.  Despite this, no serious challenges regarding the system's constitutionality are now being litigated, and Congress's spending power may be more coextensive, as shown in cases like <it>South Dakota v. Dole</it><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%22131%22])">131</ref> during the Reagan Administration.</p>

Social security number fraud</st>
<p>

Because Social Security Numbers have become useful in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/180609.xml">
identity theft</link> and other forms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/5785.xml">
crime</link>, various schemes have been perpetrated to acquire valid Social Security Numbers and related identity information.  </p>
<p>

In February 2006, the Social Security Administration received several reports of an email message being circulated addressed to “Dear Social Security Number And Card owner” and purporting to be from the Social Security Administration. The message informs the reader “that someone illegally is using your Social Security number and assuming your identity” and directs the reader to a website designed to look like Social Security’s Internet website.</p>
<p>

“I am outraged that someone would target an unsuspecting public in this manner,” said Commissioner <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/4139755.xml">
Jo Anne B. Barnhart</link>. “I have asked the Inspector General to use all the resources at his command to find and prosecute whoever is perpetrating this fraud.” See <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/PhishingScam-pr.htm">
Press Release</weblink>. </p>
<p>

Once directed to the phony website, the individual is reportedly asked to confirm his or her identity with “Social Security and bank information.” Specific information about the individual’s credit card number, expiration date and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/337220.xml">
PIN</link>  is then requested. “Whether on our online website or by phone, Social Security will never ask you for your credit card information or your PIN” Commissioner <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/4139755.xml">
Jo Anne B. Barnhart</link> reported.</p>
<p>

Social Security Administration Inspector General O’Carroll recommended people always take precautions when giving out personal information. “You should never provide your Social Security number or other personal information over the Internet or by telephone unless you are extremely confident of the source to whom you are providing the information,” O’Carroll said.

Abuse of Social Security by Texas School districts</st>
<p>

In January 2007 the Social Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued an <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ssa.gov/oig/ADOBEPDF/A-09-06-26086.pdf">
Audit Report</weblink> indicating large-scale abuse of the Social Security program by 7 small school districts in Texas.  OIG concluded that the actions of these school districts would ultimately cause the Social Security program to pay ineligible beneficiaries about $2.2 billion. Essentially, the districts hired retiring teachers, normally exempt from Social Security, to work for a single day each in employment covered by Social Security.  Most of the one-day workers were hired as "janitors."  By withholding $2 or $3 of FICA tax from their paychecks, the retiring teachers became eligible (ostensibly) for benefits that are not normally available to American workers.
