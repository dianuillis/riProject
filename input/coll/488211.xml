<b>Codd's 12 rules</b> are a set of thirteen rules (numbered zero to twelve) proposed by <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, a pioneer of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/26220.xml">
relational model</link> for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link>s, designed to define what is required from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../513/8513.xml">
database management system</link> in order for it to be considered <it>relational</it>, i.e., an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/98743.xml">
RDBMS</link>. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><p>

Codd produced these rules as part of a personal campaign to prevent his vision of the relational database being diluted, as database vendors scrambled in the early 1980s to repackage existing products with a relational veneer. Rule 12 was particularly designed to counter such a positioning. In fact, the rules are so strict that all popular so-called "relational" DBMSs fail on many of the criteria.</p>

<sec>
<st>
 The rules </st>
<p>

<b>Rule 0:</b> The system must qualify as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/26220.xml">
relational</link></it>, as a <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link></it>, and as a <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../362/221362.xml">
management system</link></it>.
<indent level="1">

For a system to qualify as a relational database management system (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/98743.xml">
RDBMS</link>), that system must use its <it>relational</it> facilities (exclusively) to <it>manage</it> the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link></it>.
</indent>

<b>Rule 1:</b> The <it>information rule</it>:
<indent level="1">

All information in the database is to be represented in one and only one way, namely by values in column positions within rows of tables.
</indent>

<b>Rule 2:</b> The <it>guaranteed access rule</it>:
<indent level="1">

All data must be accessible with no ambiguity. This rule is essentially a restatement of the fundamental requirement for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../099/6850099.xml">
primary keys</link>. It says that every individual scalar value in the database must be logically addressable by specifying the name of the containing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/274698.xml">
table</link>, the name of the containing column and the primary key value of the containing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/1641678.xml">
row</link>.
</indent>

<b>Rule 3:</b> <it>Systematic treatment of null values</it>:
<indent level="1">

The DBMS must allow each field to remain null (or empty). Specifically, it must support a representation of "missing information and inapplicable information" that is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../048/1647048.xml">
systematic</link>, distinct from all regular values (for example, "distinct from zero or any other number", in the case of numeric values), and independent of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../817/93817.xml">
data type</link>. It is also implied that such representations must be manipulated by the DBMS in a systematic way.
</indent>

<b>Rule 4:</b> <it>Active <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../440/41440.xml">
online</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/5681954.xml">
catalog</link> based on the relational model</it>:
<indent level="1">

The system must support an online, inline, relational <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/5681954.xml">
catalog</link> that is accessible to authorized users by means of their regular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/494528.xml">
query language</link>. That is, users must be able to access the database's structure (catalog) using the same query language that they use to access the database's data.
</indent>

<b>Rule 5:</b> The <it>comprehensive data sublanguage rule</it>:
<indent level="1">

The system must support at least one relational language that 
</indent>
::# Has a <link>
linear syntax</link>
<list>
<entry level="3" type="number">

 Can be used both interactively and within application programs, </entry>
<entry level="3" type="number">

 Supports data definition operations (including view definitions), data manipulation operations (update as well as retrieval), security and integrity constraints, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/234240.xml">
transaction</link> management operations (begin, commit, and rollback).</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<b>Rule 6:</b> The <it>view updating rule</it>:
<indent level="1">

All views that are theoretically updatable must be updatable by the system.
</indent>

<b>Rule 7:</b> <it>High-level insert, update, and delete</it>:
<indent level="1">

The system must support set-at-a-time <it>insert</it>, <it>update</it>, and <it>delete</it> operators. This means that data can be retrieved from a relational database in sets constructed of data from multiple rows and/or multiple tables. This rule states that insert, update, and delete operations should be supported for any retrievable set rather than just for a single row in a single table.
</indent>

<b>Rule 8:</b> <it>Physical data independence</it>:
<indent level="1">

Changes to the physical level (how the data is stored, whether in arrays or linked lists etc.) must not require a change to an application based on the structure.
</indent>

<b>Rule 9:</b> <it>Logical data independence</it>:
<indent level="1">

Changes to the logical level (tables, columns, rows, and so on) must not require a change to an application based on the structure. Logical data independence is more difficult to achieve than physical data independence.
</indent>

<b>Rule 10:</b> <it>Integrity independence</it>:
<indent level="1">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../413/10218413.xml">
Integrity constraints</link> must be specified separately from application programs and stored in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/5681954.xml">
catalog</link>. It must be possible to change such constraints as and when appropriate without unnecessarily affecting existing applications.
</indent>

<b>Rule 11:</b> <it>Distribution independence</it>:
<indent level="1">

The distribution of portions of the database to various locations should be invisible to users of the database. Existing applications should continue to operate successfully :
</indent>
::# when a distributed version of the DBMS is first introduced; and
<list>
<entry level="3" type="number">

 when existing distributed data are redistributed around the system.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

<b>Rule 12:</b> The <it>nonsubversion rule</it>:
<indent level="1">

If the system provides a low-level (record-at-a-time) interface, then that interface cannot be used to subvert the system, for example, bypassing a relational security or integrity constraint.
