<b>Fuzzy logic</b> is a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/38024.xml">
multi-valued logic</link> derived from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/56601.xml">
fuzzy set</link> theory to deal with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/89755.xml">
reasoning</link> that is approximate rather than precise. Just as in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/56601.xml">
fuzzy set theory</link> the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/1808639.xml">
set membership values</link> can range (inclusively) between 0 and 1, in fuzzy logic the degree of truth of a statement can range between 0 and 1 and is not constrained to the two truth values {true, false} as in classic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/74970.xml">
predicate logic</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> And when <it>linguistic variables</it> are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions, as discussed below.</p>
<p>

The term "fuzzy logic" emerged in the development of the theory of fuzzy sets by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/201155.xml">
Lotfi Zadeh</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. The first paper on Fuzzy Logic (defined as a multivalued logic based upon set theory) was published by R.H. Wilkinson in 1963 following his first proposals in his 1961 Electrical Engineering master thesis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> He was the first one to redefine the earlier multivalued logics in terms of set theory. The main purpose of his paper was to show how any mathematical function could be simulated using hardwired analog electronic circuits based upon what he called analog logic. He did this by first creating various linear voltage ramps which were then selected in a "logic block" using diodes and resistor circuits which implemented the maximum and minimum Fuzzy Logic rules of the INCLUSIVE OR and the AND operations respectively. He called his logic analog logic.  </p>
<p>

In 1965 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/201155.xml">
Lotfi Zadeh</link> (then an Electrical Engineering systems professor) axiomatized the logic of Wilkinson without the electrical circuits and without giving Wilkinson any credit.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Fuzzy Logic has been applied to diverse fields from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../039/7039.xml">
control theory</link> to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/1164.xml">
artificial intelligence</link>, yet still remains controversial among most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../661/48661.xml">
statistician</link>s who prefer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/5017608.xml">
probabilistic logic</link> and some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../039/7039.xml">
control engineers</link> who prefer traditional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/55868.xml">
two valued logic</link>.</p>

Degrees of truth</st>
<p>

Both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../311/537311.xml">
degrees of truth</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/22934.xml">
probabilities</link> range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem similar at first. However, they are distinct conceptually; truth represent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../639/1808639.xml">
membership</link> in vaguely defined sets, not <it>likelihood</it> of some event or condition as in probability theory. For example, let a 100-ml glass contain 30 ml of water. Then we may consider two concepts: Empty and Full. The meaning of each of them can be represented by a certain fuzzy set. Then one might define the glass as being 0.7 empty and 0.3 full. Note that the concept of emptiness would be subjective and thus would depend on the observer or designer.  Another designer might equally well design a set membership function where the glass would be considered full for all values down to 50 ml. It is essential to realize that fuzzy logic uses truth degrees as a mathematical model of the vagueness phenomenon while probability is a mathematical model of randomness. </p>
<p>

A probabilistic setting would first define a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../060/53060.xml">
scalar</link> variable for the fullness of the glass, and second, conditional distributions describing the probability that someone would call the glass full given a specific fullness level.  This model, however, has no sense without accepting occurrence of some event, e.g. that after a few minutes, the glass will be half empty. Note that the conditioning can be achieved by having a specific observer that randomly selects the label for the glass, a distribution over deterministic observers, or both. Consequently, probability has nothing in common with fuzziness, these are simply different concepts which superficially seem similar because of using the same interval of real numbers [0, 1].</p>

Applying truth values</st>
<p>

A basic application might characterize subranges of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../818/32818.xml">
continuous variable</link>.  For instance, a temperature measurement for <occupation wordnetid="100582388" confidence="0.8">
<application wordnetid="100949134" confidence="0.8">
<technology wordnetid="100949619" confidence="0.8">

 might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range. These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled.</p>
<p>

<image location="center" width="150px" src="Fuzzy_logic_temperature_en.svg">
</image>
</p>
<p>

In this image, the meaning of the expressions <it>cold</it>, <it>warm</it>, and <it>hot</it> is represented  by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/161711.xml">
truth values</link>" &mdash; one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as "not hot". The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as "slightly warm" and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) "fairly cold".</p>

<st>
Linguistic variables</st>
<p>

While variables in mathematics usually take numerical values, in fuzzy logic applications, the non-numeric <it>linguistic variables</it> are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

A linguistic variable such as <it>age</it> may have a value such as <it>young</it> or its antonym <it>old</it>. However, the great utility of linguistic variables is that they can be modified via linguistic hedges applied to primary terms. The linguistic hedges can be associated with certain functions. For example, L. A. Zadeh proposed to take the square of the membership function. This model, however, does not work properly. For more details, see the references.</p>

<st>
An example of fuzzy reasoning</st>
<p>

Fuzzy Set Theory defines Fuzzy Operators on Fuzzy Sets. The problem in applying this is that the appropriate Fuzzy Operator may not be known. For this reason, Fuzzy logic usually uses IF-THEN rules, or constructs that are equivalent, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/1028755.xml">
fuzzy associative matrices</link>.</p>
<p>

Rules are usually expressed in the form:
IF <it>variable</it> IS <it>property</it> THEN <it>action</it></p>
<p>

For example, an extremely simple temperature regulator that uses a fan might look like this:
IF temperature IS very cold THEN stop fan
IF temperature IS cold THEN turn down fan
IF temperature IS normal THEN maintain level
IF temperature IS hot THEN speed up fan</p>
<p>

Notice there is no "ELSE".  All of the rules are evaluated, because the temperature might be "cold" and "normal" at the same time to different degrees.</p>
<p>

The AND, OR, and NOT <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../153/18153.xml">
operators</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../124/12351124.xml">
boolean logic</link> exist in fuzzy logic, usually defined as the minimum, maximum, and complement; when they are defined this way, they are called the <it>Zadeh operators</it>, because they were first defined as such in Zadeh's original papers. So for the fuzzy variables x and y:</p>
<p>

NOT x = (1 - truth(x))</p>
<p>

x AND y = minimum(truth(x), truth(y))</p>
<p>

x OR y = maximum(truth(x), truth(y))</p>
<p>

There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called <it>hedges</it> that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as "very", or "somewhat", which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula.</p>
<p>

In application, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/23015.xml">
programming language</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/23485.xml">
Prolog</link> is well geared to implementing fuzzy logic with its facilities to set up a database of "rules" which are queried to deduct logic.  This sort of programming is known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/17927_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
logic programming</link>.</p>
<p>

Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/25873.xml">
relational database</link>s. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Maria Zemankova's</link></person>
 dissertation. After, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../636/36636.xml">
Medina</link>, M.A. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/408540.xml">
Vila</link> et al. In the context of fuzzy databases, some fuzzy querying languages have been defined, highlighting the <link>
SQLf</link> by P. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../900/2376900.xml">
Bosc</link> et al. and the <link>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 If a male is 1.8 meters, consider him as tall:</entry>
</list>

IF male IS true AND height &amp;gt;= 1.8 THEN is_tall IS true; is_short IS false</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The fuzzy rules do not make sharp distinction between tall and short, that is not so realistic:</entry>
</list>

IF height = medium male THEN is_short IS agree somewhat
IF height &amp;gt;= medium male THEN is_tall IS agree somewhat</p>
<p>

In the fuzzy case, there are no such heights like 1.83 meters, but there are fuzzy values, like the following assignments:</p>
<p>

dwarf male = [0, 1.3] m
short male = [1.3, 1.5] m
medium male = [1.5, 1.8] m
tall male = [1.8, 2.0] m
giant male &amp;gt; 2.0 m</p>
<p>

For the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/804778.xml">
consequent</link>, there are also not only two values, but five, say:</p>
<p>

agree not = 0
agree little = 1
agree somewhat = 2
agree a lot = 3
agree fully = 4</p>
<p>

In the binary, or "crisp", case, a person of 1.79 meters of height is considered medium. If another person is 1.8 meters or 2.25 meters, these persons are considered tall.</p>
<p>

The crisp example differs deliberately from the fuzzy one. We did not put in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../141/2012141.xml">
antecedent</link> </p>
<p>

IF male &amp;gt;= agree somewhat AND ...</p>
<p>

as gender is often considered as a binary information. So, it is not so complex as being tall.</p>

Decidability issues for fuzzy logic</st>
<p>

The notions of a "decidable subset" and "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/332090.xml">
recursively enumerable</link> subset" are basic ones for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/1178398.xml">
classical mathematics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/55868.xml">
classical logic</link>. Then, the question of a suitable extension of such concepts to fuzzy set theory arises. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of <it>fuzzy <invention wordnetid="105633385" confidence="0.8">
<know-how wordnetid="105616786" confidence="0.8">
<method wordnetid="105660268" confidence="0.8">

Turing machine</link></method>
</know-how>
</invention>
</it>, <it>Markov normal fuzzy algorithm</it> and <it>fuzzy program</it>. Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla showed that such a definition is not adequate and therefore proposed the following one. <it>Ü</it> denotes the set of rational numbers in [0,1].
A fuzzy subset <it>s</it> : <it>S</it> <math>\rightarrow</math>[0,1] of a set <it>S</it> is <it>recursively enumerable</it> if a recursive map <it>h</it> : <it>S</it>×<it>N</it> <math>\rightarrow</math><it>Ü</it> exists such that, for every <it>x</it> in <it>S</it>, the function <it>h</it>(<it>x</it>,<it>n</it>) is increasing with respect to <it>n</it> and <it>s</it>(<it>x</it>) = lim <it>h</it>(<it>x</it>,<it>n</it>).
We say that <it>s</it> is <it>decidable</it> if both <it>s</it> and its complement –<it>s</it> are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is proposed in Gerla 2006.
The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property). </p>
<p>

<b>Theorem.</b> Any axiomatizable fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the fuzzy set of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.</p>
<p>

It is an open question to give supports for a <it>Church thesis</it> for fuzzy logic claiming that the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. To this aim, further investigations on the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy Turing machine should be necessary (see for example Wiedermann's paper). Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of <link>
Gödel</link>’s theorems to fuzzy logic.</p>

Fuzzy logic is the same as "imprecise logic". </entry>
<entry level="1" type="indent">

Fuzzy logic is not any less precise than any other form of logic: it is an organized and mathematical method of handling <it>inherently</it> imprecise concepts. The concept of "coldness" cannot be expressed in an equation, because although temperature is a quantity, "coldness" is not. However, people have an idea of what "cold" is, and agree that there is no sharp cutoff between "cold" and "not cold", where something is "cold" at N degrees but "not cold" at N+1 degrees &mdash; a concept classical logic cannot easily handle due to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../097/24097.xml">
principle of bivalence</link>. The result has no set answer so it is believed to be a 'fuzzy' answer. Fuzzy logic simply provides a mathematical model of the vagueness which is manifested in the above example.</entry>

Fuzzy logic is a new way of expressing probability. </entry>
<entry level="1" type="indent">

Fuzzy logic and probability are different ways of expressing uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can be used to represent subjective belief, fuzzy set theory uses the concept of fuzzy set membership (i.e. <it>how much</it> a variable is in a set), probability theory uses the concept of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/4890.xml">
subjective probability</link> (i.e. <it>how probable</it> do I think that a variable is in a set). While this distinction is mostly philosophical, the fuzzy-logic-derived <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../425/1504425.xml">
possibility measure</link> is inherently different from the <link>
probability measure</link>, hence they are not <it>directly</it> equivalent. However, many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../829/140829.xml">

 from the concept of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../601/56601.xml">
fuzzy subsethood</link>. Lotfi Zadeh argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to <link>
fuzzy probability</link> and also generalized it to what is called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../425/1504425.xml">
possibility theory</link>. Other approaches to uncertainty include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/226660.xml">

Fuzzy logic will be difficult to scale to larger problems.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="indent">

This criticism is mainly because there exist problems with conditional possibility, the fuzzy set theory equivalent of conditional probability (see Halpern (2003), Section 3.8). This makes it difficult to perform inference. However there have not been many studies comparing fuzzy-based systems with probabilistic ones.</entry>
