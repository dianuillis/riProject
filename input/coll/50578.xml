<b>Queueing theory</b> is the mathematical study of waiting lines (or <it>s</it>). The theory enables mathematical analysis of several related processes, including arriving at the (back of the) queue, waiting in the queue (essentially a storage process), and being served by the server(s) at the front of the queue. The theory permits the derivation and calculation of several performance measures including the average waiting time in the queue or the system, the expected number waiting or receiving service and the probability of encountering the system in certain states, such as empty, full, having an available server or having to wait a certain time to be served.

Overview </st>
<p>

The word <it>queue</it> comes, via <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/10597.xml">
French</link></language>
, from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/17730.xml">
Latin</link> <it>cauda</it>, meaning tail.  Most researchers in the field prefer the spelling "queueing" over "queuing",<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> although the latter is somewhat more common in other contexts.</p>
<p>

Queueing theory is generally considered a branch of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../476/43476.xml">
operations research</link> because the results are often used when making business decisions about the resources needed to provide service. It is applicable in a wide variety of situations that may be encountered in business, commerce, industry, healthcare,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> public service and engineering. Applications are frequently encountered in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/978916.xml">

Kendall's notation</link> introduced an A/B/C queueing notation that can be found in all standard modern works on queueing theory, for example, Tijms.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The A/B/C notation designates a queueing system having A as interarrival time distribution, B as service time distribution, and C as number of servers. For example, "G/D/1" would indicate a General (may be anything) arrival process, a Deterministic (constant time) service process and a single server.

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../436/468436.xml">
public switched telephone network</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../436/468436.xml">
PSTN</link>) is designed to accommodate the offered traffic intensity with only a small loss. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/1522954.xml">
performance</link> of loss systems is quantified by their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/41212.xml">
grade of service</link>, driven by the assumption that if insufficient capacity is available, the call is refused and lost.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Alternatively, overflow systems make use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../465/925465.xml">
alternative routes</link> to divert calls via different paths &mdash; even these systems have a finite or maximum traffic carrying capacity.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

However, the use of queueing in PSTNs allows the systems to queue their customers' requests until free resources become available. This means that if traffic intensity levels exceed available capacity, customers' calls are here no longer lost; they instead wait until they can be served.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> This method is used in queueing customers for the next available operator.</p>
<p>

Queueing networks</st>
<p>

Queues can be chained to form queueing networks where the departures from one queue enter the next queue. Queueing networks can be classified into two categories: open queueing networks and closed queueing networks. Open queueing networks have an external input and an external final destination. Closed queueing networks are completely contained and the customers circulate continually never leaving the network.</p>

Role of Poisson process, exponential distributions</st>
<p>

A useful queueing model both (a) represents a real-life system with sufficient accuracy and (b) is analytically tractable. A queueing model based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/102660.xml">
Poisson process</link> and its companion exponential probability distribution often meets these two requirements. A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/102660.xml">
Poisson process</link> models random events (such as a customer arrival, a request for action from a web server, or the completion of the actions requested of a web server) as emanating from a memoryless process. That is, the length of the time interval from the current time to the occurrence of the next event does not depend upon the time of occurrence of the last event. In the <structure wordnetid="105726345" confidence="0.8">
<arrangement wordnetid="105726596" confidence="0.8">
<distribution wordnetid="105729036" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/41561.xml">
Poisson probability distribution</link></distribution>
</arrangement>
</structure>
, the observer records the number of events that occur in a time interval of fixed length. In the (negative) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/45906.xml">
exponential probability distribution</link>, the observer records the length of the time interval between consecutive events. In both, the underlying physical process is memoryless. </p>
<p>

Models based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/102660.xml">
Poisson process</link> often respond to inputs from the environment in a manner that mimics the response of the system being modeled to those same inputs. The analytically tractable models that result yield both information about the system being modeled and the form of their solution. Even a queueing model based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/102660.xml">
Poisson process</link> that does a relatively poor job of mimicking detailed system performance can be useful. The fact that such models often give "worst-case" scenario evaluations appeals to system designers who prefer to include a safety factor in their designs. Also, the form of the solution of models based on the Poisson process often provides insight into the form of the solution to a queueing problem whose detailed behavior is poorly mimicked. As a result, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../066/3151066.xml">
queueing model</link>s are frequently modeled as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../660/102660.xml">
Poisson process</link>es through the use of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/45906.xml">
exponential distribution</link>.</p>

Limitations of mathematical approach</st>
<p>

Classic queueing theory is often too mathematically restrictive to be able to model all real-world situations exactly. This restriction arises because the underlying assumptions of the theory do not always hold in the real world. </p>
<p>

For example; the mathematical models often assume infinite numbers of customers, infinite queue capacity, or no bounds on inter-arrival or service times, when it is quite apparent that these bounds must exist in reality. Often, although the bounds do exist, they can be safely ignored because the differences between the real-world and theory is not statistically significant, as the probability that such boundary situations might occur is remote compared to the expected normal situation. In other cases the theoretical solution may either prove intractable or insufficiently informative to be useful.</p>
<p>

Alternative means of analysis have thus been devised in order to provide some insight into problems which do not fall under the mathematical scope of queueing theory, though they are often scenario-specific since they generally consist of computer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/43444.xml">
simulation</link>s and/or of analysis of experimental data. See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../103/1577103.xml">
network traffic simulation</link>.</p>
