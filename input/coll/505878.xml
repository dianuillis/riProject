A <b>capital gains tax</b> (abbreviated: <b>CGT</b>) is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
tax</link> charged on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../870/301870.xml">
capital gain</link>s, the profit realized on the sale of a non-inventory <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/18934838.xml">
asset</link> that was purchased at a lower price. The most common capital gains are realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals and property. Not all countries implement a capital gains tax and most have different rates of taxation for individuals and corporations.</p>

dividend</link>s and capital gains on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../328/52328.xml">

debt</link> such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../899/72899.xml">
zero coupon bond</link>s. The tax is not separate in its own right, but forms part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/50845.xml">
income tax</link> system. The proceeds of an asset sold less its 'cost base' (the original cost plus addition for cost price increases over time) are the capital gain. Discounts and other concessions apply to certain taxpayers in varying circumstances. From the 21st of September 1999, after a report by <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 the 50% capital gains tax discount has been in place for individuals and some trusts that acquired the asset after that time, however the tax is levied without any adjustment to the cost base for inflation. The amount left after applying the discount is added to the assessable income of the taxpayer for that financial year.</p>
<p>

For individuals, the most significant exemption is the family home.  The sale of personal residential property is normally exempt from Capital Gains Tax, except for gains realized during any period in which the property was not being used as a persons personal residence (for example, being leased to other tenants) or portions attributable to business use.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Belgium</st>
<p>

Under the participation exemption, capital gains realised by a Belgian resident company on shares in a Belgian or foreign company are fully exempt from corporate income tax, provided that the dividends on the shares qualify for the participation exemption. For purposes of the participation exemption for capital gains the minimum participation test is not required.
Unrealised capital gains on shares that are recognised in the financial statements (which recognition is not mandatory) are taxable. But a roll-over relief is granted if, and as long as, the gain is booked in a separate reserve account on the balance sheet and is not used for distribution or allocation of any kind.</p>
<p>

As a counterpart to the new exemption of realised capital gains, capital losses on shares, both realised and unrealised, are no longer tax deductible. However, the loss incurred in connection with the liquidation of a subsidiary company remains deductible up to the amount of the paid-up share capital.</p>
<p>

Other capital gains are taxed at the ordinary rate. If the total amount of sales is used for the purchase of depreciable fixed assets within 3 years, the taxation of the capital gains will be spread over the depreciable period of these assets.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

Currently 50.00% of realized capital gains are taxed in <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/5042916.xml">

 at an individual's tax rate.  (ie $100 CG with 43% tax rate will attract $21.50 of tax.) Some exceptions apply, such as selling one's primary residence which may be exempt from taxation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

For example, if your capital gains (profit) is $100, you're only taxed on the first 50.00% at your marginal tax rate. For example, if you were in the top tax bracket you'd be taxed at approx 43%. Formula for this example using the top tax bracket would be as follows:</p>
<p>

(Capital gain x 50.00%) x marginal tax rate = capital tax gain</p>
<p>

= ($100 x 50.00%) x 43%</p>
<p>

= $50 x 43% </p>
<p>

= $21.50</p>
<p>

In this example your capital gains tax on $100 is $21.50, leaving you with $78.50.</p>
<p>

The formula is the same for capital losses and these can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future years' capital gains; capital losses not used in the current year can also be carried back to the previous three tax years to offset capital gains tax paid in those years.</p>
<p>

Unrealized capital gains are not taxed.</p>

Share dividends and realized capital gains on shares are charged 28% to individuals of gains up to DKK 45,500 (2007-level, adjusted annually), and at 43% of gains above that. As of 1 January 2008, an additional marginal rate of 45% will apply to  gains above DKK 100,000 (2007-level, adjusted annually) per year. Carryforward of realized losses on shares is allowed.</p>
<p>

Individuals' interest income from bank deposits and bonds, realized gains on property and other capital gains are taxed up to 59%, however, several exemptions occur, such as on selling one's principal private residence or on gains on selling bonds. Interest paid on loans is deductible, although in case the net capital income is negative, only approx. 33% tax credit applies.</p>
<p>

Companies are taxed at 25%. However, for instance, realized gains on shares owned more than three years are tax exempt and only 66% of share dividends are subject to taxation. Carryforward of realized losses on shares owned less than three years is allowed.</p>

<p>

Capital gains tax is a flat 16%, with an annual exclusion or allowance of €5600. Residents pay an additional 11.6% 'Social Charges', non-residents are not liable to this, there is a 15 year taper relief. However, in some specific situation tax can be reduced or eliminated (such as selling one's principal private residence).</p>
<p>

I think needs to be reviewed as after the first 5 years the amount decreased by 10% per year.</p>

Germany</st>
<p>

There is currently no capital gains tax after a holding period of one year for shares (if held in a private account not in a corporate account and if holding is less than 1% of the outstanding number of shares of the company) or ten years for real estate if held as private wealth (less than 3 transactions every ten years). 
Germany will introduce a very strict capital gains tax for shares, funds, certificates etc. from 2009 on. Real estate will still be free of capital gains tax if held for more than ten years.
The German capital gains tax will be 25% plus <link>
Solidaritätszuschlag</link> (add on tax to finance the 5 eastern states of Germany) plus <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../092/2555092.xml">
church tax</link> effectively coming to about 28%. 
No deductions of cost like custodian fees, travelling to and from annual shareholder meetings, legal and tax advice, interest paid on loans to buy shares etc. will be allowed any more from 2009 on.</p>

As of 2008, equities are considered long term capital if the holding period is one year or more. Long term capital gains from equities are not taxed if shares are sold through recognised stock exchange and STT is paid on the sale . However short term capital gain from equities held for less than one year, is taxed at 15% (Increased from 10% to 15% after Budget 2008-09) (plus surcharge and education cess). This is applicable only for transactions that attract Securities Transaction Tax (STT).</p>
<p>

Many other capital investments (house, buildings, real estate, bank deposits) are considered long term if the holding period is 3 or more years.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  Short term capital gains are taxed just as any other income and they can be negated against short term capital loss from the same business.</p>

F.A.Q on Capital Gains Tax in India</weblink></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Ireland</st>
<p>

There is a 20% tax on capital gains, with several exclusions and deductions (e.g. agricultural land, primary residence, transfers between spouses). Gains made where the asset was originally purchased before 2003 attract indexation relief (the cost of the asset can be multiplied by a published factor to reflect inflation). Costs of purchase and sale are deductible, and every person has an exempt band of €1,270 per year.</p>
<p>

The tax rate is 23% on certain investment policies, and rises to 40% on certain offshore gains when they are not declared in time.</p>
<p>

Tax on capital gains arising in the first nine months of the year must be paid by October 31st, and tax on capital gains arising in the last three months of the year must be paid by the following January 31st.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Italy</st>
<p>

Capital gains are taxed at a flat 12.5%.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Japan</st>
<p>

In Japan, there are two options for paying tax on capital gains. The first, Withholding Tax (源泉課税, Withholding Tax), taxes all proceeds (regardless of profit or loss) at 1.05%. The second method, declaring proceeds as "taxable income" (申告所得, "taxable income"), requires individuals to declare 26% of proceeds on their income tax statement.</p>
<p>

Many traders in Japan use both systems, declaring profits on the Withholding Tax system and losses as taxable income, minimizing the amount of income tax paid.</p>

Moldova</st>
<p>

Under the Moldovan Tax Code a capital gain is defined as the difference between the acquisition and the disposition price of the capital asset.  Only this difference (i.e. the gain) is taxable.  The applicable rate is half (1/2) of the income tax rate, which for individuals is 18% and for companies was 15% (but in 2008 is 0%).  Therefore, in 2008 the capital gain tax rate is 9% for individuals and 0% for companies.</p>
<p>

Not all types of assets are "capital assets".  Capital assets include: real estate; shares; stakes in limited liability companies etc.</p>

. </p>
<p>

However a "theoretical capital yield" of 4% is taxed at a rate of 30%. </p>
<p>

In other words, all property and savings (with the exception of owner-occupied dwelling, pensions, approved "green" investments and monies below a certain threshold) are taxed at 1.2% as a substitute for capital gains tax.</p>
<p>

Also, dividends and "proceeds (Dutch: vervreemdingswinsten) from significant stakes" (e.g. 5% or more of the ownership of a company) are taxed at 25%. So the latter can be seen as a capital gains tax.</p>

<p>

There is a capital gains tax on sale of home and property. Any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../870/301870.xml">
capital gain</link> (<it>mais-valia</it>) arising is taxable as income. For residents this is on a sliding scale from 12-40%. However, for residents the taxable gain is reduced by 50%. Proven costs that have increased the value during the last five years can be deducted. For non-residents, the capital gain is taxed at a uniform rate of 25%. The capital gain which arises on the sale of own homes or residences, which are the elected main residence of the taxpayer or his family, is tax free if the total profit on sale is reinvested in the acquisition of another home, own residence or building plot in Portugal.</p>
<p>

In 1986 and 1987 Portuguese corporations changed their capital structure by increasing the weight of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../804/68804.xml">
equity capital</link>. This was particularly notorious on quoted companies. In these two years, the government set up a large number of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
tax</link> incentives to promote equity capital and to encourage the quotation on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../168/28168.xml">
stock exchange</link>. Currently, for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../783/19372783.xml">
stock</link> held for more than twelve months the capital gain is exempt. The capital gain of stock held for shorter periods of time is taxable on 10%.</p>

Basics (Tax year April 2008-9)</st>

<p>

Individuals who are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom (and trustees of various trusts) are subject to a capital gains tax, with exceptions for, for example, principal private residences, holdings in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../268/69268.xml">
ISA</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/2590651.xml">
gilts</link>.  Certain other gains are allowed to be rolled over upon re-investment.  Investments in some start up enterprises are also exempt from CGT. </p>
<p>

Every individual has an annual capital gains tax allowance: gains below the allowance are exempt from tax, and capital losses can be set against capital gains in other holdings before taxation.  </p>
<p>

All individuals are exempt from CGT up to a specified amount of capital gains per year. For the 2008/9 tax year this "annual exemption" is £9,600.</p>
<p>

CGT is charged at 18%.</p>
<p>

Entrepreneurs selling their business (technically "qualifying assets") can claim Entrepreneurs' Relief - a lifetime allowance of £1,000,000 of gain that will only be taxed at 10%.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Corporate notes</st>
<p>

Companies are subject to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../441/594441.xml">
corporation tax</link> on their "chargeable gains" (the amounts of which are calculated along the lines of capital gains tax).  Companies cannot claim taper relief, but can claim an indexation allowance to offset the effect of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/38286.xml">
inflation</link>.  A corporate <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../590/6687590.xml">
substantial shareholdings exemption</link> was introduced on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../175/1175.xml">
1 April</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/35502.xml">
2002</link> for holdings of 10% or more of the shares in another company (30% or more for shares held by a life assurance company's long-term insurance fund). This is effectively a form of UK <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../333/16620333.xml">
participation exemption</link>. Almost all of the corporation tax raised on chargeable gains is paid by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/383367.xml">
life assurance</link> companies taxed on the <link>
I minus E basis</link>.</p>

<st>
Background to changes to 18% rate</st>
<p>

In the Chancellor's October 2007 Autumn Statement, draft proposals were announced that would change the applicable rates of CGT as of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/1008.xml">
6 April</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/35825.xml">
2008</link>. Under these proposals, an individual's annual exemption will continue but taper relief will cease and a single rate of capital gains tax at 18% will be applied to chargeable gains. This new single rate would replace the individual's marginal (Income Tax) rate of tax for CGT purposes. The changes were introduced, at least in part, because the UK government felt that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../280/191280.xml">
private equity</link> firms were making excessive profits by benefiting from overly generous taper relief on business assets. The changes were criticised by a number of groups including the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/11192407.xml">
Federation of Small Businesses</link>, who claimed that the new rules would increase the CGT liability of small businesses and discourage entrepreneurship in the UK<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>. At the time of the proposals there was concern that the changes would lead to a bulk selling of assets just before the start of the 2008-09 tax year to benefit from existing taper relief.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Historic (useful if looking at years prior to April 2008)</st>

<p>

Individuals pay capital gains tax at their highest marginal rate of income tax (0%, 10%, 20% or 40% in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../099/5752099.xml">
tax year</link> 2007/8) but since <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/1008.xml">
6 April</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/34647.xml">
1998</link> have been able to claim a <it><link>
taper relief</link></it> which reduces the amount of a gain that is subject to capital gains tax (reducing the effective rate of tax), depending on whether the asset is a "business asset" or a "non-business asset" and the length of the period of ownership. Taper relief provides up to a 75% reduction (leaving 25% taxable) in taxable gains for business assets, and 40% (leaving 60% taxable), for non-business assets, for an individual.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> Taper relief replaces indexation allowance for individuals, which can still be claimed for assets held prior to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/1008.xml">

In the United States, individuals and corporations pay <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/50845.xml">
income tax</link> on the net total of all their capital gains just as they do on other sorts of income, but the tax rate for individuals is lower on "long-term capital gains," which are gains on assets that had been held for over one year before being sold.  The tax rate on long-term gains was reduced in 2003 to 15%, or to 5% for individuals in the lowest two income tax brackets (See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/301892.xml">
progressive tax</link>).  Short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate: the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../763/9337763.xml">
ordinary income</link> tax rate.  The reduced 15% tax rate on <link>
eligible dividends</link> and capital gains, previously scheduled to expire in 2008, has been extended through 2010 as a result of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act signed into law by President Bush on May 17, 2006 (P.L. 109-222).  In 2011 these reduced tax rates will "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../045/880045.xml">
