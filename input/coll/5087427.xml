<b>Lemur</b> is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/1128868.xml">
toolkit</link> designed to facilitate research in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../810/1911810.xml">
language modeling</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/15271.xml">
information retrieval</link>, where information retrieval is broadly interpreted to include such technologies as ad hoc and distributed retrieval, with <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/296950.xml">
cross-language information retrieval</link>, summarization, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/2538139.xml">
filtering</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../717/72717.xml">
categorization</link>. The system's underlying <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/6509.xml">
architecture</link> was built to support the technologies above. Lemur provides many useful sample applications, but is designed to allow easy programming of users' own customizations and applications.<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.lemurproject.org/lemur/overview.html">

. It is primarily used for studying <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/4059023.xml">
search engine</link>s  and information retrieval in universities, but can have broader use in the greater commercial and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../758/18938758.xml">
open source</link> community. The underlying goal of the Lemur Project can be summarized from both an academic and industrial perspective: from an academic perspective, the Lemur Project encourages users to modify the Lemur Toolkit for their own learning, research, development, or teaching activities; from an industrial perspective, the Lemur Toolkit is efficient, well supported, and easy to integrate. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~strohman/indri/">
