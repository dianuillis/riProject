Activities</st>

<p>

The group is approximately 20 strong, 2 secretaries and 5 PhD students included. Some of the LERTIM members (6 in all) have two sets of responsibilities because of the way French medical schools and teaching hospitals are organized: they have teaching and research activities both in the Faculty of Medicine and the teaching hospital. Their faculty activities deal with research on medical informatics topics and fundamental aspects and their hospital activities with practical ones.</p>

Most of these descriptions are available (in French) on their web site.</p>
