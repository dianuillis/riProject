 range of mainframe computers. <p>

In later years ICL attempted to diversify its product line, but the bulk of its profits always depended on the mainframe customer base. New ventures included marketing a range of powerful IBM clones made by Fujitsu, various minicomputer and personal computer ranges, and (more successfully) a range of retail point-of-sale equipment and back-office software.</p>

 Origins of ICL </st>

<p>

International Computers Ltd was formed in 1968 as a part of the Industrial Expansion Act of the <chancellor wordnetid="109906986" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, the Minister of Technology, to create a British computer industry that could compete with major world manufacturers like <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/18622259.xml">
IBM</link></company>
. ICL represented the last step in a series of mergers that had taken place in the industry since the late 1950s.</p>
<p>

The main portions of ICL were formed by merging <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../117/2046117.xml">
International Computers and Tabulators</link> (ICT) with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/18555.xml">
English Electric Computers</link>, the latter itself a recent merger of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/2849306.xml">
Elliott Automation</link> with English Electric Leo Marconi computers. EELM was itself a merger of the computer divisions of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../889/390889.xml">

, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/18555.xml">
LEO</link> and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../936/1160936.xml">
Marconi</link></institution>
</company>
.</p>
<p>

On its formation the company inherited two main product lines: from ICT the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/1977278.xml">
ICT 1900</link> Series of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/20266.xml">
mainframes</link>, and from English Electric Computers (EEC) the System 4, a range of IBM-compatible mainframe clones, based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../267/12067267.xml">
RCA Spectra 70</link>.</p>
<p>

When the companies were first merged the EEC order books were full to over-bursting, while ICT, who had twice as many employees were struggling, probably because it was already obvious that the 1900 series was incompatible with the rest of the industry, being a 6 bit architecture. rather than the normal 8 (or 9 in the case of Honeywell). The new board decided that the 1900 should be phased out in favour of the System 4, but shortly afterwards reversed the decision. It is probable that this was due to union and political pressure from the Wilson government. In any event, most of the original EEC board resigned over the interference as they believed that the 1900 series was doomed from the outset, being incompatible with the rest of the market place. ICL initially thrived, but relied almost wholly on supplying UK government with computers. Very few were sold to non UK government users.</p>

. ICT had thus emerged with equipment that would process data encoded on punched cards - 40, 80 or 160 column cards in the case of ICT, compared to the 64 or 80 column cards used by IBM and its predecessors.</p>
<p>

In 1962 ICT delivered the first ICT 1300 series computer which was its first transistor machine and also the first to use core memory.</p>
<p>

In 1964 ICT purchased the computer division of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../059/1124059.xml">
Ferranti</link></company>
 in another government-forced merger. Ferranti had been building a small number of scientific machines based on various university designs since the 1950s. None of these could be considered commercially successful, however, and Ferranti always seemed to be slow bringing its designs to market.</p>
<p>

In 1962 a small team from Ferranti's Canadian subsidiary, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/1974230.xml">

</company>
, visited the various Ferranti computer labs and saw their work on a next-generation machine. On their return home they produced the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/3310134.xml">
Ferranti-Packard 6000</link> in an astonishingly short period of time, developing the machine, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/5739.xml">
compiler</link>s and an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> (before these were common) and putting it on the market by 1963. A feature of the Executive operating system was its ability to multi task, using dynamic memory allocation enabled with a magnetic drum as an intermediate random access device. The machine went on to have some success and sold in small numbers in Canada (Saskatchewan Power Corporation retired serial number 0001 in the early 1980s) and the United States.</p>
<p>

Meanwhile ICT management in England was looking to rejuvenate their lineup; their latest developments, the ones used to develop the FP 6000, were still not on the market. Management looked at the FP 6000 as well as licensing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../267/12067267.xml">
RCA Spectra 70</link>, an <platform wordnetid="103961939" confidence="0.8">

</platform>
-clone. In the end it was decided to go with the FP 6000 as the basis for a small line of small-to-midrange machines. The result was the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/1977278.xml">
ICT 1900</link> series, which would eventually go on to sell into the thousands.</p>
<p>

The 1900 Series, which derived from the Canadian <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/3310134.xml">
Ferranti-Packard 6000</link>, competed successfully in the UK with the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/18622259.xml">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/29294.xml">
System/360</link> range from the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s. The basic design was based on a 24 bit word, divided up into 6 bit characters.  Lower case and control characters were provided for by "shift" characters.  The early machines (1904/1905 with hardware floating point)) were only 15 bit addressing. Later machines (1904E, 1905E, 1906A) had extended addressing modes up to 22 bits. 
The operating systems (Executives) were</p>

, remembered with great affection by a generation of British programmers.</p>
<p>

A series of smaller machines were developed by the ICL Stevenage operation, consisting initially of the 1901 / 1902 / 1903 systems running E3 series executives (e.g. E3RM) and versions of the GEORGE operating system (initially GEORGE1).  Later developments were the 1901A / 1902A / 1903A with their own Executives and GEORGE2.</p>
<p>

At a time (in the 1960s and 1970s) when IBM/360 series programs had to be recompiled to run in different machine and/or operating system environments, one significant feature of the 1900 series was that programs would function unaltered on any 1900 system, i.e. without the need for recompilation. Unfortunately ICT, and later ICL, was unable to capitalise on this major advantage to make significant inroads into IBM's customer base.</p>

 English Electric LEO Marconi (EELM) </st>

<p>

During the same period of time, LEO was struggling to produce its own machines that would be able to compete with IBM. Its parent company, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../584/511584.xml">
J. Lyons and Co.</link>, simply didn't have the financial might to develop a new line of machines. Not wanting to see its work go to waste, it sold its computer division to <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../889/390889.xml">
English Electric</link></company>
.</p>
<p>

English Electric had developed a series of machines over the years, notably the famous <computer wordnetid="103082979" confidence="0.8">

 and the commercially-oriented <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../348/4995348.xml">
KDF8</link>, but never had much commercial success.</p>
<p>

Now with serious financial backing at its disposal, the new company nevertheless decided not to come up with its own design, and instead licensed the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/25970.xml">

 Spectra 70 (the design ICT rejected). The result was the <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 series.  While there were a number of models in the range, the smaller 4/10 and 4/30 were seen as underpowered, and the more successful variants were the larger 4/50 and 4/70 models. A model 4/75 was also supplied to the EELM (later Baric) Bureau subsidiary and installed at Winsford, Cheshire as the hardware for a bureau-developed commercial system for interactive use by bureau customers.  Although several multi-user commercial packages (e.g. sales and purchase ledger systems) were developed and trialed with customers, this was not commercially successful, and the service was soon withdrawn.</p>
<p>

The System 4 series ran the J (for Job) operating system. This was a batch operating system, although there was a variant that allowed interactive access called MultiJob. Programming languages used were assembler and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/6799.xml">
COBOL</link>. The system was controlled from a console comprised of a mechanical printer and keyboard &ndash; very like a Teletype. The assembly language (known as Usercode) non-privileged instruction set was identical to IBM System 360 Assembly Language; in privileged mode there were a few extras. </p>
<p>

System 4's compatibility with the IBM 360 made it particularly attractive to customers in <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">

Even before the merger that created ICL was complete, a working party had recommended that the new company should develop a new range of machines offering "acceptable compatibility with the current ranges of both companies". This was also seen as a way to help "achieve company unity" for the newly-formed organization. The resulting 2900 Series was launched on 9 October 1974. Its design drew on many sources, one being the Manchester University MU5, and it is still available in the guise of the Fujitsu Trimetra. </p>

In the early 1980s ICL struck a deal to acquire semiconductor technology from Fujitsu, on whom they became increasingly dependent as the years progressed. Eventually Fujitsu acquired ICL, and in 2002 the residue of the company was rebranded as Fujitsu's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/9239.xml">

 Operating systems </st>

<p>

At the inception of New Range development, two operating systems were planned: System B for the large processors, and System D for the mid-range. System B was subsequently renamed <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/75743.xml">
VME/B</link></O>
. A third operating system, System T, was subsequently targeted at small machines. System D was dropped in order to focus efforts on VME/B and System T, renamed to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/75743.xml">
VME/K</link> (Confusingly, VME/B was developed in <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/411574.xml">

, VME/K in <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../268/302268.xml">
Bracknell</link></site>
.) The first large machines (the 2980 and 2970) were launched with VME/B. VME/K first saw service on the 2960.</p>
<p>

The chief architect of VME/B was <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<professor wordnetid="110480730" confidence="0.9173553029164789">

, who subsequently became professor of software engineering at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

University of Manchester</link></university>
.</p>
<p>

VME/K development continued independently for several reasons. Early VME/B customers suffered significant performance and reliability problems, and the existence of an alternative product provided a safety net. Perhaps more significantly, VME/K was the brainchild of Ed Mack, who had been brought in by managing director Geoff Cross as ICL's head of research and development. Despite his wide responsibilities, Mack took a detailed personal interest in every aspect of VME/K design. To quote historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, "Mack had a good deal more autonomy than was good for the company." Not only was too much resource going into VME/K at the expense of the VME/B system that ICL's biggest customers were actually using, but the development of mainframe systems was also diverting expenditure from small business systems such as the 2903, whose sales were growing much more rapidly.</p>
<p>

ICL's finances deteriorated during the late 1970s, leading to the appointment of a new management team led by Robb Wilmot and Peter Bonfield. One of their first actions was to end VME/K development. This happened just at the time that VME/K had finally reached a level of performance and reliability that made it saleable; however, the customer base was very small, and by this time VME/B (which was renamed VME 2900) had also matured sufficiently to give confidence that it would meet the future requirements for the entire mainframe range.</p>
<p>

VME 2900 subsequently became simply VME and then Open VME, and continued to evolve. In 1980 it was marketed as "Your system for the 80s", and indeed that decade proved to be its heyday. It continued (and continues) to give service to many loyal and demanding users, but has attracted few new users since 1990 or so.</p>

Portability of C applications suffered from the assumptions made by many C programmers that characters would be encoded in ASCII and that short integers would always be 16 bits long (the 2900 architecture allows 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit arithmetic, but 16-bit arithmetic has to be implemented in software and is therefore inefficient).</col>

 2903 range </st>
<p>

A rapid development to produce a small business computer from, as far as possible, existing hardware and software. It was urgently needed to generate a cash flow that would support continuing 2900 development. The hardware was the 2900 DFC (Disk File Controller) installed in an L-shaped piece of furniture. This contained the system, operator's console, integral printer and disk storage. The 2903 used
microcode to emulate 1900 hardware. The operating system was George 1* (a modification of George 1S batch operating system) running on top of the UDAS Executive. In consequence, all the normal 1900 compilers and utilities ran on the 290x range without any changes or recompilation.</p>
<p>

One major new facility provided on this range was <link>
Direct Data Entry</link>, a system comprising up to eight dedicated VDU data entry stations, with which card image files could be created; these could be assigned to a program's card reader and processed accordingly.</p>
<p>

There were three models in the range:

<p>

The 290x operating system, known as 'Executive', allowed the machines to be operated 'manually' via a video console. GEORGE1* ran on top of Executive to control batch processes by means of JCL (Job Control Language), which was based very closely upon the macro language of the 1900 GEORGE1S operating system.</p>

TME was the operating system on the ME29 and required CL (Control Language) to run jobs - 'manual' operation being discouraged.</p>

Practically all the software packages available on the 1900 range ran on the 290x and ME29 systems.</p>

.  
Launched in 1986, DRS 300 was a modular system consisting of A4-sized units designed to be placed on an office bookshelf.
Modules containing a power supply (Kx), processor (Ax), hard and floppy disks (Dx), streamer tape (Sx) etc were connected by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/28313.xml">
SCSI</link>. Initial models used an 8&nbsp;MHz <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/15054.xml">

, in practice available applications were 
limited because many shrink-wrapped packages developed for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../032/15032.xml">

access to the (IBM) hardware. This was addressed through use of softclone technology to intercept such calls<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. However this required the continual release of patches for new application versions. </p>
<p>

The initial DRS 300 also ran ICL's implementation of Unix System V Release 2, DRS/NX V2. Later 
an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/15070.xml">

The in-house (Irvine/Bracknell) developed DRS 6000 was launched in January 1990 as a washing machine-sized 
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/36954.xml">
SPARC</link>-based server, running ICL's implementation of Unix System V Release 4 (<link>
SVR4</link>). It also
had a 68020-based Central Service Module board (CSM), leading to sarcastic comments in the press
that it was a DRS 400 in disguise. By 1992 there were desktop, slimline and full sized models, ranging 
from a single-processor desktop model rated at 29 MIPS (L240) to a 4-processor model rated at 116 
MIPS (L644). Some models were sold by Fujitsu as the DS/90. 
ICL received the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/1799478.xml">

The ICL 1900 Filan manual (1st edition January 1973) describes Filan as "a totally integrated system for the analysis of large quantities of complex data such as that collected in censuses and other surveys". It was used to process the 1971 Indonesian Population Census (see http://www.disc.wisc.edu/INDO/indo_report.html). In the UK, Filan was used during the 1970s by OPCS (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys) to process the General Household Survey data. As there was only a small user community, ICL decided not to convert the software to run on its 2900 range of computers in the 1980s.</p>

ICL had established a presence in India in its earliest days, through a partly-owned subsidiary International Computers India Manufacturing (ICIM). As the name implies, ICIM took on some of the manufacturing of ICL-designed equipment, generally for overseas markets. In later years ICIM, from its offices in <legal_power wordnetid="105198427" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, started to establish a presence in the market for offshore software development and eventually <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/235890.xml">
outsourcing</link> of the operation of computer services. ICIM subsequently became a joint operation with Fujitsu, establishing links to Japan that were as strong as its traditional links to the UK. Reflecting the shift in its business, the company was renamed ICIL (International Computers India Limited), and is now <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.zensar.com">

 Business Machines. Subsequently ICL also took on the development and manufacturing plant at Utica, New York. The Singer group (best known for their sewing machines) had diversified into computers and in 1970 launched the System Ten, a small business minicomputer. The acquisition shifted the geographical balance of ICL's sales away from the UK, and also gave a presence in industry markets such as retail and  manufacturing. ICL subsequently developed the System Ten into the System 25, and used the product to spearhead the growth of its Retail Systems business during the 1980s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Standard Telephones and Cables</link>. The stated rationale was the predicted convergence of computers and telecommunications. To the bemusement of many ICL staff, Corfield also announced that he thought ICL's marketing skills would complement STC's technical strengths. The ICL board recommended acceptance of the bid, and the takeover was completed on 10 September 1984. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../408/4476408.xml">

 Fujitsu </st>

<p>

ICL's relationship with Fujitsu started in 1981, when ICL needed a cheaper source of technology to develop lower-end machines in the 2900 range to compete with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/901635.xml">
IBM 4300 series</link>. At this stage ICL was developing its own LSI technology for use in the higher-end machines, designed as a successor to the highly-successful 2966 processor (known internally as S3). ICL had visited a number of companies during 1980 including Fujitsu and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../676/188676.xml">
Hitachi</link></company>
 to identify potential suppliers.</p>
<p>

In early 1981 ICL ran into a financial crisis, leading to a full takeover bid from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/144173.xml">
Univac</link>; but the British Government stepped in with a loan guarantee, enabling the company to stay independent. As part of this rescue agreement, Robb Wilmot arrived as CEO in May 1981.</p>
<p>

Wilmot cancelled ICL in-house <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../328/335328.xml">
LSI</link> technology development, and negotiated an agreement that gave access to Fujitsu's LSI and packaging technologies, which, when combined with ICL's in-house CAD capability, enabled ICL to design and manufacture the DM1 and Estriel machines, later marketed very profitably as Series 39 level 30 and 80.</p>
<p>

Initially the collaboration with Fujitsu was presented as being an arm's length one, to avoid diluting ICL's credentials as a European and British company. However, Fujitsu's involvement with ICL at both the financial and the technical level steadily increased over the subsequent two decades, leading first to 100% ownership and subsequently to the full integration of ICL into the Fujitsu company and the dropping of the ICL brand.</p>
<p>

In 1990 Fujitsu acquired 80% of ICL plc from the parent STC plc, paying USD 1.29 billion.</p>
