<b>Synthetic oil</b> is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
oil</link> consisting of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/144412.xml">
chemical compound</link>s which were not originally present in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
crude oil</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
petroleum</link>), but were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/2839842.xml">
artificially</link> made (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../338/330338.xml">
synthesized</link>) from other compounds.  Synthetic oil could be made to be a substitute for petroleum, or specially made to be a substitute for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/18069.xml">
lubricant</link> oil, such as conventional (or mineral) <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/216189.xml">
motor oil</link> refined from petroleum.  When a synthetic oil or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/2170613.xml">
synthetic fuel</link> is made as a substitute for petroleum, it is generally produced because of a shortage of petroleum or because petroleum is too expensive.  When synthetic oil is used as a substitute for lubricant refined from petroleum, it generally provides superior mechanical and chemical properties than those found in traditional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/212419.xml">
mineral oil</link>s.  </p>

<p>

One form of synthetic oil is that manufactured using the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../762/1284762.xml">

methane</link> into liquid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/13257.xml">

, which had limited access to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../195/23195.xml">
crude oil</link> supplies. Germany's yearly synthetic oil production reached millions of tons in 1944. It is today used in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../221/17416221.xml">

diesel</link>. Dr. <link>
Hermann Zorn</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../417/151417.xml">
I.G. Farben</link> Industrie in Germany actually began to search for lubricants with the properties of natural oils but without the tendencies to gel or gum when used in an engine environment.  His work led to the preparation of over 3500 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/9675.xml">

 U.S.A was the first to market and produce a complete range of 100% synthetic Polyalphaolefins based lubricants, which began to be marketed as a substitute for mineral oils for engine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../221/309221.xml">

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Hydrocracked/Hydroisomerized = API Group III base oils.  Chevron, Shell, and other petrochemical companies developed processes involving catalytic conversion of feed stocks under pressure in the presence of hydrogen into high quality mineral lubricating oil.  In 2005 production of GTL (Gas-to-liquid) Group III base stocks began.  The best of these perform much like polyalphaolefin.  Group III base stocks are considered synthetic motor oil ONLY in the United States. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. Group III based lubricants are not allowed to be marketed as "synthetic" in any market outside of the USA.</entry>

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Initial costs are usually four times greater than petroleum-based oils, though at one time, man-made oils cost ten times more than petroleum .  Initial costs are often mitigated by extended change intervals, which individuals may confirm through used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/2680184.xml">

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 The lower friction may make them unsuitable for break-in (i.e. the initial run-in period of the vehicle) where friction is desirable to cause wear.  Improved engine part machining has made break-in less critical than it once was though. Many modern cars now come with synthetic oil as a factory fill.</entry>

taxi cab</link>s and found no noticeable advantage of synthetic oil over regular oil<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. In their article, they noted that "Big-city cabs don't see many cold start-ups or long periods of high speed driving in extreme heat. But our test results relate to the most common type of severe service - stop-and-go city driving." According to their study, synthetic oil is "worth considering for extreme driving conditions: high ambient temperatures and high engine load, or very cold temperatures." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> This research was criticized by some because most engine damage appears to be caused by cold starts, and their research method may not have included enough cold starts to be representative of personal vehicle use.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></entry>

Semi-synthetic oils (also called 'synthetic blends') are blends of mineral oil with no more than 30% synthetic oil.  Designed to have many of the benefits of synthetic oil without matching the cost of pure synthetic oil.  <link>
