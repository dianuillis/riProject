<b>Oil of brick</b>, called by apothecaries <b>Oleum de Lateribus</b> and by alchemists <b>Oil of Philosophers</b>, was an empyreumatic oil obtained by subjecting a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../526/4526.xml">
brick</link> soaked in oil, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>, to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/8301.xml">
distillation</link> at a high temperature. The process initially started with pieces of brick, which were heated red hot in live coals, and extinguished in an earth half-saturated with olive oil. Being then separated and pounded grossly, the brick absorbs the oil. It was then put in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/1240961.xml">
retort</link>, and placed in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/1497553.xml">
reverberatory furnace</link>, where the oil was drawn out by fire. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><p>

Oil of brick was used in pre-modern medicine as a treatment for tumors, in the spleen, in palsies, and epilepsies <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. It was used by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../083/60083.xml">
lapidaries</link> as a vehicle for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../499/1101499.xml">
emery</link> by which stones and gems were sawn or cut. </p>
