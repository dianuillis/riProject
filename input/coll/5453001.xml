Housing Benefit</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../279/3187279.xml">
Council Tax Benefit</link> and help with health costs. A person with savings over £16,000 cannot get Income Support and savings over £6,000 affect how much Income Support can be received. The claimant must be between 16-59, inclusive, must work less than 16 hours a week, and must have a reason why they are not actively seeking work (on grounds of illness, disability, caring for children, or someone who is ill).

 Sickness </st>

<p>

Claimants may be entitled to Income Support if they are unable to work due to sickness and have no or reduced entitlement to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../374/12987374.xml">
Incapacity Benefit</link>. Normally a claim for both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/3332250.xml">
benefits</link> is made and the amount of Incapacity Benefit due is calculated according to the claimant's past <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../844/316844.xml">
National Insurance Contributions</link>. If too few contributions have been made for the full rates of Incapacity Benefit to be paid then Income Support may be paid to top-up the amount the claimant receives to Income Support rates.</p>
<p>

From October 27th 2008, Employment and Support Allowance will replace Income Support claimed on grounds of sickness or disability.</p>
<p>

All existing claims for Income Support will not be affected. New applicants for Income Support will be transferred to the new ESA.</p>

 The effect of Working Tax Credit on Income Support </st>

<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/3575825.xml">
Working Tax Credit</link> is only available for people working <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../797/1798797.xml">
full time</link> - If you are working full time you are not eligible for Income Support as your earnings will be over the Income support threshold</p>
<p>

Working Tax Credit,WTC, is taken into account when Income Support is calculated. It is important for claimants to report changes of circumstances to Working Tax Credits, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/651806.xml">
HM Revenue and Customs</link>, before making a claim for Income Support, this will prevent possible over-payments of WTC.</p>
