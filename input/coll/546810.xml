One of the greatest challenges facing the builders of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../849/24849.xml">
Panama Canal</link> was dealing with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/889672.xml">
tropical disease</link>s rife in the area. The <b>health measures</b> taken during the construction contributed greatly to the success of the canal's construction.  These included general health care, the provision of an extensive health infrastructure, and a major program to eradicate disease-carrying <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/37789.xml">
mosquito</link>es from the area.  These efforts were a great success, and contributed significantly to the overall success of the canal project.

 took control of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../849/24849.xml">
Panama Canal</link> project on May 4, 1904, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../472/1404472.xml">
isthmus of Panama</link> was already notorious for the terrible problem of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../672/889672.xml">
tropical disease</link>s.  It is estimated that 102,000 workers had died during the construction of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../036/392036.xml">
Panama Railway</link>, and 22,000 during the earlier French effort to build a canal. Many of these deaths were due to disease, particularly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../254/34254.xml">
yellow fever</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/20423.xml">
malaria</link>.  At several times, construction on the Panama Railway had actually halted due to the lack of any healthy workers.</p>
<p>

It was clear to the organizers of the American effort that the problem of disease had to be tackled before any major work could begin on the canal.  However, the United States had one advantage over the previous projects. Previous efforts at disease control had been largely ineffective, as the causes of the two main diseases were unknown, but in 1897 it was proved by Britain's <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 The Sanitation Effort </st>

<p>

Under the leadership of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../769/1936769.xml">
Gorgas</link>, many new departments of sanitation were founded, covering different aspects of the sanitation problem.  Commissions were also formed to look after the basic welfare of the laborers.</p>
<p>

The sanitation work included clearing land, establishing quarantine facilities, and taking care of sick and injured laborers in hospitals.  The government furnished all of its employees with free medicines, free medical attendance, and free hospital and burial services.  It dispensed about a ton of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/25297.xml">
quinine</link> a year.</p>
<p>

The most ambitious part of the sanitation program, though, was undoubtedly the effort to eradicate the mosquitoes <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/2236780.xml">
Aedes aegypti</link></it> and <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../071/542071.xml">
anopheles</link></it>, the carriers of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../254/34254.xml">
yellow fever</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/20423.xml">
malaria</link>, respectively, from the canal zone.  There was considerable resistance to this program at first, as the "mosquito theory" was still considered controversial and unproven.  However, with the support of chief engineer <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../761/475761.xml">
John Frank Stevens</link></person>
, who took over the post on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/15892.xml">
July 26</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../637/34637.xml">
1905</link>, Gorgas was finally able to put his ideas into action.</p>
<p>

Gorgas divided <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/22997.xml">
Panama</link></country>
 into 11 districts, and <link>
Col√≥n, Panama</link> into four. In each district, inspectors searched houses and buildings for mosquito larvae. If found, carpenters would be dispatched to the building, and work would be done to eliminate any objects or places where <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../526/5956526.xml">
stagnant water</link> could collect. </p>
<p>

Mosquitoes lay their eggs on the surface of standing water, and when their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../560/50560.xml">
larvae</link> hatch out, they live just below the surface, breathing by means of a siphon in their tails.  Hence, by eliminating standing water where possible, and by spreading oil upon the surface of any remaining pools, the larvae could be destroyed.</p>
<p>

Gorgas  organized a major program to drain and fill the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/86359.xml">
swamp</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/102024.xml">
wetland</link>s around the canal zone.  Many miles of ditches were dug, and grass and brush were cut back over wide areas.  Oiling was used in a variety of means; workers with spray tanks were sent to spray oil on standing pools, and smaller streams were tackled by placing a dripping oil can over the waterway, which created a film of oil over each still patch of water in the stream.  About 700,000 gallons of oil and 124,000 gallons of larvicide were used on the project per year.</p>
<p>

In addition to his draining program, Gorgas took another step in his efforts to eradicate mosquitoes in Panama: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../621/862621.xml">
fumigation</link>. Gorgas fumigated the residences of those Panamanians who had been confirmed to have contracted yellow fever. <it>"Pans of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../127/27127.xml">
sulphur</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/265892.xml">
pyrethrum</link> were then placed in the rooms, the right quantity of powder was weighed out (two pounds per thousand cubic feet), and the pans were sprinkled with wood-alcohol and set alight"</it> (Cameron 132). However, when the effectiveness of this procedure was realized, fumigation was extended to all of Panama. Within a year of Stevens's appointment, every single building in Panama had been fumigated (using up the entire United States supply of sulfur and pyrethrum). In 1906, only one case of yellow fever was reported, and up until the end of the Panama Canal's construction, there were zero.</p>

<p>

Gorgas's final means of attack upon disease was to quarantine those persons infected with yellow fever or malaria from the rest of the workforce.  Those who were diagnosed with either disease were quarantined and put into "Portable Fever Cages", easily transportable screened structures used to prevent mosquitoes from biting an infected person and carrying the disease to others.  Gorgas also had the thousands of workers on the Canal sleep in screened verandas, as the mosquitoes which spread malaria are nocturnal and would infect the most people at night.</p>

 The Outcome </st>

<p>

The first two and a half years of the American canal effort were substantially dedicated to preparation, much of it making the area fit for large-scale human habitation.  A very significant part of this was the sanitation program put in place by Gorgas.  Nearly $20 million was spent on health and sanitation during the ten years of the construction period.</p>
<p>

In the end, these efforts were a success: by 1906, yellow fever was virtually wiped out in the canal zone, and the number of deaths caused by the other top disease, malaria, was also reduced significantly.  The hospitals maintained were by far the best to be found anywhere in the tropics; some 32,000 patients were treated per year.</p>
<p>

Today, the canal zone is regarded as free of yellow fever and malaria, a great benefit to the many people who live and work there.
