 History </st>
<p>

The company began under the name "Melaleuca Oil" with the offering of a single product called "T36-C5 Melaleuca Oil" which was formulated from extract of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../039/59039.xml">
melaleuca</link> tree, commonly known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/646966.xml">
tea tree oil</link>.  A previous Melaleuca-based company by the name of "Oil of Melaleuca" operated as a standard <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/10447140.xml">
multi-level marketing</link> company whose literature made health claims the FDA would not approve.  The company sold products whose uses and benefits were not verifiably documented.  There were also exaggerated claims of the efficacy of the active ingredient, tea tree oil, and claims that the company was a sole source of the same, creating an impression of privileged access to a unique product.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  </p>

Melaleuca sales history from 1985 through 2006.

</image>
In 1985, the company was taken over by Frank L. VanderSloot who dissolved the previous company, created a new marketing plan to support consumers, immediately launched an initiative to bring the company's product line into compliance with FDA regulations, and started this new company under the name of "Melaleuca, Inc.".  He made the compensation plan more favorable to Marketing Executives, by establishing Consumer Direct Marketing. Independent Representatives were no longer required to sell products but instead became membership enrollment facilitators. Since VanderSloot has taken the helm, Melaleuca has experienced consistently increasing sales and revenues and expanded internationally.</p>

 Sales History </st>
<p>

Melaleuca was recognized by Inc Magazine as one of the fastest growing companies in the United States for five consecutive years (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../635/34635.xml">
1990</link>-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/18948337.xml">
1994</link>).  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  In addition, Melaleuca has seen 23 years of consecutive growth since its foundation in 1985.</p>
<p>

Though sales reached $850 Million in 2007, Melaleuca holds less than .5% of the North American marketplace, with their largest competitors being <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 Products and business model </st>
<p>

While initially based predominantly on  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/646966.xml">
melaleuca plant extracts</link>, the product line has since expanded beyond this initial focus.  Melaleuca sells products including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../514/92514.xml">
household cleaner</link>s, personal care items, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/180121.xml">
pharmaceutical</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/104444.xml">
nutritional supplements</link>. The company markets itself as being earth-friendly, and many of their products are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../765/412765.xml">
certified organic</link>.  They also launched a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/158015.xml">
cosmetics</link> line in partnership with fashion designer <couturier wordnetid="109972157" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 in January 2003.</p>
<p>

Melaleuca has been outspoken against the abuses inherent to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/10447140.xml">
multi-level marketing</link> and the damage they can cause.  By contrast, Melaleuca does not allow inventory loading (a practice used by many multi-level marketing companies encouraging them to purchase up to thousands of dollars worth of inventory), limits the marketing chain to 7 generations, and prohibits "breakaways" (another practice commonly found in multi-level marketing).  According to the company, another way it is less exploitive than  MLM's is that Melaleuca does not require its marketing executives to maintain an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../655/182655.xml">
inventory</link>. In order to receive commissions from one's customers, marketing executives must produce a minimal number of 35 product points per month (the equivalent of about $45-55 each month) to remain an active Marketing Executive. This in turn qualifies the customer to receive a 30-40% discount. The company also offers an opportunity to receive up to 15% of your monthly order back in "Advantage Awards" dollars. After receiving $20 in Advantage dollars the customer is allowed to redeem these dollars towards products. The products being purchased are everyday items such as shampoo, hairspray, and cleaning supplies. Distributors claim that the minimum required level is compatible with typical household or personal use.</p>
<p>

Melaleuca claims to focus on developing products that support a healthy lifestyle and are safer for the home. In the home, the company focuses on researching and bringing to market cleaning products that use more natural cleaning products that are claimed to be safer than "harsh chemicals."  Melaleuca touts that its products are as good or better than what is found at the local <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../196/239196.xml">
grocery store</link>, but without the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/12873937.xml">
bleach</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/212330.xml">
lye</link>, or other chemicals typically found in other brands. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

The company has developed an extensive line of nutritional products such as vitamin and mineral supplements which claim to promote heart health, cardiovascular, and blood pressure supplements, and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/792915.xml">
glucosamine</link> product for healthy joints.  They also have developed products using natural ingredients that the company claims support healthy vision, healthy prostate, healthy urinary tract, as well as other nutritional supplements.  It also has a body and bath product line, beauty and makeup line, and weight management line.</p>
<p>

The company uses a direct to consumer delivery model, where a customer can place an order via telephone or online (over the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
internet</link>) and products are delivered to the door via postal service or national mail carrier.</p>

 Nutritional Supplement Regulation </st>
<p>

Dietary Supplements are considered a food and are less regulated by the federal Food and Drug Administration.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Some doctors and pharmacies point out that some natural supplements may have an effect on prescription medications and someone taking strong prescription medications may want to consult their doctor before taking some nutritional supplements.  Additional information on herbal supplements and their uses and regulations can be found at the Wikipedia's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/439973.xml">
