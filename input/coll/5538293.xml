Sources of polyphenol antioxidants</st>
<p>

The main source of polyphenol antioxidants is nutritional, since they are found in a wide array of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../231/472231.xml">
phytonutrient</link>-bearing foods.  For example, most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../286/305286.xml">
legume</link>s; fruits such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/18978754.xml">

Biochemical regulation</st>
<p>

The regulation chemistry consists of a polyphenol antioxidantâ€™s ability to scavenge <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../028/235028.xml">
free radical</link>s  and up-regulate certain metal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/175641.xml">
chelation</link> reactions.  That is to say various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../697/640697.xml">
reactive oxygen species</link> must be continually removed from cells to maintain healthy metabolic function.  Some specific free radicals affected are the reactive oxygen species <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../647/1898647.xml">
singlet oxygen</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../425/3171425.xml">
peroxynitrite</link> and  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/14403.xml">
hydrogen peroxide</link>.  Diminishing the concentrations of reactive oxygen species can have several benefits.  Since reactive oxygen species are linked to mobilization of ion transport systems, they are known to have roles in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../362/4629362.xml">
redox signaling</link>. In particular, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/196121.xml">
platelets</link> involved in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../154/338154.xml">
wound</link> repair and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/3997.xml">
blood</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../980/13980.xml">
homeostasis</link> can release reactive oxygen species to recruit platelets to sites of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/515534.xml">
injury</link>. These also provide a link to the adaptive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/14958.xml">
immune system</link> via the recruitment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../480/144480.xml">
leukocytes</link>.  When polyphenols down-regulate reactive oxygen species formation, they also contribute to improved <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../570/532570.xml">

It is difficult to evaluate the medical effects of specific polyphenolic antioxidants, since such a large number of individual compounds may occur even in a single food.  For example, over sixty different chemically distinct flavonoids are known to occur in a given <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../961/32961.xml">
red wine</link>.  Numerous scientific studies have been conducted to attempt to arrive at one consistent index for food antioxidant power.  Since it has been proved that the dietary intake of compounds having antioxidant activity is medically  important, various chemical, biological, and electrochemical methods have been proposed to evaluate the antioxidant power of compounds such as polyphenols. Wine, although <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../854/529854.xml">
nonessential</link>, has a high polyphenol content up to two to three grams per liter in red wines obtained by traditional <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../948/1455948.xml">
maceration</link>. The polyphenol content of wines is usually evaluated by the <process wordnetid="105701363" confidence="0.8">

Statistical</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/82359.xml">

<p>

Other more detailed chemical research has been conducted elucidating the difficulty of isolating individual polyphenolic antioxidants.  Fajardo-Lirai et al. have demonstrated that significant variation in polyphenol content among various brands of tea can explain<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> the inconsistency in previous epidemiological studies that have tried to correlate beneficial health effects of polyphenol antioxidants using specific <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../676/262676.xml">

Practical aspects of dietary polyphenol antioxidants</st>

There is  debate regarding the total body absorption of dietary intake of polyphenolic compounds.  While individual studies seem to demonstrate the favourable health effects of certain specific polyphenols, more research is needed to understand the interactions between a variety of these chemicals acting in concert within the human body.  In particular there is evidence that some combinations of foods may inhibit efficient intestinal transfer of certain polyphenol antioxidants; refined sugars, for example, have been shown to impede this uptake under certain circumstances.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>  Furthermore caution should be exercised in attempting diets depending largely on dietary supplements as opposed to a broad array of food sources, since the quality and concentrations of beneficial chemicals in some commercial products is subject to question, given lack of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/11632.xml">
Food and Drug Administration</link> (FDA) regulation.</p>

Topical application of polyphenol antioxidants</st>

There is some data that reactive oxygen species play a role in the process of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/16413778.xml">
aging</link>. The skin is exposed to various <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/790775.xml">
exogenous</link> sources of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../549/2150549.xml">
oxidative stress</link>, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/31990.xml">
ultraviolet</link> radiation. These spectral components are generally viewed as responsible for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/2387330.xml">
extrinsic</link> type of skin aging, sometimes termed photo-aging. It has been shown not only that increased levels of protective low molecular weight antioxidants through a diet rich in phytochemicals, but also by direct topical dermal application<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref>  have proved that a few low <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../034/60034.xml">
