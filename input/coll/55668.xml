<p>

At first, when surface gold was plentiful, and many Americans were already there, the Chinese were mistreated and not well-received. As gold became harder to find and competition increased, animosity to the Chinese and other foreigners increased.  After being forcibly driven from the mines, most Chinese settled in enclaves in cities, mainly San Francisco, and took up low end wage labor such as restaurant work and laundry. With the post Civil War economy in decline by the 1870s, anti-Chinese animosity became politicized by labor leader <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9638700866880419">

The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese "skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

The Act also affected Chinese who were already in the United States. Any Chinese who left the United States had to obtain certifications for reentry, and the Act made Chinese immigrants permanent aliens by excluding them from U.S. citizenship.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  After the Act's passage, Chinese men in the U.S. had little chance of ever reuniting with their wives, or of starting families in their new home.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Amendments made in 1884 tightened the provisions that allowed previous immigrants to leave and return, and clarified that the law applied to ethnic Chinese regardless of their country of origin. The Act was renewed for ten years by the 1892 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/1134285.xml">
Geary Act</link>, and again with no terminal date in 1902.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>  The Act's 1902 extension also required "each Chinese resident to register and obtain a certificate of residence. Without a certificate, he or she faced deportation."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

One of the critics of the Chinese Exclusion Act was the anti-slavery/anti-imperialist Republican Senator <congressman wordnetid="109955781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../907/463907.xml">

 of <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/1645518.xml">
Massachusetts</link></country>
 who described the Act as "nothing less than the legalization of racial discrimination."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> </p>
<p>

The laws were driven largely by racial concerns; immigration of persons of other races was unlimited during this period.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> </p>
<p>

On the other hand, many people strongly supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, including the <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

For all practical purposes, the Exclusion Act, along with the restrictions that followed it, froze the Chinese community in place in 1882, and prevented it from growing and assimilating into U.S. society as European immigrant groups did.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> However, limited immigration from China did still occur until Angel Island Immigration Station on what is now <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../996/349996.xml">

 served as the processing center for most of the 56,113 Chinese immigrants who are recorded as immigrating or returning from China; upwards of 30%  more who showed up were returned to China. Furthermore, after the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../127/213127.xml">
1906 San Francisco earthquake</link>, which destroyed City Hall and the Hall of Records, many immigrants (known as "paper sons") falsely claimed familial ties to resident Chinese-American citizens which could not be disproved. </p>
<p>

Later, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/827359.xml">
Immigration Act of 1924</link> would restrict immigration even further, excluding all classes of Chinese trictions to other Asian immigrant groups.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Until these restrictions were relaxed in the middle of the twentieth century, Chinese immigrants were forced to live a life apart, and to build a society in which they could survive on their own.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Repeal and current status</st>
<p>

The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the 1943 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../299/1134299.xml">
Magnuson Act</link>, allowing a national quota of 105 Chinese immigrants per year, although large scale Chinese immigration did not occur until the passage of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../302/331302.xml">
Immigration Act of 1965</link>. Despite the fact that the exclusion act was repealed in 1943 the law in California that Chinese-Americans were not able to marry whites wasn't repealed until 1948.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> </p>
