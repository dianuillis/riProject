Many current <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/7878457.xml">

<p>

Most current real-world computer security efforts focus on external threats, and generally treat the computer system itself as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../888/55888.xml">
trusted system</link>.  
Some knowledgeable observers consider this to be a disastrous mistake, and point out that this distinction is the cause of much of the insecurity of current computer systems — once an attacker has subverted one part of a system without fine-grained security, he or she usually has access to most or all of the features of that system. 
Because computer systems can be very complex, and cannot be guaranteed to be free of <invertebrate wordnetid="101905661" confidence="0.8">

Financial cost</st>
<p>

Serious financial damage has been caused by computer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/7398.xml">
security breaches</link>, but reliably estimating costs is quite difficult.  Figures in the billions of dollars have been quoted in relation to the damage caused by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/20901.xml">
malware</link> such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/6010.xml">
computer worm</link>s like the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/174722.xml">
Code Red worm</link>, but such estimates may be exaggerated. However, other losses, such as those caused by the compromise of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../301/17182301.xml">
credit card</link> information, can be more easily determined, and they have been substantial, as measured by millions of individual victims of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/180609.xml">
identity theft</link> each year in each of several nations, and the severe hardship imposed on each victim, that can wipe out all of their finances, prevent them from getting a job, plus be treated as if <it>they</it> were the criminal.  Volumes of victims of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/428364.xml">
phishing</link> and other scams may not be known.</p>
<p>

Individuals who have been infected with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/28951.xml">
spyware</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/20901.xml">
malware</link> likely go through a costly and time-consuming process of having their computer cleaned.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/28951.xml">
Spyware</link> is considered to be a problem specific to the various Microsoft Windows operating systems, however this can be partially explained by the fact that Microsoft controls a major share of the PC market and thus represent the most prominent target.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Reasons</st>
<p>

There are many similarities (yet many fundamental differences) between computer and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../725/58725.xml">
physical security</link>.
Just like real-world security, the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers, sometimes called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/2471540.xml">
hackers</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/29213.xml">
cracker</link>s.  Some are  teenage thrill-seekers or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../676/32676.xml">
vandal</link>s (the kind often responsible for defacing web sites); similarly, some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/3230839.xml">
web site defacement</link>s are done to make political statements.  However, some attackers are highly skilled and motivated with the goal of compromising computers for financial gain or espionage. An example of the latter is <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

, about his experiences. For those seeking to prevent security breaches, the first step is usually to attempt to identify what might motivate an attack on the system, how much the continued operation and information security of the system are worth, and who might be motivated to breach it.  The precautions required for a home <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/18457137.xml">

network</link>. Other computer security writers suggest that, since an attacker using a network need know nothing about you or what you have on your computer, attacker motivation is inherently impossible to determine beyond guessing. If true, blocking all possible attacks is the only plausible action to take.</p>

Vulnerabilities</st>
<p>

To understand the techniques for securing a computer system, it is important to first understand the various types of "attacks" that can be made against it.  These threats can typically be classified into one of these seven categories:</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Exploits</st>
<p>

An exploit (from the same word in the French language, meaning "achievement", or "accomplishment") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence of commands that take advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). This frequently includes such things as gaining control of a computer system or allowing privilege escalation or a denial of service attack. Many development methodologies rely on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/29090.xml">
testing</link> to ensure the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/1301906.xml">
quality</link> of any code released; this process often fails to discover extremely unusual potential exploits.
The term "exploit" generally refers to small programs designed to take advantage of a software flaw that has been discovered, either remote or local. The code from the exploit program is frequently reused in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../056/30056.xml">
trojan horse</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../196/18994196.xml">
computer virus</link>es. In some cases, a
vulnerability can lie in certain programs' processing of a specific file type, such as a non-executable media file. Some security web sites maintain lists of currently known unpatched vulnerabilities found in common programs (see "External links" below).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Eavesdropping</st>
<p>

Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation. Even machines that operate as a closed system (ie, with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../532/9532.xml">
electro-magnetic</link> transmissions generated by the hardware such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../781/184781.xml">
TEMPEST</link>. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../127/11127.xml">
FBI</link>'s proposed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/1079134.xml">
Carnivore program</link> was intended to act as a system of eavesdropping protocols built into the systems of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
internet service providers</link>.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Social engineering and human error</st>
<p>

A computer system is no more secure than the human systems responsible for its operation. Malicious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../593/14593.xml">
individual</link>s have regularly penetrated well-designed, secure computer systems by taking advantage of the carelessness of trusted individuals, or by deliberately deceiving them, for example sending messages that they are the system administrator and asking for passwords. This deception is known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../243/730243.xml">
Social engineering</link>.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Denial of service attacks</st>
<p>

Unlike other exploits, denial of service attacks are not used to gain unauthorized access or control of a system.  They are instead designed to render it unusable.  Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately guessing a wrong password 3 consecutive times and thus causing the victim account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once.  These types of attack are, in practice, very hard to prevent, because the behavior of whole <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/4122592.xml">
networks</link> needs to be analyzed, not only the behaviour of small pieces of code. <link>
Distributed denial of service</link> (DDoS) attacks are common, where a large number of compromised hosts (commonly referred to as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/531566.xml">
zombie computer</link>s", used as part of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../268/636268.xml">
botnet</link> with, for example; a <link>
worm</link>, <link>
trojan horse</link>, or <link>
backdoor exploit</link> to control them.) are used to flood a target system with network requests, thus attempting to render it unusable through resource exhaustion.  Another technique to exhaust victim resources is through the use of an attack amplifier — where the attacker takes advantage of poorly designed protocols on 3rd party machines, such as FTP or DNS, in order to instruct these hosts to launch the flood.
There are also commonly vulnerabilities in applications that cannot be used to take control over a computer, but merely make the target application malfunction or crash.  This is known as a denial-of-service exploit.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Indirect attacks</st>
<p>

An indirect attack is an attack launched by a third party computer. By using someone else's computer to launch an attack, it becomes far more difficult to track down the actual attacker. There have also been cases where attackers took advantage of public anonymizing systems, such as the <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/18582150.xml">
tor onion router</link></software>
 system.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Backdoors</st>
<p>

A backdoor in a computer system (or cryptosystem or algorithm) is a method of bypassing normal authentication, securing remote access to a computer, obtaining access to plaintext, and so on, while attempting to remain undetected. The backdoor may take the form of an installed program (e.g., Back Orifice), or could be a modification to an existing program or hardware device.
A specific form of backdoors are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/223942.xml">
rootkits</link>, which replaces system
binaries and/or hooks into the function calls of the operating system to hide the presence of other programs, users, services and open ports. It may also fake information about disk and memory usage.</p>

Direct access attacks</st>
<p>

Someone who has gained access to your computer can install any type of devices to compromise security, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> modifications, software worms, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../829/57829.xml">
key loggers</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/87235.xml">
covert listening device</link>s. The attacker can also easily download large quantities of data onto backup media, for instance <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../780/6780.xml">
CD-R</link>/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../034/407034.xml">
DVD-R</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../109/31109.xml">

digital camera</link>s or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/1247424.xml">
digital audio player</link>s. Another common technique is to boot an operating system contained on a <recording wordnetid="104063868" confidence="0.8">

<st>
Reducing vulnerabilities</st>

<p>

Computer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../661/27661.xml">
code</link> is regarded by some as just a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/18831.xml">
mathematics</link>. It is theoretically possible to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../285/82285.xml">
prove</link> the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../339/357339.xml">
correctness</link> of computer programs though the likelihood of actually achieving this in large-scale practical systems is regarded as unlikely in the extreme by some with practical experience in the industry — see <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../732/36732.xml">
Bruce Schneier</link></person>
 et al.</p>
<p>

It's also possible to protect messages in transit (ie, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/5177.xml">
communication</link>s) by means of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/18934432.xml">
cryptography</link>.  One method of encryption — the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../210/22210.xml">
one-time pad</link> — is unbreakable when correctly used. This method was used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, though flaws in their implementation allowed some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../715/5715.xml">
cryptanalysis</link> (See <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../620/173620.xml">
Venona Project</link>). The method uses a matching pair of key-codes, securely distributed, which are used once-and-only-once to encode and decode a single message.  For transmitted computer encryption this method is difficult to use properly (securely), and highly inconvenient as well.  Other methods of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/10294.xml">
encryption</link>, while breakable in theory, are often virtually impossible to directly break by any means publicly known today.  Breaking them requires some non-cryptographic input, such as a stolen key, stolen plaintext (at either end of the transmission), or some other extra cryptanalytic information. </p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../243/730243.xml">
Social engineering</link> and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information.  Even in a highly disciplined environment, such as in military organizations, social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.</p>
<p>

In practice, only a small fraction of computer program code is mathematically proven, or even goes through comprehensive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../471/1724471.xml">
information technology audit</link>s or inexpensive but extremely valuable <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../788/2186788.xml">
computer security audit</link>s, so it's usually possible for a determined cracker to read, copy, alter or destroy data in well secured computers, albeit at the cost of great time and resources. Extremely few, if any, attackers would audit applications for vulnerabilities just to attack a single specific system. You can reduce a cracker's chances by keeping your systems up to date, using a <link>
security scanner</link> or/and hiring competent people responsible for security. The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced
by careful <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/533867.xml">
backing up</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/15176.xml">

legal</link> authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.</entry>

Today, computer security comprises mainly "preventive" measures, like firewalls or an <link>
Exit Procedure</link>. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>, and is normally implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../882/23882.xml">
network stack</link> (or, in the case of most <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/31642.xml">
UNIX</link>-based operating systems such as <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/6097297.xml">
Linux</link></O>
, built into the operating system <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../394/50394.xml">
kernel</link>) to provide realtime filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../748/25748.xml">
physical firewall</link> which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> (though not universal, as demonstrated by the large numbers of machines "cracked" by worms like the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/174722.xml">
Code Red worm</link> which would have been protected by a properly-configured firewall).  However, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organised response mechanisms in place.</p>

Difficulty with response</st>
<p>

Responding forcefully to attempted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/7398.xml">
security breaches</link> (in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches) is often very difficult for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Identifying attackers is difficult, as they are often in a different <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../392/16392.xml">
jurisdiction</link> to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymising procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in yet another jurisdiction.  If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete <system wordnetid="104377057" confidence="0.8">

 The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/53259.xml">
cable modem</link>) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated vulnerability scanners and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/6010.xml">
computer worms</link>.</entry>

s are often unfamiliar with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../340/15340.xml">
information technology</link>, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers.  There are also budgetary constraints.  It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../955/7955.xml">
DNA</link> testing, and improved <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../710/45710.xml">
forensics</link> mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/1595155.xml">
network administrator</link> or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/154985.xml">
system administrator</link>) requires a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/146745.xml">
search warrant</link> and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.</entry>
