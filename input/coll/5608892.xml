CHS accepts the top ranking student from each school district. After the 1st round, all left over positions go to the highest scoring applicants from all applicants. There are, generally, no more acceptances after this, as there is overenrollment in anticipation that some students will not accept the invitation.</p>

The Class of 2013 hopeful's information sessions are comping up in October/November.</p>

Classes operate on block scheduling. Each day is divided into 4 class periods and a lunch/activity period. The classes run for 85 minutes each. The lunch/activity period is placed between periods 2 and 3, and lasts for approximately 1 hour. Students eat lunch and participate in school clubs during that time period.  </p>
<p>

The school year is divided into two semesters. Students will attend a 5 credit class 5 times a week for one semester. Classes worth 2.5 credits will be attended every day for half the semester and then swapped with another class; classes worth 2.5 credits are rarely given every other day. Students who pass every class will acquire 40 credits each school year. Students must have 160 credits in order to graduate. However, the state of New Jersey only requires 120 credits to graduate from high school.</p>
<p>

CHS requires that students explore many options during their first two years at the school. The only language offered at CHS is Spanish, and students must take at least 3 courses of the language. Students are required to take 4 years of Math, English, History, and Science. Gym and Health classes are required every year, but seniors must fulfill class requirements outside of the school setting.</p>
