The Mycenaean civilization flourished  between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../686/42686.xml">
1600 BC</link> and ca. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/44146.xml">
1100 BC</link>, with the collapse of their Bronze-Age civilization. The collapse is commonly attributed to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../378/620378.xml">
Dorian invasion</link>, although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. The major Mycenaean cites were Mycenae and Tiryns in Argolis, Pylos in Messenia, Athens in Attica, <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

No priestly class has yet been identified. Worshiper and worshiped are identified in seals, rings and votive figures through their gestures: worshipers fold their arms, or raise the right arm in greeting, or place a hand on the forehead. Deities lift both arms in the "epiphany gesture" or reach forward to give or receive. The pantheon of Mycenaean deities has been reassembled from inscriptions in Linear B found at Pylos and at post-palatial Mycenaean Knossos in Crete. Some of the deities are familiar — or at least their names are recognizably present in the Olympic pantheon of written myth. Others are not: Ares, for example, is represented only as "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../003/81003.xml">
Enyalios</link>" which was retained as an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/514444.xml">

 intervention, and have in some cases been reduced to decorative formulas, embodying themes appropriate to their locations: lions and wingless griffins in audience chambers, processional figures in corridors, etc. In a change from the Minoan delight in the life of animals, the Mycenaean relation to nature is reflected in their depictions of animals which are shown only in relation to man or as victims of the hunt.

Historical summary</st>
<p>

From a chronological perspective, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/1748869.xml">
Late Helladic</link> (1550-1060 BC), is the time when Mycenaean Greece flourished, under new influences from Minoan Crete and the Cyclades. Those who made LH pottery sometimes inscribed their work with a syllabic script recognizable as <W wordnetid="106833544" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/18551.xml">

. LH is divided into I, II, and III; of which I and II overlap <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../327/73327.xml">
Late Minoan</link> ware and III overtakes it. LH III is further subdivided into IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.</p>
<p>

LH pottery typically stored such goods as olive oil and wine. LHI ware had reached <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../144/1025144.xml">
Santorini</link> just before the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../801/4217801.xml">
Thera eruption</link>. LHIIB began during LMIB, and has been found in Egypt during the reign of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/155730.xml">
Tuthmosis III</link>. LHIIB spanned the LMIB/LMII destruction on Crete which is associated with the Greek takeover of the island.</p>
<p>

LHIIIA:1 corresponds with the reign of Amenhotep III, who recorded as part of <it>tj-n3-jj</it> the apparently-equal cities <it>d-y-q-e-i-s</it> (*Thegwas, Thebes) and <it>m-w-k-i-n-u</it> (*Mukana, Mycenae). LHIIIA:1 also corresponds with the time of Attarsiya the Man of Ahhiya, who alternately attacked and aided the rebel <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../261/3092261.xml">
Madduwatta</link> of Zippasla.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> LHIIIA:1-period <it>tj-n3-jj</it> / "Ahhiya" (and for that matter LHIIIA:1 Greece) did not feature otherwise in the calculus of the great kings of the Bronze Age, and certainly not as a coherent state.</p>
<p>

("Ahhiya" and its LHIIIA:2-B derivative, "Ahhiyawa", can be linked to Greece only indirectly. The Hittites did not use any term approximating <it>tj-n3-jj</it>; and they did not link "Ahhiya[wa]" to *Thegwas, *Mukana, or any other projected LBA names of known Greek cities. Also, no "Attarsiyas layer" of LHIIIA:1 has yet been found in western Anatolia. Still, Ahhiya must refer to a powerful people off the coast of Miletus, and Greece is the best available option at this time.)</p>

<p>

During the LHIIIA:2 period, kings of "Ahhiyawa" began to arise to the attention of the Hittites and possibly as rulers of the "Achaean" states. In LHIIIB, they rose almost to the status of the Great Kings in Egypt and Assyria. LHIIIB is also the period of Linear B script at the mainland palaces; prior to then, Linear B was in use primarily in the Cyclades and Crete.</p>

Since the decipherment of the Linear B tablets, it has been known that the people incorrectly called <it>Mycenaeans</it> were Greeks.

</it>, and taking into account mention of the <it>Ahhiyawa</it> in Hittite sources from the Late Bronze Age, the theory suggests itself that the Mycenaeans should be given the name <it>Achaeans</it>. But the second argument is far from being widely accepted, and, as for the first, the term <it>Achaean</it> can have several meanings in Homer's writings.</p>

Mycenaean world</st>
<p>

In the absence of direct sources, the general political organization of the Mycenaean world cannot be known with certainty. Having reference to Homer, it would seem that Greece was divided into several states, the cities of the <it>Iliad</it>: Mycenae, Pylos, Orchomenos which are known to archeology, and also perhaps Sparta or Ithaca, but archeology has been unable to confirm this. Only the states of Pylos and Knossos are clearly attested in the Linear B texts. Even so, it is impossible to know which was the dominant political center in Argolis, if there indeed was one: Mycenae, Tiryns, or Argos?

Mention of a <it>King of the Ahhiyawa</it> in Hittite sources has been connected with the <it>King of the Achaeans</it>, the Mycenaean king Agamemnon of the <it>Iliad</it>, but there is nothing to prove that these Ahhiyawa were in reality the Achaeans (though that is the most logical interpretation), and the location of their kingdom remains a matter for debate: Asia Minor, Rhodes, mainland Greece? Although some researchers, basing their theories upon Hittite and Homeric sources, would like to make of the Mycenaean Greeks a confederation of states ruled by a king, <it>primus inter pares</it>, as yet this cannot be confirmed.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
States of Pylos and Knossos</st>
<p>

On a smaller scale, information about the internal organization of the best-known kingdoms, Pylos and Knossos, can be gleaned from sources in Linear B. But, here again, nothing is certain.</p>
<p>

The state appears to have been ruled by a king, the <it>wa-na-ka</it> (ϝάναξ / <it>wánax</it>), whose role was no doubt military, judicial, and religious. He is identifiable in the Homeric <it>anax</it> (ἄναξ) ("divine lord, sovereign, host"). Nine occurrences of the word appear in texts having to do with offerings, which suggests that the sovereigns of Pylos and Knossos were worshiped. However, in Homer the word can also designate a deity.</p>
<p>

The king was assisted by the <it>ra-wa-ke-ta</it> (<it>lawagetas</it>), no doubt the leader of the army. He and the king each possessed a landed estate, the <it>te-me-no</it> (τέμενος / <it>témenos</it>). Other dignitaries were the <it>te-re-ta</it> (<it>telestai</it>), who appear in the texts as landowners. They perhaps exercised a religious function. The <it>e-qe-ta</it> (<it>equetai</it>), literally, <it>the companions</it> (<it>the knights</it>), formed the entourage of the king. These were the warriors.</p>
<p>

Besides the members of the court, there were other dignitaries in charge of local territorial administration. The kingdom of Pylos was divided into two great provinces, the <it>de-we-ra ka-ra-i-ja</it>, the near province, and the <it>pe-ra-ko-ra-i-ja</it>, the far province, around the town of <it>re-u-ko-to-ro</it>. The kingdom was further subdivided into seven districts, then into a number of communes. To manage these districts, the king named a <it>ko-re-te</it> (<it>koreter</it>, <it>governor</it>) and a <it>po-ro-ko-re-te</it> (<it>prokoreter</it>, <it>vice governor</it>). A <it>da-mo-ko-ro</it> (<it>damokoros</it>, <it>one who takes care of a damos</it>), in charge of the commune, the <it>da-mo</it> (literally, <it>people</it>, cf. δῆμος / <it>dễmos</it>), and a <it>qa-si-re-u</it> (cf. βασιλεύς / <it>basileús</it>) shared responsibility at the communal level. Their roles are not precisely known; it seems they chaired a council of elders, the <it>ke-ro-si-ja</it> (cf. γερουσία / <it>gerousía</it>). It is, incidentally, interesting to note that in Classical Greece, the <it>basileus</it> is the king, the monarch, as if between the disintegration of Mycenaean society and the Classical Age no higher authority survived — <it>de facto</it>, and then, over the generations, <it>de jure</it> — than the communal official.</p>

</ss1>
</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Society</st>
<p>

Mycenaean society appears to have been divided into two groups of free men: the king's entourage, who conducted administrative duties at the palace, and the people, <it>da-mo</it> (<it>demos</it>), who lived at the commune level. As has been described above, these last were watched over by royal agents; the people were obliged to perform duties for and pay taxes to the palace.</p>
<p>

Among those who evolved in the palace setting could be found well-to-do high officials who probably lived in the vast residences found in proximity to Mycenaean palaces, but also others, tied by their work to the palace and not necessarily better off than the members of the <it>da-mo</it>: craftsmen, farmers, and perhaps merchants, to name a few. On a lower rung of the social ladder were found the slaves, <it>do-e-ro</it> (masculine) and <it>do-e-ra</it> (feminine) (cf. δούλος / <it>doúlos</it>). These are recorded in the texts as working either for the palace or for specific deities.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Mycenaean contacts</st>
<p>

By the close of the Bronze Age (up to Late Helladic IIIC) contacts between the Aegean and its neighbours were well established. The circulation of goods and produce between centres are attested in Linear B records, though evidence of direct exchange is not. Evidence of Mycenaean cultural contacts with other societies of the era are demonstrated by the recovery of fresco fragments and relief painting at Avaris in the Nile Delta, whilst, at the settlement of Milawatta (modern Miletus), high-quality Palace style and Mycenaean ceramics have been recovered.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Economy</st>
<p>

The economic organization of the Mycenaean kingdoms known from the texts seems to have been bipartite: a first group worked in the orbit of the palace, while another was self-employed. This reflects the societal structure seen above. But there was nothing to prevent a person working for the palace from running his own business.</p>
<p>

The economy was supervised by scribes, who made note of incoming and outgoing products, assigned work, and were in charge of the distribution of rations. The <it>du-ma-te</it> seems to have been a sort of supervising quartermaster.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Agriculture</st>
<p>

The territory of the Mycenaean kingdoms of Pylos and Knossos was divided into two parts: the <it>ki-ti-me-na</it>, the palace land, and the <it>ke-ke-me-na</it>, the communal land, cultivated by those the texts call <it>ka-ma-na-e-we</it>, undoubtedly the <it>da-mo</it>. The palace lands are those attested in the texts. One part makes up the <it>te-me-no</it> of the <it>wa-ka-na</it> and of the <it>ra-wa-ge-ta</it>, as seen above. The other part was granted as a perquisite to members of the palace administration. These lands might be worked by slaves or by free men to whom the land had been leased.</p>
<p>

Agricultural production in these kingdoms was along the lines of the traditional "Mediterranean trilogy": grain, olives, and grapes. The grains cultivated were <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../858/36858.xml">

Livestock consisted primarily of sheep and goats. Cows and pigs were less common because of their unwholesome aroma. Horses were kept chiefly for the pulling of chariots in battle.</p>

Industry</st>
<p>

The organization of artisanal labor is especially well known in the case of the palace. The archives of Pylos show a specialized workforce, each worker belonging to a precise category and assigned to a specific place in the stages of production, notably in textiles.</p>
<p>

The textile industry was one of the principal sectors of the Mycenaean economy. The tablets of Knossos reveal the entire chain of production, from the flocks of sheep to the stocking of the palace storerooms with the finished product, through the shearing and the sorting of the wool in the workshops, as well as working conditions in those workshops. The palace of Pylos employed around 550 textile workers. At Knossos there were some 900. Fifteen different textile specialties have been identified. Next to wool, flax was the fiber most used.</p>
<p>

The metallurgical industry is well attested at Pylos, where 400 workers were employed. It is known from the sources that metal was distributed to them such that they might carry out the required work: on average, 3.5 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/16619.xml">
kilogram</link>s (7.7 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../316/23316.xml">
lb</link>) of bronze per smith. On the other hand, it is not known how they were paid — they are mysteriously absent in the ration distribution lists. At Knossos, several tablets testify to the making of swords, but with no mention of the true industry of metallurgy.</p>
<p>

The industry of perfumery is attested as well. Tablets describe the making of perfumed oil using rose, sage, etc.  It is known, too, from the archaeology that the workers attached to the palace included other kinds of artisans: goldsmiths, ivory-carvers, stonecarvers, and potters, for example. Olive oil was also made there. Certain areas of endeavor were turned toward export.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Commerce</st>
<p>

Commerce remains curiously absent from the written sources. Thus, once the perfumed oil of Pylos has been stored in its little jars, no one knows what became of it. Large stirrup jars that once contained oil have been found at Thebes, in Boeotia. They carry inscriptions in Linear B indicating their place of origin, western Crete. However, Cretan tablets breathe not a word about the exportation of oil. There is little information about the distribution route of textiles. It is known that the Minoans exported fine fabrics to Egypt; the Mycenaeans no doubt did the same. Indeed, it is probable that they borrowed knowledge of navigational matters from the Minoans, as is evidenced by the fact that their maritime commerce did not take off until after the founding of the Minoan civilization. Despite the lack of sources, it is probable that certain products, notably fabrics and oil, even metallurgical objects, were meant to be sold outside the kingdom, for they were made in quantities too great to be consumed solely at home.</p>
<p>

Archaeology can, however, shed some light on the matter of the exportation of Mycenaean products outside of Greece. A number of vases have been found in the Aegean, in <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

The nodule displayed the imprint of a seal and an ideogram representing the object. Other information was sometimes added: quality, origin, destination, etc.</p>
<p>

Fifty-six nodules found at Thebes in 1982 carry an ideogram representing an ox. Thanks to them, the itinerary of these bovines can be reconstructed. From all over Boeotia, even from Euboea, they were taken to Thebes to be sacrificed. The nodules served to prove that they were not stolen animals and to prove their origin. Once the animals arrived at their destination, the nodules were removed and gathered to create a book-keeping tablet. The nodules were used for all sorts of objects and explain how Mycenaean book-keeping could have been so rigorous. The scribe did not have to count the objects themselves, he could base his tables upon the nodules.</p>

The religious element is difficult to identify in Mycenaean civilization, especially as regards archaeological sites, where it remains problematic to pick out a place of worship with certainty. As for the texts, only a few lists of offerings give names of gods, and they teach us nothing about religious practices. The Mycenaean pantheon already included numerous divinities that can be found in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../957/11936957.xml">

No great temple has been identified for the Mycenaean epoch. Certain buildings found in citadels having a central room of oblong shape surrounded by small rooms may have served as places of worship. Aside from that, the existence of a domestic cult may be supposed. Some shrines have been located, as at Phylakopi, where have been found a considerable number of statuettes undoubtedly fashioned to serve as offerings, and it can be supposed that sites such as Delphi, Dodona, Delos, and Eleusis were already important shrines. However, this remains difficult to prove.</p>

 Fortresses </st>
<p>

The principal Mycenaean towns were well fortified. The town could be situated on an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../536/1536.xml">
acropolis</link> as in Athens or Tiryns, against a large hill as in Mycenae, or on the seaside, like Gla or Pylos. Besides the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/6695.xml">
citadel</link>s, there are also isolated forts that undoubtedly served to militarily control territory. Mycenaean walls were often made in a fashion called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/2094245.xml">
<it>cyclopean''</it></link>, which means that they were constructed of large, unworked boulders up to eight meters (26 ft) thick, loosely fitted without the clay mortar of the day. Different types of entrances or exits can be seen: monumental gates, access ramps, hidden doors, and vaulted galleries for escaping in case of a siege. Fear of attack meant that the chosen site must have a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../082/1262082.xml">
cistern</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/15105978.xml">
well</link> at its disposal.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Habitations </st>
<p>

The Mycenaean sites are composed of different types of residences. The smallest are rectangular in form and measure between 5 and 20 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../947/18947.xml">
metre</link>s (16–66&nbsp;ft) on a side. These were the houses of the lowest classes. They could have one or several rooms; the latter become more widespread in more recent periods. On a more developed level are found larger residences, measuring about 20 to 35 meters (66 to 115&nbsp;ft) on a side, made up of many rooms and central courtyards. Their layout resembles that of a palace. It is not, however, certain that these were indeed the residences of the Mycenaean aristocrats; another theory is that they were palace annexes, being often situated next to them.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Palaces</st>
<p>

The best examples of the Mycenaean palace are seen in the excavations at Mycenae, Tyrins and Pylos. These were administrative centers for the Mycenaean state, as is shown by the records found there. From an architectural point of view, they were the heirs of the Minoan palaces and also of other palaces built on the Greek mainland during the Middle Age. They were arranged around a group of courtyards each opening upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters. The heart of the palace was the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/2089534.xml">
megaron</link>. This was the throne room, laid out around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns, the throne generally being found on the right-hand side upon entering the room. The staircases found in the palace of Pylos indicate palaces had had two stories. Located on the top floor were probably the private quarters of the royal family and some storerooms. These palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and frescoes.</p>

Vessels</st>
<p>

Archaeologists have found a great quantity of pottery from the Mycenaean age, of widely diverse styles—stirrup jars, pitchers, kraters, chalices sometimes called "champagne coupes" after their shape, etc. The vessels vary in size. Their conformations remained quite consistent throughout the Mycenaean period, up through LHIIIB, when production increased considerably, notably in Argolis whence came great numbers exported outside Greece. The products destined for export were generally more luxurious and featured heavily worked painted decorations incorporating mythic, warrior, or animal motifs. Another type of vessel, in metal (normally bronze), has been found in sizeable quantities at Mycenaean sites. The forms of these were rather tripods, basins, or lamps. A few examples of vessels in faieance and ivory are also known. Mycenaeans made a great deal of pottery.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Statuary</st>
<p>

The Mycenaean period has not yielded statuary of any great size. The statuary of the period consists for the most part of delicate terra cotta statuettes, found mostly at the Phylokopi site, but also at Mycenae, Tirynth, and Asine. The majority of these statuettes are anthropomorphic figurines (but there are also some zoomorphic), male and female. They display various postures: arms outstretched, raised to the sky; hands on hips; seated. They are painted, monochrome or polychrome. Their purpose is uncertain, but it seems quite probable that they were votive objects, having been found in the context of what appear to have been places of worship.</p>

The painting of the Mycenaean age was much influenced by that of the Minoan age. Several frescoes have been found in Mycenaean palaces. Various themes are represented: the hunt (tauromachy), battle, processions, mythological narrative. Other frescoes are made up of geometric motifs. Some pottery was also painted (see above) with identical themes.</p>

Military items have been found among the treasures of the Mycenaean age. The most impressive work is that of the Dendra panoply,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> a complete suit of Mycenaean armor. The cuirass is made up of bronze plates sewn to a leather garment. The weight of this armor must have hindered the mobility of a warrior, and it is for this reason it is supposed that it was worn by a warrior riding in a chariot. The defensive armament found at Mycenaean sites consists of several helmets,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> particularly an example in the shape of a wild boar's head, which is absent in the last stages of the Late Helladic.

They were made of wood and leather.</p>
<p>

Offensive arms were made of bronze. Spears and javelins have been found, and also an assortment of swords of different sizes,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> designed for striking with the point and with the edge.

Funerary practices</st>
<p>

The usual form of burial in the Late Helladic was inhumation. The dead were buried beneath their own houses or outside the residential zones in cemeteries, sometimes in a tumulus (θόλος / <it>thólos</it>). This form dates back to the oldest periods of Indo-European settlement in Greece, and its roots are to be found in the Balkan cultures of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/35942.xml">
third millennium BC</link>, and even the Kurgan culture. Individual tombs were in the form of a cist, with a stone facing. Grave goods appear in LH I, whereas they were absent in preceding periods. Beginning also in the Late Helladic are to be seen communal tombs of rectangular form. It is difficult to establish whether the different forms of burial represent a social hierarchization, as was formerly thought, with the <it>tholois</it> being the tombs of the elite rulers, the individual tombs those of the leisure class, and the communal tombs those of the people. Cremations increased in number over the course of the period, becoming quite numerous in LH III C. This is perhaps proof of the arrival of a new population in Greece. The most impressive tombs of the Mycenaean era are the monumental royal tombs of Mycenae, undoubtedly intended for the royal family of the city. The most famous is the Tomb of Agamemnon (the Treasure of Atreus), which is in the form of a <it>tholos</it>. Nearby are other tombs (known as "Circle A"), called those of Clytemnestra and Aigisthos. All contained impressive treasures, exhumed by Schliemann during the excavation of Mycenae.</p>

Destruction</st>
<p>

The end of the Mycenaean period poses an array of questions that have yet to be answered, as much from the point of view of the chronology as of the interpretation of events.</p>
<p>

The end of LH III B1 was marked by some destruction, in particular at Mycenae. By LH III B2, an augmentation of the Mycenaean systems of defense can be seen, a sign of increasing insecurity. But this does not seem to have been a period of crisis, because these levels have yielded archaeological material that bespeaks a degree of wealth in no way inferior to that of previous periods. The end of this period is nevertheless marked by a number of destructions in the greater part of the Mycenaean sites on mainland Greece.</p>
<p>

LH III C saw a decrease in the number of sites in Greece, which might have been considerable in certain regions (nine-tenths of the sites in Boeotia disappeared, and two-thirds in Argolis). Yet certain sites such as Mycenae and Tirynth continued to be inhabited, and the material culture found there continues to exhibit Mycenaean traits, such that LH III C is considered to be a level of Mycenaean civilization. However, a new type of ceramic appeared, called "barbarian" because it was formerly attributed to foreign invaders, and there was also a continuing increase in the practice of cremation.</p>
<p>

What were the causes of the decline of Mycenaean civilization in this period? Several explanations have been advanced. Those concerning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/5823212.xml#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Nature+and+causes+of+destruction%22])">
natural factors</link> (climate change, earthquakes) are considered more controversial. The two most common theories are: population movement and internal conflict. The first attributes the destruction of Mycenaean sites to invaders. Sometimes the Dorians are invoked, sometimes the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/324954.xml">
Sea People</link>. It is now known that the first had been present in Greece all along, so it is difficult to accept the old theory that a "Dorian invasion" cut down the civilization of the Mycenaeans.</p>
<p>

The movements of people occurring from the Balkans to the Middle East at this period, mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions calling the invaders by the name of the "Sea People", are quite real. It is known that these people were responsible for numerous destructions in Anatolia and the Levant. Mention of a people called <it>Eqwesh</it> (which recalls the term <it>Achaean</it>) in an Egyptian text of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../202/40202.xml">
12th century BC</link> has caused specialists to suppose that the Mycenaeans had taken part in these invasions (this is not certain). There is little else to tell us what happened in the Greek world.</p>
<p>

There is the second theory, which has the Mycenaean civilization falling in the course of internal societal conflicts brought on by a rejection of the palatial system by the most underprivileged strata of society, who were impoverished at the end of the Late Helladic. This hypothesis is sometimes joined with the preceding one, mingling social divisions with ethnic divisions.</p>
<p>

In this context it has to be stressed, that the beginning <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/14711.xml">
Iron Age</link> made large numbers of comparatively cheap weapons accessible. An economic factor, that is also seen as a root cause of the apparition of the "sea peoples" in Egypt and the destruction of <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../595/203595.xml">
Ugarit</link></village>
 and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/2893534.xml">
Hittite Empire</link>.</p>
<p>

Whatever were the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after LH III C, when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurs after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../857/34857.xml">
