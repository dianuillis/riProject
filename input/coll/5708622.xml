The <b>Wilson Fuel Company Limited</b>, often shortened to <b>Wilson Fuel</b>, is an independent petroleum wholesaler, distributor and retailer headquartered in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

History</st>
<p>

Wilson Fuel traces its history to a mercantile trade company founded in Truro during the early 1800s.  It branched out into construction in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../786/155786.xml">

 during the early 1900s and was involved in some of the reconstruction efforts in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 following the <attack wordnetid="100972621" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/184399.xml">

.  It was also a general contractor for many of Nova Scotia's historic buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The company gradually left the construction industry and began to supply coal to Truro's residential and commercial customers for heating from a coal yard alongside the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/260799.xml">
Canadian National Railways</link> main line at Pleasant Street. The company adopted its present name of Wilson Fuel Company Limited during the 1950s when fuel oil replaced coal.</p>
<p>

The company expanded its residential and commercial fuel oil distribution and wholesale business through the 1960s-2000s and branched out into the retail petroleum business during the 1990s.  The company maintains its headquarters on the original retail coal yard in Truro.</p>
<p>

The retail petroleum subsidiary of Wilson Fuel is called <b>Wilsons Gas Stops</b> (note the plural on Wilson).  Wilsons Gas Stops owns and operates 32 company service stations; 9 are branded <b>Wilsons Gas Stops</b> and 23 stations are branded <b>Esso</b> (in partnership with Wilsons' petroleum supplier <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../292/657292.xml">
Imperial Oil</link></company>
).  The company also distributes gasoline to 271 independent retail stations throughout Atlantic Canada.  Some company owned and operated stations have convenience stores and fast food outlets.  The home heating fuel division also sells propane through Wilson Fuel subsidiary <b>Action Propane</b>, as well as other products.</p>
<p>

The company's president is Ian Alexander Wilson.  Its vice-president, Dave Collins, is often quoted by <body wordnetid="107965085" confidence="0.8">

home heating fuel</link>).  Prince Edward Island has been regulating its prices since the 1980s and Newfoundland since the 1990s, however Nova Scotia and New Brunswick only implemented price regulation in 2006 in response to public pressure over wild price fluctuations during the winter of 2005-2006.</p>
<p>

Wilson Fuel's subsidiary Wilsons Gas Stops has been consistently opposed to price regulation based on the company's belief that customers benefit from a free market price.  Wilsons Gas Stops moved into the Prince Edward Island marketplace in early 2005 after purchasing several Esso stations from <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../292/657292.xml">

; this coming after several years of studying how the long-established price regulation scheme was working in that province.  In the days following <hurricane wordnetid="111467018" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../378/2569378.xml">
Hurricane Katrina</link></hurricane>
, wholesale international prices for petroleum increased dramatically, forcing Wilsons and other independent (ie. non-refining) retailers to adjust their prices accordingly, except that this wasn't possible in the regulated retail market in Prince Edward Island.  On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/27530.xml">
September 1</link>, Wilsons Gas Stops announced that it would stop supplying fuel to its company-owned stations and its independent retail customers since the company would be taking a severe financial loss if it were to do so.</p>
<p>

Wilsons Gas Stops has continued to voice concern at increased price regulation in Atlantic Canada in the months since the price fluctuations following Hurricane Katrina.</p>
