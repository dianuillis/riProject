 signed the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/378922.xml">
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act</link>. Scully's role in the passage of this legislation is perhaps his most notable achievement while at CMS.  The bill's most important provision was a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../773/2870773.xml">
Medicare Part D</link>.  Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries can receive prescription drug coverage through private insurance plans that are then reimbursed by CMS.  Scully had fought for prescription drug coverage throughout his time at CMS beginning with an effort to create a discount prescription drug card.  That effort was blocked by lawsuits from the major pharmacy chains that claimed that CMS did not have the statutory authority to create the program.</p>

<p>

In his first speech as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/215745.xml">
CMS</link> Administrator, Scully announced that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/58353.xml">
Medicare</link> would begin collecting and publishing quality data on health care providers across the country including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../221/18994221.xml">
hospitals</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/430716.xml">
nursing homes</link>, home health agencies and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../511/56511.xml">
dialysis</link> centers.  The program began with the reporting of quality measures for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/430716.xml">
nursing homes</link> in a handful of states.  In those states, 78 percent of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/430716.xml">
nursing homes</link> reported that they tried to improve, according to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/215745.xml">
CMS</link>.  The next step for the program was the publication of performance by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/430716.xml">
nursing homes</link> nationwide on 10 measures ranging from the percentage of residents with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../762/902762.xml">
pressure sores</link> to those in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/164653.xml">
physical restraint</link>s.  A $700,000 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/1817986.xml">
advertising campaign</link> publicizing the measures began in conjunction with the release of the data.  The intention of the program was to provide consumers with a comparison of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../716/430716.xml">
nursing homes</link> while encouraging the homes to get better, according to a statement by Scully at the time.  Critics of the program complained that nursing homes were being asked to do additional work in order to report the measures while they were dealing with funding cutbacks.  </p>
<p>

In July <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/36163.xml">
2003</link>, Scully announced that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/215745.xml">
CMS</link> would begin paying bonuses to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../221/18994221.xml">
hospitals</link> that scored well on 35 quality measures.  Hospitals nationwide would vie for $7 million in higher reimbursement by providing superior care for five conditions: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../969/60969.xml">
heart attack</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../930/249930.xml">
heart failure</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/52135.xml">
pneumonia</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../248/195248.xml">
coronary artery bypass surgery</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/1125423.xml">
hip</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/2830398.xml">
knee replacement</link>s.  In addition, CMS posted report cards on the hospitals' performance on the public CMS website.  The program was hailed as large step towards improving the American <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/60976.xml">
health care system</link> by leading to a more rational <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../676/4085676.xml">
health care pricing system</link>.</p>
<p>

Scully also initiated a broad public education campaign to improve seniors’ awareness and utilization of their Medicare benefits.  The $30 million advertising campaign called, "Helping You Help Yourself was designed to inform Medicare <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/1195256.xml">
beneficiaries</link> about the Medicare web site and toll-free phone number, which could answer their questions about health care plans.</p>

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../844/15844.xml">
July 1</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/34551.xml">
2001</link> Scully presided over his agency's name change: the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/215745.xml">
Health Care Financing Administration</link> would now be called the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/215745.xml">
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</link>. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/58250.xml">
Department of Health and Human Services</link> Secretary <official wordnetid="110372373" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/217709.xml">

 explained that in order "to give the agency a new direction, a new spirit, it is necessary that we give it a new name - one that truly reflects the agency's vital mission to serve millions of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries across America."</p>

 Controversy at CMS </st>
<p>

Scully's CMS career was not without conflict.  According to an internal investigation by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/58250.xml">
Department of Health and Human Services</link>, Scully took part in efforts to intentionally withhold cost estimates of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../773/2870773.xml">
Medicare prescription drug benefit</link> from Congress while it was being considered for law.  A report on the investigation said that Scully threatened to fire Medicare's chief actuary, Richard Foster, if he provided the data to Congress.  However, the report found that neither the threat nor the withholding of information violated any criminal law.  Scully denied threatening Foster, but acknowledged having told him to withhold information from Congress.  Foster estimated that the Medicare legislation would cost $500-$600 billion over 10 years.  The White House told Congress the cost would not exceed $400 billion.  A subsequent report by the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../772/370772.xml">
Congressional Research Service</link></agency>
 concluded that Scully and the Bush administration broke federal law by telling Foster to withhold information from Congress because it violated Congress' "right to receive truthful information from federal agencies to assist in its legislative functions is clear and unassailable."</p>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../163/36163.xml">
2003</link>, the Gallup Organization filed a $5 million lawsuit against him alleging that he asked an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../502/254502.xml">
OMB</link> aide to investigate a Gallup executive who had accused CMS of unfairly favoring a competing firm in a hospital-survey project.  </p>
<p>

While he was participating in the crafting of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../922/378922.xml">
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act</link>, Scully interviewed with law firms and private equity firms that might have been affected by the bill, for which he sought and received a waiver from the top ethics officer for the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
