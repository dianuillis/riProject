Soaps are useful for cleaning because soap <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../555/19555.xml">
molecule</link>s attach readily to both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/361038.xml">

polar</link> molecules (such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../306/33306.xml">
water</link>). Although grease will normally adhere to skin or clothing, the soap molecules can attach to it as a "handle" and make it easier to rinse away. Applied to a soiled surface, soapy water effectively holds particles in suspension so the whole of it can be rinsed off with clean water.</p>

(fatty end)  :CH3-(CH2)n  -  COONa:  (water soluble end)  </p>
<p>

The hydrocarbon ("fatty") portion dissolves dirt and oils, while the ionic end makes it soluble in water. Therefore, it allows water to remove normally-insoluble matter by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../290/10290.xml">

The most popular soapmaking process today is the cold process method, where fats such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link> react with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../877/57877.xml">
lye</link>. Soapmakers sometimes use the melt and pour process, where a premade soap base is melted and poured in individual molds.  While some people think that this is not really soap-<it>making</it>, the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.soapguild.org/">
Hand Crafted Soap Makers Guild</weblink> does recognize this as a legitimate form of soap making or soap crafting. Some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/1393365.xml">
soaper</link>s also practice other processes, such as the historical hot process, and make special soaps such as clear soap (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../767/2732767.xml">
glycerin soap</link>), which must be made through the melt and pour process.</p>
<p>

Handmade soap differs from industrial soap in that, usually, an excess of fat is sometimes used to consume the alkali (<it>superfatting</it>), and in that the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../732/172732.xml">
glycerin</link> is not removed leaving a naturally moisturising soap and not pure detergent. Superfatted soap, soap which contains excess fat, is more skin-friendly than industrial soap; though, if not properly formulated, it can leave users with a "greasy" feel to their skin.  Often, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../678/188678.xml">
emollient</link>s such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../116/262116.xml">
jojoba</link> oil or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../993/1347993.xml">
shea butter</link> are added 'at trace' (the point at which the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../331/268331.xml">
saponification</link> process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken), after most of the oils have saponified, so that they remain unreacted in the finished soap.  Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process called superfat discount, where, instead of putting in extra fats, the soap maker puts in less lye.</p>

Reacting fat with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../877/57877.xml">
sodium hydroxide</link> will produce a hard soap.</p>

Reacting fat with potassium hydroxide will produce a soap that is either soft or liquid. Historically, the alkali used was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../343/235343.xml">
potassium hydroxide</link> made from the deliberate burning of vegetation such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../560/66560.xml">

</compound>
</substance>
</it>, a common ingredient in many soaps, is derived from <link>
rendered</link> beef fat. Soap can also be made of vegetable oils, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/57561.xml">
palm oil</link>, and the product is typically softer. If soap is made from pure <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link> it may be called Castile soap or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/9397546.xml">
Marseille soap</link>. Castile is also sometimes applied to soaps with a mix of oils, but a high percentage of olive oil.</p>
<p>

An array of oils and butters are used in the process such as olive, coconut, palm, cocoa butter, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/324632.xml">
hemp oil</link> and shea butter to provide different qualities.  For example, olive oil provides mildness in soap; coconut oil provides lots of lather; while coconut and palm oils provide hardness.  Sometimes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/172190.xml">
castor oil</link> can also be used as an ebullient.  Most common, though, is a combination of coconut, palm, and olive oils.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Process</st>
<p>

In both cold-process and hot-process soapmaking, heat may be required for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../331/268331.xml">
saponification</link>. </p>
<p>

Cold-process soapmaking takes place at a temperature sufficiently above room temperature to ensure the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../648/20648.xml">
liquification</link> of the fat being used, and requires that the lye and fat be kept warm after mixing to ensure that the soap is completely saponified.</p>
<p>

Unlike cold-processed soap, hot-processed soap can be used right away because lye and fat saponify more quickly at the higher temperatures used in hot-process soapmaking.</p>
<p>

Hot-process was used when the purity of lye was unreliable, and can use natural lye solutions such as potash. The main benefit of hot processing is that the exact concentration of the lye solution does not need to be known to perform the process with adequate success.</p>
<p>

Cold-process requires exact measurement of lye to fat using saponification charts to ensure that the finished product is mild and skin-friendly. Saponification charts can also be used in hot-process soapmaking, but are not as necessary as in cold-process.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Hot process</entry>
</list>

In the hot-process method, lye and fat are boiled together at 80&ndash;100 ¬∞C until saponification occurs, which the soapmaker can determine by taste (the bright, distinctive taste of lye disappears once all the lye is saponified) or by eye (the experienced eye can tell when gel stage and full saponification have occurred).</p>
<p>

After saponification has occurred, the soap is sometimes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/286262.xml">
precipitated</link> from the solution by adding salt, and the excess liquid drained off.</p>
<p>

The hot, soft soap is then spooned into a mold.</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="definition">

Cold process</entry>
</list>

A cold-process soapmaker first looks up the saponification value of the fats being used on a saponification chart, which is then used to calculate the appropriate amount of lye. Excess unreacted lye in the soap will result in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin. Not enough lye, and the soap is greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 4-10% discount of lye so that all of the lye is reacted and that excess fat is left for skin conditioning benefits.</p>
<p>

The lye is dissolved in water.  Then oils are heated, or melted if they are solid at room temperature.  Once both substances have cooled to approximately 100-110¬∞F (37-43¬∞C), and are no more than 10¬∞F (~5.5¬∞C) apart, they may be combined.  This lye-fat mixture is stirred until "trace" (modern-day amateur soapmakers often use a stick blender to speed this process).  There are varying levels of trace.  Depending on how your additives will affect trace, they may be added at light trace, medium trace or heavy trace.  After much stirring, the mixture turns to the consistency of a thin pudding. </p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../028/281028.xml">
Essential oil</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../211/1712211.xml">
fragrance oil</link>s, botanicals, herbs, oatmeal or other additives are added at light trace, just as the mixture starts to thicken.</p>
<p>

The batch is then poured into molds, kept warm with towels or blankets, and left to continue saponification for 18 to 48 hours. Milk soaps are the exception. They do not require insulation. Insulation may cause the milk to burn. During this time, it is normal for the soap to go through a "gel phase" where the opaque soap will turn somewhat transparent for several hours before turning opaque again. The soap will continue to give off heat for many hours after trace.</p>
<p>

After the insulation period the soap is firm enough to be removed from the mold and cut into bars.  At this time, it is safe to use the soap since saponification is complete.  However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2-6 weeks (depending on initial water content) before use.  If using caustic soda it is recommended that the soap is left to cure for at least 4 weeks.</p>

Purification and finishing</st>
<p>

The common process of purifying soap involves removal of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/80207.xml">
sodium chloride</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../877/57877.xml">
sodium hydroxide</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../732/172732.xml">
glycerol</link>. These components are removed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../636/52636.xml">
boiling</link> the crude soap <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../287/214287.xml">
curd</link>s in water and re-precipitating the soap with salt.</p>
<p>

Most of the water is then removed from the soap. This was traditionally done on a chill roll which produced the soap flakes commonly used in the 1940s and 1950s. This process was superseded by spray dryers and then by vacuum dryers. </p>
<p>

The dry soap (approximately 6-12% moisture) is then compacted into small pellets. These pellets are now ready for soap finishing, the process of converting raw soap pellets into a salable product, usually bars.</p>
<p>

Soap pellets are combined with fragrances and other materials and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner which, by means of an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../580/1204580.xml">
auger</link>, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) in a manner similar to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../623/1313623.xml">
calendering</link> paper or plastic or to making <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/1217251.xml">
chocolate liquor</link>. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion it passes through a vacuum chamber to remove any entrapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/18994037.xml">
Sand</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/230364.xml">
pumice</link> may be added to produce a  soap. This process is most common in creating soaps used for human hygiene. The scouring agents serve to remove dead skin cells from the surface being cleaned. This process is called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../580/3825580.xml">
exfoliation</link>. Many newer materials are used for exfoliating soaps which are effective but do not have the sharp edges and poor size distribution of pumice.</p>

Dinars</link>) a piece in 981 AD. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../607/24607.xml">
Persian</link> chemist <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../209/78209.xml">
Al-Razi</link> wrote a manuscript on recipes for true soap. A recently discovered manuscript from the 13th century details more recipes for soap making; e.g. take some sesame oil, a sprinkle of potash, alkali and some lime, mix them all together and boil. When cooked, they are poured into molds and left to set, leaving hard soap.</p>

In semi-modern times soap was made by mixing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../557/188557.xml">
animal fat</link>s with lye. Because of the caustic lye, this was a dangerous procedure (perhaps more dangerous than any present-day home activities) which could result in serious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../093/628093.xml">
chemical burn</link>s or even <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../433/3433.xml">
blindness</link>. Before commercially-produced lye (sodium hydroxide) was commonplace, potash, potassium hydroxide, was produced at home from the ashes of a hardwood fire.</p>

In modern times, the use of soap has become universal in industrialized nations due to a better understanding of the role of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../020/147020.xml">
hygiene</link> in reducing the population size of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../358/24358.xml">
pathogenic</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/20377.xml">
microorganisms</link>. Manufactured bar soaps first became available in the late nineteenth century, and advertising campaigns in Europe and the United States helped to increase popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health. </p>

Rarely, conditions allow for corpses to naturally turn in to a soap-like substance, such as the Soap Lady on exhibit in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/1242709.xml">
