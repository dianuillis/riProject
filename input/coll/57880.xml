A colloquial term for babies conceived as the result of IVF, <b><it>test tube babies</it></b>, refers to the tube-shaped containers of glass or plastic resin, called <it>test tubes,</it> that are commonly used in chemistry labs and biology labs. However <it>in vitro</it> fertilisation is usually performed in the shallower containers called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/43942.xml">
petri dish</link>es. (Petri-dishes may also be made of plastic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/58890.xml">

Indications</st>
<p>

Initially IVF was developed to overcome <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../242/179242.xml">
infertility</link> due to problems of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../468/11468.xml">
fallopian tube</link>, but it turned out that it was successful in many other infertility situations as well. The introduction of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/153187.xml">
intracytoplasmic sperm injection</link> (ICSI) addresses the problem of male infertility to a large extent.   </p>
<p>

For IVF to be successful it may be easier to say that it requires healthy <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../214/190214.xml">
ova</link>, sperm that can fertilise, and a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../863/31863.xml">
uterus</link> that can maintain a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../587/1771587.xml">
pregnancy</link>. Cost considerations generally place IVF as a treatment when other less expensive options have failed.</p>
<p>

This means that IVF can be used for females who have already gone through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/49611.xml">
menopause</link>.  The donated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../288/559288.xml">
oocyte</link> can be fertilised in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/185775.xml">
crucible</link>. If the fertilisation is successful, the <link>
fertilised egg</link> will be transferred into the uterus, within which it will develop into an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../624/36624.xml">
embryo</link>.</p>

gonadotropin</link>s (usually <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../328/323328.xml">

Transvaginal oocyte retrieval</link></it>  
</indent>
When follicular maturation is judged to be adequate, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../445/300445.xml">
human chorionic gonadotropin</link> (β-hCG) is given.  This agent, which acts as an analogue of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../590/248590.xml">
luteinising hormone</link>, would cause ovulation about 36 hours after injection, but a retrieval procedure takes place just prior to that, in order to recover the egg cells from the ovary.  The eggs are retrieved from the patient using a transvaginal technique involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries.  Through this needle follicles can be aspirated, and the follicular fluid is handed to the IVF laboratory to identify ova.  The retrieval procedure takes about 20 minutes and is usually done under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/185369.xml">
conscious sedation</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../561/398561.xml">

 Fertilisation </st>
<p>

In the laboratory, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells and prepared for fertilisation.  In the meantime, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../168/18842168.xml">
semen</link> is prepared for fertilisation by removing inactive cells and seminal fluid. If semen is being provided by a sperm donor, it will usually have been prepared for treatment before being frozen and quarantined, and it will be thawed ready for use. The sperm and the egg are incubated together (at a ratio of about 75,000:1) in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/1623208.xml">
culture media</link> for about 18 hours.  By that time <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/46828.xml">
fertilisation</link> should have taken place and the fertilised egg would show two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../228/1795228.xml">
pronuclei</link>.  In situations where the sperm count is low, a single sperm is injected directly into the egg using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/153187.xml">
intracytoplasmic sperm injection</link> (ICSI).  The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg has reached the 6-8 cell stage.

 Selection </st>
<p>

Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge oocyte and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../624/36624.xml">
embryo</link> quality.  Typically, embryos that have reached the 6-8 cell stage are transferred three days after retrieval.  In many American and Australian programmes, however, embryos are placed into an extended culture system with a transfer done at the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../337/444337.xml">
blastocyst</link> stage, especially if many good-quality day-3 embryos are available. Blastocyst stage transfers have been shown to result in higher pregnancy rates.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. In Europe, day-2 transfers are common.</p>

<p>

<indent level="1">

<it>Main article: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../392/1399392.xml">
Embryo transfer</link></it>
</indent>

Embryos are graded by the embryologist based on the number of cells, evenness of growth and degree of fragmentation.  The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the woman and other health and diagnostic factors.  In countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are transferred except in unusual circumstances.  For instance, a woman over 35 may have up to three embryos transferred.  This is to limit the number of multiple pregnancies. The embryos judged to be the "best"  are transferred to the patient's uterus through a thin, plastic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../838/291838.xml">
catheter</link>, which goes through her <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../476/32476.xml">
vagina</link> and cervix. Several embryos may be passed into the uterus to improve chances of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../937/7357937.xml">
implantation</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../587/1771587.xml">

Success rates</st>




<p>

According to a 2005 Swedish study published in the Oxford Journal 'Human Reproduction' 166 women were monitored starting one month before their IVF cycles and the results showed no significant correlation between psychological stress and their IVF outcomes. The study concluded with the recommendation to clinics that it might be possible to reduce the stress experienced by IVF patients during the treatment procedure by informing them of those findings. While psychological stress experienced during a cycle might not influence an IVF outcome, it is possible that the experience of IVF can result in stress that leads to depression. The financial consequences alone of IVF can influence anxiety and become overwhelming.  However, for many couples, the alternative is infertility, and the experience of infertility itself can also cause extreme stress and depression.</p>

Complications</st>
<p>

The major complication of IVF is the risk of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/79449.xml">
multiple birth</link>s.<weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/breeder_reaction.html">
http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/breeder_reaction.html</weblink> This is directly related to the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer. Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, obstetrical complications, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../544/1032544.xml">
prematurity</link>, and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred have been enacted in some countries (e.g., England) to reduce the risk of high-order multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins.  A double blind, randomised study followed IVF pregnancies that resulted in 73 infants (33 boys and 40 girls) and reported that 8.7% of singleton infants and 54.2% of twins had a birth weight of  2500 g <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. However recent evidence suggest that singleton offspring after IVF is at higher risk for lower birth weight for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>

Another risk of ovarian stimulation is the development of  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../614/1417614.xml">
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome</link>.</p>
<p>

If the underlying infertility is related to abnormalities in spermatogenesis, it is plausible, but too early to examine that male offspring is at higher risk for sperm abnormalities.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Birth defects</st>
<p>

The issue of  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../263/321263.xml">
birth defect</link>s remains a controversial topic in IVF.  A majority of studies  do not show a significant increase after use of IVF. Some studies suggest higher rates for ICSI , while others do not support this finding.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/souls_on_ice.html</weblink> The advantage is that patients who fail to conceive may become pregnant using such embryos without having to go through a full IVF cycle. Or, if pregnancy occurred, they could return later for another pregnancy. Spare embryos resulting from fertility treatments may be donated to another woman or couple, and embryos may be created, frozen and stored specifically for transfer and donation by using donor eggs and sperm.</p>

Adjunctive interventions</st>
<p>

There are several variations or improvements of IVF, such as ICSI, ZIFT, GIFT and PGD.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
ICSI</st>

<p>

(ICSI) is a more recent development associated with IVF which allows the sperm to be directly injected in to the egg.
This is used where sperm have difficulty penetrating the egg and in these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. ICSI results in success rates equal to IVF fertilisation.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
ZIFT</st>
<p>
 
Eggs are removed from the woman, fertilised and then placed in the woman's fallopian tubes rather than the uterus.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
GIFT</st>

<p>

Eggs are removed from the woman, and placed in one of the fallopian tubes, along with the man's sperm. This allows fertilisation to take place inside the woman's body. Therefore, this variation is actually an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/15187.xml">
in vivo</link> fertilisation, and not an <it>in vitro</it> fertilisation.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>

PGD</st>

<p>

<indent level="1">

PGD can be performed on embryos prior to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../392/1399392.xml">
embryo transfer</link>. A similar, but more general test has been developed called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../419/5630419.xml">

But success rate of PGD is much lower. (source needed)</p>

Courtney Cross</link>, also in 1978, and another unnamed birth from Oldham, the world’s first IVF babies. This was followed by the birth of Candice Reed in Melbourne in 1980. It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.</p>
<p>

This was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash university team. The Jones team in Norfolk, Virginia, further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the requirement for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more user-friendly both for staff and patients. </p>
<p>

The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has also significantly improved the effectiveness of IVF. The other very significant milestone in IVF was the development of the intra cytoplasmic sperm injection of single sperms by Andre van Steirtegham in Brussels,1992. This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies, sometimes in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy, with some men even with kleinfelter’s syndrome occasionally achieving pregnancy. Thus, IVF has become the final solution for most fertility problems, moving from tubal disease to male factor, idiopathic subfertility, endometriosis, advancing maternal age, and anovulation not responding to ovulation induction.</p>

The IVF process requires sperm, eggs and a uterus. To achieve a pregnancy any of these requirements can be provided by a third person: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../358/1611358.xml">
third party reproduction</link>. This has created additional ethical and legal concerns.</p>

 In a few cases laboratory mix-ups (misidentified gametes, transfer of wrong embryos) have occurred leading to legal action against the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example is the case of a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></entry>

Pregnancy past menopause</st>
<p>

While menopause has set a natural barrier to further conception, IVF has allowed women to be pregnant in their fifties and sixties. Women whose uteruses have been appropriately prepared receive embryos that originated from an egg of an egg donor. Therefore, although these women do not have a genetic link with the child, they have an emotional link through pregnancy and childbirth. In many cases the genetic father of the child is the woman's partner. Even after menopause the uterus is fully capable to carry out its function.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

A recent controversy in California focussed on the question of whether physicians opposed to homosexuality should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple.  Guadalupe T. Benitez, a medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had "religious-based objections to treating homosexuals to help them conceive children by artificial insemination," and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>  The case, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../985/18934985.xml">
North Coast Women's Care Medical Group v. Superior Court</link> was decided in favor of Benitez on August 19, 2008.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>.</p>

Also, embryos are sometimes discarded in the process, resulting in their demise. Catholics and many people of other faiths see embryos as human lives with the same rights as all others and, therefore, view the destruction of embryos as unacceptable.</p>

 Coping with IVF </st>

Due to the emotional and financial aspects of infertility treatment, many feel isolated and sometimes become depressed.  Online support forums and message boards have become a popular way for sufferers to exchange both information and support.  Popular forums include
