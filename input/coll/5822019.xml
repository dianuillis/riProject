Preliminaries</st>
<p>

The object of two-ten-jack is to get the most points by taking tricks containing positive point cards while avoiding tricks containing negative point cards.</p>
<p>

Two players receive six cards each from a standard 52-card deck ranking <b>A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2</b> and the remaining undealt cards are placed between the players to form the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/5821578.xml">
stock</link>. Non-dealer leads the first <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../947/29947.xml">
trick</link> and winner of each trick leads to the next. Players replenish their hands between tricks by each drawing a card from the stock with the winner of the last trick drawing first. Play continues until all of the cards in the entire deck have been played. Points are then tallied before the deck is reshuffled and dealt anew.</p>

Following, Trumping, and Speculation</st>
<p>

In two-ten-jack a player may lead any card and the other player must play a card of the same suit if able, or otherwise must play a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/6509278.xml">
trump card</link> if able. If a player has neither cards in the lead suit or trump, then any other card may be played. The highest trump card, or the highest card of the lead suit if no trumps were played, takes the trick</p>
<p>

In two-ten-jack hearts are always the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/218670.xml">
trump</link> suit and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/520539.xml">
ace of spades</link> is a special trump card known as <b>speculation</b> ranking above all of the hearts. Rules for playing speculation are as follows:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 If a trump (heart) is lead, a player may follow with speculation and must play speculation if no other trumps are held in the hand.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 If a spade is lead, a player may follow with speculation and must likewise play speculation if no other spades are held in the hand.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 If a club or diamond is lead and the other player has neither of these, speculation may be played, and must be played if no other trumps are available.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 A player leading speculation must declare it as either a spade or trump.</entry>
</list>

Scoring and winning</st>
<p>

Cards are worth the following point values:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 2♥, 10♥ and J♥ are worth +5 each</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 2♣, 10♣ and J♣ are worth -5 each</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 2♠, 10♠, J♠ and A♠ are worth +1 each</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 6♦ is worth +1 point</entry>
</list>

Hence the total number of card points per deal is +5. Winner is the first player to reach 31 points. </p>
