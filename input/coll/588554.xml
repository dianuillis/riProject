The Bell trademark (pictured right) used by both the AT&amp;T corporation and the regional operating corporations from 1921 to 1939 to co-brand themselves under a single Bell System trademark would have the regional operating corporation's name where the "name of associated company" appears in this boilerplate version of the trademark.  Phones themselves were made by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../970/229970.xml">
Western Electric</link></company>
, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T, who also owned or controlled the local Bell System companies responsible for local phone service.  Member telephone companies paid a fixed fraction of their revenues as a license fee to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/3712.xml">
Bell Labs</link>.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
 Government sanctioned monopolization </st>
<p>

In 1934, the government set AT&amp;T up as a <link>
regulated monopoly</link> to be under the jurisdiction of the <agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../974/55974.xml">
Federal Communications Commission</link></agency>
.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

As a result, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephone itself.  With control of the phone system, Bell could effectively prohibit its customers from connecting to the system without leasing fees phones not made or sold by Bell companies. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, one had to purchase the phone at cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it. An oft-heard remark at the time was "Ma Bell has you by the calls".</p>

Prior to the 1984 break-up that ended the Bell System, the Bell System included not only AT&amp;T corporate and its long-lines long-distance routing but also Bell Operating Companies.</p>

Bell System trademark used by AT&amp;T and affiliated companies from 1969 to 1983
</caption>
</image>
</p>
<p>

The Bell System trademark (as diagram) and service mark (as the words Bell System in text) was used before <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../787/15787.xml">
January 1</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../578/34578.xml">
1984</link>, when the AT&amp;T divestiture of its regional operating companies took effect.</p>
<p>

Of the various resulting 1984 spinoffs, only <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../382/335382.xml">
BellSouth</link></company>
 actively used and promoted the Bell name and logo for its entire history, from the 1984 break up to its merger with the new AT&amp;T in 2006. Similarly, cessation of using either the Bell name or logo occurred for many of the other companies more than a decade after the 1984 break up as part of an acquisition-related rebranding. The others have only used the marks on rare occasions to maintain their trademark rights, even less now that they have adopted names conceived long after divestiture. Examples include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/18619278.xml">
Verizon</link>, which still uses the Bell logo on its trucks and payphones, and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, a local franchise of the Bell System that was never wholly owned by AT&amp;T and existed separately prior to 1984, also continues to use the Bell name. It stopped using the Bell logo in the summer of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/36164.xml">
2006</link>, though it is still seen on some bills, vehicles, and other literature.</p>
<p>

In 1984, each regional Bell operating company was assigned a set list of names they were allowed to use in combination with the Bell marks. Again, aside from Cincinnati Bell and Malheur Bell, none of these Bell System names are currently in use in the United States.  For example, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../891/340891.xml">

 used both the Bell name and the circled-bell trademark until SBC opted for all of its companies to do business under the "SBC" name in 2002.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/18619278.xml">
Bell Atlantic</link> used the Bell name and circled-bell trademark until renaming itself Verizon in 2000.</p>
<p>

Telephone Companies outside of the Bell System that use "Bell" in their names include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../414/334414.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../579/252579.xml">

 continues to use the Bell name, although cessation of using either the Bell name and circled-bell trademark occurred for some of these companies multiple decades later.  For example, for the multiple decades that <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Bell Canada and its holding-company parent, Bell Canada Enterprises, still use the Bell name and used variations the circled-bell logo until 1977, which until 1976 strongly resembled the 1921 to 1939 Bell System trademark shown above.</p>

The former operating companies of the Bell System listed below are organized according to the current owners of the companies (or their successors). All of these companies, except for Cincinnati Bell, which remains independent, and New England Telephone, which was spun off by Verizon and purchased by FairPoint Communications in 2008, belong to AT&amp;T, Verizon, or Qwest, the three remaining Regional Holding Companies (<link>

Before the 1956 break-up, the Bell System also included the companies listed below.  Bell Canada, Northern Electric, and the Caribbean regional operating companies were considered part of the Bell System proper before the 1956 break-up.  Nippon Electric was considered a more distant affiliate of Western Electric than Northern Electric, where Nippon Electric via its own research and development adapted the designs of Western Electric's North American telecommunications equipment for use in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/15573.xml">

Before the 1956 break-up, Northern Electric was predominantly focused only on manufacturing without any significant amount of separate telecommunication-equipment research &amp; development of its own.  The post-WWII-occupation operation of NTT was considered an administrative adjunct to the North American Bell System.</p>
