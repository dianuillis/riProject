<b>Computer Simulation</b> is a prominent method in organizational studies and strategic management (Harrison, Lin, Carroll, &amp; Carley, 2007). While there are many uses for computer simulation (including the development of engineering systems inside high-technology firms), most academics in the fields of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../450/239450.xml">
strategic management</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/1088262.xml">
organizational studies</link> have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. While the strategy researchers have tended to focus on testing theories of firm performance and many organizational theorists are focused on more descriptive theories, the one uniting theme has been the use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../048/2815048.xml">
computational model</link>s to either verify or extend theories. It is perhaps no accident that those researchers using computational simulation have been inspired by ideas from <link>
biological modeling</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../630/9630.xml">
ecology</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../028/19594028.xml">
theoretical physics</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../952/29952.xml">
thermodynamics</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../295/6295.xml">
chaos theory</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../019/5938019.xml">
complexity theory and organization studies</link> since these methods have also been fruitfully used in those areas.

Basic Distinctions / Definitions</st>

<p>

Researchers studying organizations and firms using computer simulations utilize a variety of basic distinctions and definitions that are common in computational science
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Agent-based vs Equation-based</b>: agent-based models unfold according to the interactions of relatively simple actions, while equation-based models unfold numerically based on a variety of dynamic equations (Note: some argue this is something of a false distinction since some agent based models use equations to direct the behavior of their agents)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Model</b>: simplified versions of the real world that contain only essential elements of theoretical interest (Lave and March 1975)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Complexity of the model</b>: the number of conceptual parts in the model and the connections between those parts (Simon 1969)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Deterministic vs. Stochastic</b>: deterministic models unfold exactly as specified by some pre-specified logic, while stochastic models depend on a variety of draws from probability distributions</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Optimizing vs. Descriptive</b>: models with actors that either seek optimums (like the peaks in fitness landscapes) or do not</entry>
</list>

Methodological Approaches</st>

<p>

There are a variety of different methodological approaches in the area of computational simulation. These include but are not limited to the following. (Note: this list is not Mutually Exclusive nor Collectively Exhaustive, but tries to be fair to the dominant trends. For three different taxonomies see Carley 2001; Davis et al. 2005; Dooley 2002)</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Agent-Based Models</b>: computational models investigating the interaction of multiple agents (many of the following approaches can be 'agent-based' as well)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Cellular Automata</b>: models exploring multiple actors in physical space whose behavior is based on rules</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Dynamic Network Models</b>: any model representing actors and non-actor entities (tasks, resources, locations, beliefs, etc.) as connected through relational links as in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/5162898.xml">
dynamic network analysis</link></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Genetic Algorithms</b>: models of agents whose genetic information can evolve over time</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Equation-Based (or Non-Linear Modeling)</b>: models using (typically <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../103/146103.xml">
non-linear</link>) equations that determine the future state of its systems</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Social Network models</b>: any model representing actors as connected through stereotypical 'ties' as in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network analysis</link></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>NK Modeling</b>: actors modeled as N nodes linked through K connections that are (typically) trying to reach the peak of a fitness landscape</entry>

Early Research</st>

<p>

Early research in strategy and organizations using computational simulation concerned itself with either the macro-behavior of systems or specific organziational mechanisms. Highlights of early research included:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Cohen, March, &amp; Olsen</b>'s (1972) <it>Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice</it> modeled organizations as a set of solutions seeking problems in a rather anarchic 'garbage can'-esque organization.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>March</b>'s (1991) study of <it>Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Learning</it> utilized John Holland's (1975) basic distinction to show the value of slow learners in organizations.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Nelson &amp; Winter</b>'s (1982) <it>Evolutionary theory of economic change</it> used a simulation to show that an evolutionary model could produce the same sort of GDP / productivity numbers as neo-classical rational choice theorizing.</entry>
