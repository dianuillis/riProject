Yellow Peril</link></it>
</indent>
The term "Yellow Peril" refers to an American fear, peaking in the late 19th century, that a large number of Asians would immigrate to the United States and fill the country with a foreign culture and speech incomprehensible to those already here, and take jobs away from Americans.  During this time, numerous anti-Asian sentiments were expressed by politicians and writers, especially on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../579/174579.xml">
West Coast</link>, with headlines like "The 'Yellow Peril'" (<it>Los Angeles Times</it>, 1886) and "Conference Endorses Chinese Exclusion" (<it>The New York Times</it>, 1905) and the later Japanese Exclusion Act.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/827359.xml">

Racial triangulation theory</st>
<p>

According to political science professor/author/scholar Claire Jean Kim, Asian Americans have been racially triangulated in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/18717037.xml">
American society</link> in relation to America's preexisting deeply-rooted black-white bipolar racial dichotomy.  This theory is the intersection of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../854/735854.xml">
model minority</link> stereotype and the Perpetual Foreigner stereotype.  In America's preexisting system of racial valorization, whites have been considered the dominant "superior" group, while blacks have been considered a subordinate "inferior" group, often <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/5966695.xml">
stereotyped</link> as being lazy, cultureless, and primitive throughout American history.  Within this spectrum of racial valorization, the dominant group has labeled Asian Americans as being "superior" to blacks, and are stereotyped as being a hard-working intelligent people (a "model" minority) having an ancient venerable culture, but still "inferior" to whites.  However this contrasts with the other dimension of this theory, both whites and blacks, regardless of valorization, are considered to be "insiders" to American culture; thoroughly assimilated and native to America.  Asian Americans, on the other hand, despite their "superior" valorization by the dominant group in relation to other minorities, are still considered to be unassimilable perpetual "foreigners," inherently fixed in their own exotic Asian cultures and unable to adapt to American ways.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

Model minority stereotype</st>

<p>

<indent level="1">

<it>Main article: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../854/735854.xml">
Model minority</link></it>
</indent>

Asian Americans have also been stereotyped as a "model minority"; that is, positive traits are applied as a stereotype. Asians are seen as hardworking, politically inactive, studious, intelligent, productive, and inoffensive people who have elevated their social standing through merit and diligence.  This label is given in contrast to other stereotypes which often accuse minorities of socially unwelcome traits, such as laziness or criminal tendencies.</p>
<p>

However, Asian Americans believe the model minority stereotype to be damaging and inaccurate, and are fighting to dispel this stereotype. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>  Scholars, activists, and most major American news sources have started to oppose this stereotype, calling it a misconception that exaggerates the success of Asian Americans.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref>  According to those trying to debunk this belief, the model minority stereotype alienates Asian Americans from other minorities and covers up actual Asian American issues and needs that are still not properly addressed in America today.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref>  For example, the widespread notion that Asian Americans earn higher-than-average income obscures issues such as the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../623/637623.xml">
glass ceiling</link>" phenomenon, where advancement into the highest-level managerial or executive positions is blocked,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> and the fact that Asian Americans must acquire more education and work more hours than their white counterparts to earn the same amount of money.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref>  The "model minority" image is also seen as being damaging to Asian American students because their assumed success makes it easy for educators to overlook Asian American students who are struggling academically.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

The model minority stereotypes also hurts statistically underperforming Asian groups, such as the <ethnic_group wordnetid="107967382" confidence="0.8">
<group wordnetid="100031264" confidence="0.8">
<people wordnetid="107942152" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../332/247332.xml">
Pacific Islander</link></people>
</group>
</ethnic_group>
 and Southeast Asian youths whose dilemma is masked by the more publicized successes of the larger <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/251534.xml">
middle-class</link> East Asian population of youth descended from the wave of professionals who emigrated to America during the 1960s.  For example, 25.2% of Asian Americans over age 25 hold a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../874/188874.xml">
bachelor's degree</link> compared to only 15.5% of the general American population, thus giving the impression of Asian American success.  However, only 6.9% of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../751/334751.xml">
Cambodians</link>, and 6.2% of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../158/197158.xml">
Laotians</link> in this age group in America hold bachelor's degrees.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref>  Despite this stereotype of supposed Asian American success, there is a high 80% unemployment rate among the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../386/2316386.xml">
Hmong Americans</link> and other Asian Americans groups from refugee backgrounds. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

Furthermore, the model minority concept can even be emotionally damaging to Asian Americans, particularly since they are expected to live up to their peers who are part of the model minority.  Studies have shown that Asian Americans suffer from higher rates of stress, depression, mental illnesses, and suicide attempts in comparison to other groups.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref>  The pressures to achieve and live up to the model minority image have taken a mental and psychological toll on Asian Americans.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref></p>
<p>

The image of Asian Americans as the model minority also took a hit with a string of incidents involving Asian Americans engaging in criminal or unethical behavior.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> In 2007, Asian Americans were implicated in cheating scandals, shooting sprees, and political corruption.

Thirteen novels, three short stories, and one novelette have been written about Fu Manchu and Sir Denis Nayland Smith, the British agent determined to stop him.  Millions of copies have been sold in the United States with publication in British and American periodicals and adaptations to film, comics, radio, and television.  Due to his enormous popularity, the "image of Fu Manchu has been absorbed into American consciousness as the archetypal Asian villain."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>  In <it>The Insidious Doctor Fu-Manchu</it>, Sax Rohmer introduces Fu Manchu as a cruel and cunning man, with a face like <angel wordnetid="109538915" confidence="0.8">

<p>

Sax Rohmer inextricably tied the evil character of Fu Manchu to the entire Asian race as a manifestation of the yellow peril, attributing the villain's behavior to his race. Rohmer also adds an element of mysticism and exoticism to his portrayal of Fu Manchu.  As Fu Manchu contrives elaborately creative and cruel methods of murdering his victims, he often uses supposedly Asian methods or elements in his murders such as silk rope. It is also important to note here that despite Fu Manchu's specifically Chinese ethnicity, these elements are pan-Asian, again reinforcing his portrayal as a representation of <it>all</it> Asian people.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>  Blatantly racist statements made by white protagonists such as: "the swamping of the white world by yellow hordes might well be the price of our failure" again add to Asian stereotypes of exclusion.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref>  Fu Manchu's inventively sardonic methods of murder and white protagonist Denis Nayland Smith's grudging respect for his intellect reinforce stereotypes of Asian intelligence, exoticism/mysticism, and extreme cruelty.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref></p>

<p>

In stark contrast to the Chinese villain Fu Manchu, Asian American protagonist Charlie Chan represents the American archetype of the "good" Asian.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>  In <it>The House Without a Key</it>, Earl Derr Biggers describes Charlie Chan in the following manner: "He was very fat indeed, yet he walked with the light dainty step of a woman.  His cheeks were chubby as a baby's, his skin ivory tinted, his black hair close-cropped, his amber eyes slanting."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> Charlie Chan speaks English with a heavy accent and flawed grammar, and is meticulously polite and apologetic. After one particular racist affront by a Bostonian woman, Chan responds with exaggerated submission, "Humbly asking pardon to mention it, I detect in your eyes slight flame of hostility.  Quench it, if you will be so kind.  Friendly co-operation are essential between us."  Bowing deeply, he added, "Wishing you good morning."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>
<p>

Because of his emasculated, unassertive, and apologetic physical appearance and demeanor, Charlie Chan comes off as non-threatening to mainstream audiences despite his considerable intellect and ability as an Asian American man.  He holds none of the daring, assertive, or romantic traits generally attributed to white fictional detectives of the time.  Instead, Charlie Chan's successes as a detective are in the context of proving himself to his white superiors or white racists who underestimate him early on in the various plots.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>  His character also perpetuates stereotypes of orientalism as well, as he quotes supposed ancient Chinese wisdom at the end of each novel, saying things like: "The Emperor <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Emasculation and effeminacy</st>
<p>

Historically, Americans have thought of Asian men as feminine and emasculated since the mass immigration of Chinese men to the United States to build the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/51916.xml">
transcontinental railroad</link> during the mid-1800s.  The primary reasons for their emasculated image included the physical appearances of these laborers, and the fact that they did what was considered to be "women's work."  These workers were as a group shorter than the average American man, sported long queues, and sometimes wore long silk gowns.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref> Because Chinese men were seen as an economic threat to the white workforce and laws were passed that barred the Chinese from many industries, the only jobs available to the Chinese of the time were jobs that whites deemed "women's work" (i.e., laundry, cooking, and childcare). <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref> In the press, Asian men were constantly compared to white women<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref>. </p>
<p>

Joan Kee observes that "Asian American male sexuality has long entailed a discourse of nothingness."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref> Instead, according to <link>
Sheridan Prasso</link>, Asian men in film have with little exception been portrayed as "small, sneaky, and threatening... spineless, emasculated wimps", or "incompetents" who always lose when "faced with white man's superior strength or firepower."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref></p>
<p>

The recurring image of the Asian male as a "sexually impotent voyeur or pervert" has pervaded television and film throughout American history.  Examples include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../624/87624.xml">
Mickey Rooney</link> in "yellowface" as the bucktoothed Japanese landlord who sneaks peeps at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/52139.xml">

</it> (1998) which contain Asian male protagonists deny the Asian male characters romances with the white women whose lives that they save.  Instead of the kiss usually granted to the white male protagonist, the rescued white woman only gives the Asian action hero a hug or a grateful obligatory "thank you" kiss; there is almost never a relationship between the characters even if there is romantic tension.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref></p>

The "china doll" stereotype</st>
<p>

According to author <link>
Sheridan Prasso</link>, the China doll stereotype and other variations of this submissive stereotype exist in American movies: "Geisha Girl/Lotus Flower/Servant/China Doll: Submissive, docile, obedient, reverential (including Asian men as effeminate, servile); Vixen/Sex Nymph: Sexy, coquettish, manipulative; tendency toward disloyalty or opportunism; Prostitute/Victim of Sex Trade/War/Oppression: Helpless, in need of assistance or rescue; good-natured at heart." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref></p>

23% of Americans are uncomfortable voting for an Asian American to be President of the United States.
