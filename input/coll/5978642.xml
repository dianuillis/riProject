History</st>

<st>
The Early Years</st>
<p>

The first thirty years of LSU baseball saw its fair share of successes and failures, but the one thing the team lacked was a consistent leader.  The 1895 squad played a total of four games going 0-3-1, which is not surprising considering the team did not have a head coach.  During that time span, LSU had a total of 15 coaches with no coach staying longer than two seasons except C.C. Stroud who remained head coach for 8 seasons.  C.C Stroud coached LSU from 1914-1921 with an overall record of 73-58-5, a winning percentage of .595.  His teams won at least 10 games during 4 of his 8 seasons as head coach of LSU.</p>
<p>

The 1927 season would bring significant change to the LSU baseball program.  <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

As a reward for his team's success on the baseball diamond, Rabenhorst was named SEC Coach of the Year in 1939 and 1946<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>, as well.

J. Stanley "Skip" Bertman had been around baseball all his life, and played collegiate ball at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../011/87011.xml">

 from 1958-1960 as a catcher and outfielder.  After graduating with B.A. in health and physical education from Miami, Bertman went to grad school to obtain a master's degree which he completed in 1964.  The next year, Bertman began his coaching career at <school wordnetid="108276720" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 where he remained head coach for 11 seasons.  Bertman's teams won the state title once and finished runner-up two other times during his tenure as head coach.  In 1976, Bertman left Miami Beach High school to join the coaching staff at his Alma Mater as an assistant coach under legendary coach <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

.  In 1982, Bertman helped the Miami Hurricanes claim their first national title, and would leave after the 1983 season to become the twenty-third Head Coach of LSU.</p>
<p>

Bertman turned the LSU baseball program around quickly, leading the Tigers to postseason play in his second year for the first time in a decade.  During his third year, LSU made their first appearance in the <playoff wordnetid="107465290" confidence="0.8">

, and the Tigers would become a regular in Omaha making 11 appearances during Bertman's 18 year career.  LSU made it back to Omaha during the 1987 season, but failed to make the NCAA Division I baseball tournament in 1988 despite finishing the year with a record of 39-21.</p>
<p>

Bertman would use the 1989 season to catapult LSU baseball into a dynasty in the 1990s.  Bertman's 1989 team made it back the postseason which started a string of 17 consecutive postseason appearances that would finally be snapped in 2006.

The Tigers entered the NCAA tournament on a 2-game losing streak that included losses to Florida and Kentucky and were eliminated from  the <link>
1996 SEC Baseball Tournament</link>.  However, based on their regular season performance, LSU was selected as one of the eight regional host sites for the NCAA tournament.  The Tigers defeated Austin Peay, UNLV and UNO before finally facing Georgia Tech for the chance to go to the College World Series.  LSU defeated Georgia Tech by a score of 29-13 and broke multiple NCAA records, two of which still stand today:  13 hits in an inning and 8 doubles in an inning.</p>
<p>

The Tigers entered the College World Series now on a four game winning streak.  They defeated their first opponent, Wichita State, by a score of 9-8.  LSU then faced the same Florida team that beat them 3 times in the regular season and once in the SEC Tournament.  It seemed that Florida had their number, however, the Tigers won by a score of 9-4.  Florida rebounded, however, and came back through the losers bracket to face LSU again.  This time the Tigers won it 2-1 to move onto the championship game to face <team wordnetid="108208560" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

In what is called one of the most memorable games in College World Series history, LSU defeated Miami (FL) by a score of 9-8.  In the bottom of the 9th inning with 2 outs and a runner on third base LSU only needed a base hit or a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../786/234786.xml">

Skip Bertman led the Tigers to a 44-22-1 mark during his final season as head coach in 2001.    In all, Bertman won 870 games while leading LSU to 7 SEC titles and 11 CWS appearances.  His teams averaged 48 wins per year and only failed to make the postseason twice during his 18 year career.</p>

His jersey, number 15, is one of 4 baseball jerseys retired by LSU.  LSU also renamed a part of South Stadium Drive, between Nicholson and River Road, Skip Bertman Drive in his honor. </p>

Post Skip Bertman</st>
<p>

In anticipation of Skip Bertman's retirement, Laval was brought on as an administrative assistant for the LSU baseball team in 2001.  Raymond "Smoke" Laval would later become Skip Bertman's hand picked successor to lead the LSU Baseball team.  Laval was returning to LSU where he served as an assistant coach under Bertman from 1984-1993.  In 1993, Laval left LSU for his first head coaching job at the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../164/482164.xml">
University of Louisiana-Monroe</link>.  While at ULM, Laval posted a record of 241-159, a winning pecentage of .603, and led the Indians (Now Warhawks) to 3 NCAA regional appearances.</p>

</indent>

Everyone knew the expectations were lofty for Laval when he accepted the job as head coach at LSU.  Replacing a legend is never easy, but Laval appeared to be up for the challenge.  In his first year, Laval led the Tigers to a 44-22 record overall.  The Tigers hosted a regional in Baton Rouge, which they won, and moved on to the Houston Super-Regional to face <sport wordnetid="100523513" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/8886023.xml">
Rice</link></sport>
, where their season ended.  His first year at the helm raised expectations even more after he experienced great success.  </p>
<p>

In 2003 and 2004, Laval would lead the Tigers to 45-22-1 and 46-19 overall record respectively.  LSU would earn the #2 national seed in the 2003 tournament, and would host a super regional both years, meaning the road to Omaha went through Baton Rouge.  LSU was able to get Omaha both years, but disappointed both years posting an 0-2 each year.  The Tigers were not used to losing in Omaha, so questions about Laval's leadership and ability to continue the success of program began to arise.  Laval would have to prove himself the following year.</p>
<p>

In 2005, LSU struggled during the regular season despite the fact they finished with a 40-22 record overall.  The Tigers lost 12 Southeastern Conference games, as well as, losing to Southern for only the second time in 41 tries.  Rice would go on to defeat the Tigers in the Baton Rouge Regional Finals.  The 2006 season would put even more pressure on Laval, and would eventually be his last.</p>
<p>

In his last year, LSU would post a 35-24 mark overall, their worst since 1988, and would miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years.  Laval officially resigned on June 4, 2006.</p>
