. Their only child, Olive Clara Guyton, was born in 1911.</p>
<p>

In 1917, after the U.S. entered the World War I, Guyton joined the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../875/6298875.xml">
126th Infantry Regiment</link> and was attached to the <military_unit wordnetid="108198398" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Death</st>
<p>

At around midnight on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/19459.xml">
May 24</link>, Guyton became the first casualty. He was an automatic gunner on a post near the line of resistance. His instructions were to fire his gun intermittently. While discharging his duties, the Germans returned a barrage of machine gun fire and Guyton was struck in the temple and died instantly. The Commanding General of the 9th French Infantry Division, to which the 126th was attached, issued the following orders on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/19354.xml">
25 May</link>:</p>

General Gamelin, commanding the 9th Infantry Division, cites in the Divisional Order:
The soldier, Joseph W. Guyton, of the 126th American Infantry Regiment, 'on guard in the first line was killed by a machine gun bullet. He is the first soldier of the 32nd American Division to fall fighting for the cause of right and liberty on Alsacian soil, beside his French comrades.'</p>

<p>

General Pershing lists Guyton as killed in action on May 24, 1918, in the Gildwilder Sector in <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. He spoke these words: "In the name of the republic, I bestow this tribute on the casket of the first soldier who perished on the soil of the enemy... I chose it because I am offering the tribute to the one returned whose death on enemy soil marked the day when our civilization went face forward and the assault on our present day civilization knew it had failed.  <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/19459.xml">
May 24</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/34594.xml">
1918</link>, is the date on which this soldier was killed, and the name is that of Joseph W. Guyton, Company I of the 126th Infantry, a resident patriot and hero of the State of Michigan of the United States of America."</p>
<p>

Guyton's remains were returned from New Jersey to Evart by rail and were met at the depot by his parents, relatives, friends, citizens of the town, and members of the Joseph W. Guyton Post of the American Legion named in his honor.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../820/15820.xml">
June 5</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../724/34724.xml">
1921</link>, 10,000 people gathered in Evart to pay tribute to the hero. On hand were dignitaries of the military, state government, local government, and a number of Civil War veterans. The local Evart newspaper reported that over 1,000 automobiles and 500 soldiers were present in the small community that day. Guyton's remains were buried at Forest Hill cemetery outside of the town.</p>
<p>

The following week, Guyton's ten-year old daughter, Olive, presented the American flag, which had draped Guyton's casket to the local American Legion Post. Olive made the presentation with the assistance of her uncle, L.V. Guyton of Lancaster, Ohio, as her mother had died from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/19572217.xml">
influenza</link> just months after her husband had been killed.  Olive died just one year later from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/52135.xml">
pneumonia</link>.</p>
<p>

Within the city of Evart today are a park and highway bridge both dedicated to the memory of Joseph W. Guyton. In Guyton Park stands a cannon dating back to WWI and a monument to the memory of all who lost their lives from Evart during WWI, WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam conflict. Memorial Day ceremonies begin at the Guyton Park and conclude at Forest Hill Cemetery. The memory of Joseph Guyton and the many others who gave their lives will never be forgotten.</p>
