Biosynthesis</st>

<p>

The major pathway for mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the liver via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. In this pathway, the sulfhydryl group of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/52644.xml">
cysteine</link> is first oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid by the enzyme <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/1484644.xml">
cysteine dioxygenase</link>. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../808/14284808.xml">
sulfinoalanine decarboxylase</link> to form <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../656/19152656.xml">
hypotaurine</link>. It is unclear whether hypotaurine is then spontaneously or enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine.</p>
<p>

Taurine in the pharmaceutical and lab setting is synthesized through a combination of cysteine, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../364/59364.xml">
methionine</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../104/54104.xml">
vitamin E</link>. It is naturally produced in testicles of many mammals.  Urban legends surrounding the source of taurine have included bull urine extract and bull semen. While it's true that taurine is found in both sources, it is not the source of taurine in the pharmaceutical or food industry. And while taurine is sometimes extracted from the intestines of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/5307.xml">

cystathionine</link> to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/52644.xml">

There is also evidence that taurine is beneficial for adult human <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/56558.xml">
blood pressure</link> and possibly, the alleviation of other cardiovascular ailments (in humans suffering essential <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../432/77432.xml">

According to animal studies, taurine produces <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../869/2869.xml">
anxiolytic</link> effect and may act as a modulator or anti-anxiety agent in the central nervous system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>

Taurine is necessary for normal skeletal muscle functioning.  This was shown by a 2004 study,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> using mice with a genetic taurine deficiency.  They had a nearly complete depletion of skeletal and cardiac muscle taurine levels.  These mice had a reduction of more than 80% of exercise capacity compared to control mice.  The authors expressed themselves as "surprised" that cardiac function showed as largely normal (given various other studies about effects of taurine on the heart).</p>

Taurine is also used in some contact lens solutions.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref></p>

Taurine has also been shown in diabetic rats to decrease weight and decrease <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../406/289406.xml">

There is evidence that taurine may exert a beneficial effect in preventing diabetes-associated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../964/249964.xml">

 Taurine and cats </st>
<p>
 
Taurine is essential for cat health, as cats cannot synthesize the compound.  The absence of taurine causes a cat's retina to slowly degenerate, causing eye problems and (eventually) irreversible blindness — a condition known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../033/895033.xml">
central retinal degeneration</link> (CRD)<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref>, as well as hair loss and tooth decay. In addition, taurine deficiency can cause feline dilated cardiomyopathy, and supplementation can reverse left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Taurine is now a requirement of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/3884785.xml">
Association of American Feed Control Officials</link> (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref></p>

Taurine and bird development</st>
<p>

Recent research has provided evidence that taurine is essential in early bird development of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../336/46336.xml">
passerine</link>s.  Many passerines, regardless of spider availability, seek out many taurine-rich spiders to feed their young particularly in their youngest stages of life.  Researchers later compared the behaviors and development of birds fed a taurine-supplemented diet to a control diet and found that juveniles that were fed taurine-rich diets as neonates were much larger risk takers and more adept at spatial learning tasks.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref></p>

 Synthesis and production </st>
<p>

In 1993, approximately 5,000–6,000 t of taurine was produced; 50% for pet food manufacture, 50% in pharmaceutical applications.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref>  Synthetic taurine is obtained from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../395/2691395.xml">
isethionic acid</link> (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/306169.xml">
ethylene oxide</link> with aqueous <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../147/2861147.xml">
sodium bisulfite</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref>  Another approach is the reaction of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/2447910.xml">
aziridine</link> with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../141/231141.xml">
sulfurous acid</link>. This leads directly to taurine.</p>

Despite being present in many energy foods, it has not been proven to be energy-giving. A study of mice hereditarily unable to transport taurine suggests that it is needed for proper maintenance and functioning of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../541/380541.xml">
skeletal muscle</link>s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref></p>

However, it has been proven effective in removing fatty liver deposits in humans, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../271/865271.xml">
