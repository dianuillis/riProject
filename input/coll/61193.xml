In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/9223.xml">
economics</link>, an <b>externality</b> is an impact on any party not directly involved in an economic decision. An externality occurs when an economic activity causes <b>external costs</b> or <b>external benefits</b> to third party <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../467/985467.xml">
stakeholders</link> who cannot directly affect an economic transaction. In other words, the producers and consumers in a market either do not bear all of the costs or do not reap all of the benefits of the economic activity. For example, manufacturing that causes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/10934212.xml">
air pollution</link> imposes costs on others, while planting forests (rather than other agricultural activities) would improve the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../773/306773.xml">
water quality</link> of those downstream. <p>

In a competitive market, the existence of externalities would mean that either too much or too little of the good would be produced and consumed in terms of overall cost and benefit to society. If there exist external costs (negative externalities) such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../872/24872.xml">
pollution</link>, the good will be overproduced by a competitive market, as the producer does not take into account the external costs when producing the good. If there are external benefits (positive externalities) such as in areas of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/9252.xml">
education</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../753/1086753.xml">
public safety</link>, too little of the good would be produced by private markets as producers and buyers do not take into account the external benefits to others. Here, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the economic benefits and costs for all parties involved.

Implications</st>
<p>

Standard economic theory implies that any voluntary exchange is mutually beneficial to both parties involved in the trade. This is because if either the buyer and the seller would not benefit from the trade, they would refuse it. An exchange however, can result in additional effects on third parties. From the perspective of those affected, these effects may be negative (pollution from a factory), or positive (honey bees that pollinate the garden). <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/438566.xml">
Welfare economics</link> has shown that the existence of externalities result in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, while those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost. </p>
<p>

A voluntary exchange may actually reduce societal welfare if external costs exist. The person who is affected by the negative externality in the case of air pollution will see it as lowered utility: either subjective displeasure or potentially explicit costs, such as higher medical expenses. The externality may even be seen as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/215415.xml">
trespass</link> on their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../863/36863.xml">
lung</link>s, violating their property rights. Thus, an external cost may pose an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/9258.xml">
ethical</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/22986.xml">
political</link> problem. Alternatively, it might be seen as a case of poorly-defined <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/23626.xml">
property right</link>s, as with, for example, pollution of bodies of water that may belong to no-one (either figuratively, in the case of publicly-owned, or literally, in some countries and/or legal traditions).</p>
<p>

An external benefit, on the other hand, would increase the utility of third parties at no cost to them. Since collective societal welfare is improved, but the providers have no way of monetizing the benefit, less of the good will be produced than would be optimal for society as a whole. Goods with positive externalities include education (believed to increase societal productivity and well-being; but controversial, as these benefits may be internalized), health care (which may reduce the health risks and costs for third parties for such things as transmittable diseases) and law enforcement. Positive externalities are frequently associated with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../217/52217.xml">
free rider problem</link>. For example, individuals who are vaccinated reduce the risk of contracting the relevant disease for all others around them, and at high levels of vaccination, society may receive large health and welfare benefits; but any one individual can refuse vaccination, still avoiding the disease by "free riding" on the costs borne by others.</p>
<p>

There are a number of potential means of improving overall social utility when externalities are involved. The market-driven approach to correcting externalities is to "<it>internalize</it>" third party costs and benefits, for example, by requiring a polluter to repair any damage caused. In many cases, however, internalizing costs or benefits is not feasible, especially if the true monetary values cannot be determined.</p>
<p>

The monetary value of externalities are difficult to quantify, as they may reflect the ethical views and preferences of the entire population.  It may not be clear whose preferences are most important, interests may conflict, the value of externalities may be difficult to determine, and all parties involved may attempt to influence the policy responses to their own benefit.  An example is the externalities of smoking, which can cost or benefit society depending on the situation.  Because it may not be feasible to monetize the costs and benefits, another method is needed to either impose solutions or aggregate the choices of society, when externalities are significant. This may be through some form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../318/52318.xml">
representative democracy</link> or other means. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/46044.xml">
Political economy</link> is, in broad terms, the study of the means and results of aggregating those choices and benefits that are not limited to purely private transactions.</p>

In these situations the marginal social benefit of consumption is less than the marginal private benefit of consumption. (i.e. SMB  PMB) This leads to the good or service being over-consumed relative to the social optimum. Without intervention the good or service will be under-priced and the negative externalities will not be taken into account.</p>

 Sometimes the better part of a benefit from a good comes from having the option to buy something rather than actually having to buy it. A private fire department that only charged people that had a fire, would arguably provide a positive externality at the expense of an unlucky few. Some form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../176/15176.xml">
insurance</link> could be a solution in such cases, as long as people can accurately evaluate the benefit they have from the option.</entry>

As noted, externalities (or proposed solutions to externalities) may also imply political conflicts, rancorous lawsuits, and the like. This may make the problem of externalities too complex for the concept of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../468/45468.xml">
Pareto optimality</link> to handle.  Similarly, if too many positive externalities fall outside the participants in a transaction, there will be too little incentive on parties to participate in activities that lead to the positive externalities.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Positional</st>
<p>

Positional externalities refer to a special type of externality that depends on the relative rankings of actors in a situation.  Because every actor is attempting to "one up" other actors, the consequences are unintended and economically inefficient.</p>
<p>

One example is the phenomenon of "<link>
overeducation</link>" (referring to post-secondary education) in the North American labour market. In the 1960s, many young middle-class North Americans prepared for their careers by completing a bachelor's degree. However, by the 1990s, many people from the same social milieu were completing master's degrees, hoping to "one up" the other competitors in the job market by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/1865916.xml">
signalling</link> their higher quality as potential employees. By the 2000s, some jobs which had previously only demanded bachelor's degrees, such as policy analysis posts, were requiring master's degrees. Some economists argue that this increase in educational requirements was above that which was efficient, and that it was a misuse of the societal and personal resources that go into the completion of these master's degrees.</p>
<p>

Another example is the buying of jewelry as a gift for another person.  In order for Person A to show that he values his spouse more than Person B values his spouse, Person A must buy his spouse more expensive jewelry than Person B buys.  As in the first example, the cycle continues to get worse, because every actor positions himself/herself in relation to the other actors.</p>
<p>

One solution to such externalities is regulations imposed by an outside authority.  For the first example, the government might pass a law against firms requiring master's degrees unless the job actually required these advanced skills.</p>

 Supply and demand diagram </st>
<p>

The usual economic analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a standard <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../664/29664.xml">
supply and demand</link> diagram if the externality can be monetized and valued in terms of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/8983183.xml">
money</link>. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the <it>private cost</it> that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the <it>true</it> cost that society as a whole pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../415/425415.xml">
social cost</link>. </p>
<p>

Similarly there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../945/570945.xml">
effective demand</link> in the market.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Negative externalities </st>
<p>

The graph below shows the effects of a negative externality. For example, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../058/27058.xml">
steel industry</link> is assumed to be selling in a competitive market &ndash; before pollution-control laws were imposed and enforced (e.g. under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../451/165451.xml">
laissez-faire</link>). The marginal private cost is less than the marginal social or public cost by the amount of the external cost, i.e., the cost of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/10934212.xml">
air pollution</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../266/312266.xml">
water pollution</link>. This is represented by the vertical distance between the two supply curves. It is assumed that there are no external benefits, so that social benefit <it>equals</it> individual benefit. </p>
<p>

<image location="left" width="300px" src="Negative_externality.jpg" type="thumb">

Supply &amp; Demand with external costs

</image>
If the consumers only take into account their own private cost, they will end up at price <b>Pp</b> and quantity <b>Qp</b>, instead of the more efficient price <b>Ps</b> and quantity <b>Qs</b>. These latter reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased <it>only</it> as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/11826.xml">
free market</link> is <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/582932.xml">
inefficient</link></it> since at the quantity <b>Qp</b>, the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole would be better off if the goods between <b>Qp</b> and <b>Qs</b> had not been produced. The problem is that people are buying and consuming <it>too much</it> steel. </p>
<p>

This discussion implies that pollution is <it>more than</it> merely an ethical problem; it is more than just "greedy"  and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/18487619.xml">
profit</link>-maximizing  firms. The problem is one of the disjuncture between marginal and social costs that is not solved by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/11826.xml">
free market</link>. There is a problem of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This discussion also implies that pollution is not something solved by competitive markets. In fact, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../878/18878.xml">
monopoly</link> might be able to use some of its excess profits to be benevolent and <it>internalize the externality</it> (pay the cost of the pollution). More likely, a monopoly would artificially restrict the quantity supplied in order to maximize profits. This would actually benefit society in this situation because it would mean less pollution than in the competitive case. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/23002.xml">
Perfectly competitive</link> firms have no choice but to produce according to market incentives or private costs: if one decides to internalize external costs, it implies that this producer would incur higher costs than those of its competitors and likely be forced to exit from the market. So some <it>collective</it> solution is needed, such as, government intervention banning or discouraging pollution, by means of economic incentives such as taxes, or an alternative economy such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../393/76393.xml">
participatory economics</link>.</p>

 Beneficial externalities </st>
<p>

The graph below shows the effects of a positive or beneficial externality. For example, the industry supplying smallpox vaccinations is assumed to be selling in a competitive market.  The marginal private benefit of getting the vaccination is less than the marginal social or public benefit by the amount of the external benefit (for example, society as a whole is increasingly protected from smallpox by each vaccination, including those who refuse to participate). This marginal external benefit of getting a smallpox shot is represented by the vertical distance between the two demand curves. Assume there are no external costs, so that social cost <it>equals</it> individual cost.</p>
<p>

<image location="left" width="300px" src="EXTBENE.jpg" type="thumb">
<caption>

Supply &amp; Demand with external benefits

</image>
 If consumers only take into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price <b>Pp</b> and quantity <b>Qp</b> as before, instead of the more efficient price <b>Ps</b> and quantity <b>Qs</b>. These latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/11826.xml">
unfettered market</link> is <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../932/582932.xml">
inefficient</link></it> since at the quantity <b>Qp</b>, the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying <it>too few</it> vaccinations. </p>
<p>

The issue of external benefits is related to that of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/173155.xml">
public goods</link>, which are goods where it is difficult if not impossible to exclude people from benefits. The production of a public good has beneficial externalities for all, or almost all, of  the public. As with external costs, there is a problem here of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This also implies that vaccination is not something solved by competitive markets. The government may have to step in with a collective solution, such as subsidizing or legally requiring vaccine use. If the government does this, the good is called a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../680/1230680.xml">
merit good</link>.</p>

Possible Solutions</st>
<p>

There are at least four general types of solutions to the problem of externalities:

<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Criminalization: As with prostitution, addictive drugs, commercial fraud, and many types of environmental and public health laws.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/372081.xml">
Pigovian tax</link>es or subsidies intended to redress economic injustices or imbalances.</entry>
</list>

Economists prefer Pigouvian taxes and subsidies as being the least intrusive and potentially the most efficient method to resolve externalities. </p>
<p>

Government intervention may not always be needed. Traditional ways of life may have evolved as ways to deal with external costs and benefits. Alternatively, democratically-run communities can agree to deal with these costs and benefits in an amicable way. Externalities can sometimes be resolved by agreement between the parties involved. This resolution may even come about because of the threat of government action. </p>
<p>

The first, and most common type of agreement, is tacit agreement through the political process.  Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests.  Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm.  These laws and regulations can take the form of "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../305/7092305.xml">
command and control</link>" regulation (such as setting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/18934904.xml">

 argued that if all parties involved can easily organize payments so as to pay each other for their actions, an efficient outcome can be reached without government intervention. Some take this argument further, and make the political claim that government should restrict its role to facilitating bargaining among the affected groups or individuals and to enforcing any contracts that result. This result, often known as the <link>
Coase Theorem</link>, requires that

If all of these conditions apply, the private parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities.</p>
<p>

This theorem would not apply to the steel industry case discussed above. For example, with a steel factory that trespasses on the lungs of a large number of individuals with pollution, it is difficult if not impossible for any one person to negotiate with the producer, and there are large transaction costs. Hence the most common approach may be to regulate the firm (by imposing limits on the amount of pollution considered "acceptable") while paying for the regulation and enforcement with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
taxes</link>. The case of the vaccinations would also not satisfy the requirements of the Coase Theorem. Since the potential external beneficiaries of vaccination are the people themselves, the people would have to self-organize to pay each other to be vaccinated. But such an organization that involves the entire populace would be indistinguishable from government action.</p>
<p>

This does not say that the Coase theorem is irrelevant. For example, if a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/68110.xml">
logger</link> is planning to clear-cut a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../090/11090.xml">
forest</link> in a way that has a negative impact on a nearby <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../772/471772.xml">
resort</link>, the resort-owner and the logger could theoretically get together to agree to a deal. For example, the resort-owner could pay the logger not to clear-cut – or could buy the forest. The most problematic situation, from Coase's perspective, occurs when the forest literally does not belong to anyone; the question of "who" owns the forest is not important, as any specific owner will have an interest in coming to an agreement with the resort owner (if such an agreement is mutually beneficial).</p>
