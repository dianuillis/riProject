There are several religious or popular celebrations (the <it>Festa</it>), pilgrimages (<it>romarias</it>) and processions (<it>procissão</it>) in <link>
Póvoa de Varzim</link>, <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. Most of these festivals occur around the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../714/193714.xml">
Holy week</link> or during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../392/29392.xml">

Festival of Saint Peter</st>

The city's municipal holiday is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../842/15842.xml">

's day (<it>Dia de São Pedro</it>), the fisherman saint and the popular patron saint of the city. The Saint Peter festivities stopped in 1892, due to the fishing tragedy that year, but in 1962, the City Hall tried to revive the tradition, and the festival recovered with great success and became the main celebration of the city. In 1974, when the government authorized local holidays, the city hall declared it the municipal holiday.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Around this date, the neighbourhood windows are decorated; and, on the night of 28th to 29th the population gets together in celebration, dancing and eating by the light of fires (fogueiras). The traditional neighbourhoods compete in the "rusgas" (a sort of carnival) and the creation of thrones to Saint Peter. This festival is very important and rivals Christmas and Easter as the event of the year. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

The neighbourhoods competing in the rusgas are Bairro Norte, Bairro Sul, Bairro de Belém, Bairro da Mariadeira, Bairro da Matriz, and Bairro Regufe. The most popular are Norte, Sul and Matriz; but the greatest competition is between Norte (north) and Sul (south). The supporters live not only in the geographical area of the neighbourhood but stretch throughout the city and bordering areas. These days, the population behaves  very much like football supporters, and occasionally there are some disturbances when fans defend their preferred neighbourhood; but the competition is usually very healthy. Families, having previously emigrated to the United States and beyond, have been known to come back to Povoa, time and again, simply to relish the spectacular feelings of excitement and community present at this festival.</p>

Fishing festivals</st>
<p>

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../442/1442.xml">
August 15</link> there is the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../335/259335.xml">
Feast of the Assumption</link></it>, , devotion of Póvoa's fishermen, this is one of the largest festivals of this kind in Portugal, the procession is headed by the Archbishop of Braga and the pinnacle of the procession occurs in front of the seaport, where fireworks are launched from carefully arranged boats.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

Saint's Rock. Near the rock, the Santo André Chapel was built in 16th century; however, this place shows evidence the work of man since, at least, the Roman era.
</caption>
</image>

Two fishing pilgrimages (<it>romarias</it>) are peculiar, as these are associated with the landscape: the <it>Nossa Senhora da Saúde Pilgrimage</it> from the First Church (<it>Igreja Matriz</it>) to Nossa Senhora da Saúde Chapel in the base of São Félix hill, and <it>Santo André Pilgrimage</it>, that goes along the beach to Santo André Chapel.</p>
<p>

São Félix is a reference point for fishermen at sea and of historical importance. On the last Sunday of May, the <it>Pilgrimage of Nossa Senhora da Saúde</it> (Our Lady of Health) covers a distance of 7 kilometres (4.25 mi) between the Igreja Matriz of Póvoa de Varzim and the Nossa Senhora da Saúde Chapel, at the foot of São Félix. Mostly, the worshippers of this saint make promises, notably fishermen of the municipalities of Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde.</p>
<p>

Near Cape Santo André, there is a rocky formation known as <it>Penedo do Santo</it> (Saint's Rock), which has a mark that the Poveiro fishermen believe to be a footprint of <saint wordnetid="110546850" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../008/29008.xml">
Saint Andrew</link></saint>
 (<it>Santo André</it>). They still believe that this saint is the <it>Boatman of Souls</it> and that he frees the souls of those whom drown in the sea, fishing them from the depths of the ocean after a shipwreck. The celebration of Saint Andrew occurs on the dawn of the last day of November, when groups of men and women, wearing black hoods and holding lamps, go to the chapel via the beach, singing and in the end surround the chapel, forming the <it>Ponto das Almas</it> (Souls' Point).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Easter and Anjo</st>
<p>

Easter Monday is 'understood' to be the second "municipal holiday", a tradition from the parish of Argivai (referred to among the people as <it>O Anjo</it>, "The Angel"). The populace works on Good Friday (national holiday) to have Monday free to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../616/247616.xml">
picnic</link>. The local companies follow this tradition and are open on Friday and closed on Monday. In general, the picnic is held in the green area of Argivai, but many travel to other places. The tradition has quickly transferred to neighbouring cities. Easter Sunday is the day of blessing of the homes by the compasso, a group of church members that take the cross of Christ to every home with an open door. On this day, godchildren visit their godparents and different families compete in the <it>Péla</it>, a traditional local game that is played while the population awaits the visit of the compasso.</p>

<st>
Fairs</st>
<p>

In the last fortnight of September, during the Senhora das Dores festival there is the typical Senhora das Dores <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../619/24619.xml">
Pottery</link> Fair, with many different tents, installed in the plaza near the Senhora das Dores Church, which sell diverse wares of special traditional Portuguese pottery. These feasts have roots in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../820/35820.xml">
1768</link>, year when an icon of Mary was placed in the old Chapel of Senhor do Monte. The followers of the sect originated the annual party, procession and fair<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>. </p>
<p>

The <it>HortiPóvoa</it> - the horticultural Fair of Póvoa de Varzim takes place during the summer in Aguçadoura. Every week, on Sundays, there is the <it>Estela Fair</it>, which is a market dedicated to trade of vegetables. Recently, other annual fairs had been established: the <it>Milk Agricultural Fair</it> in São Pedro de Rates, with regional products, such as dairy products, sweets, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/14361.xml">
honey</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../435/6494435.xml">
cured meats</link>, wines and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>; the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/13645.xml">
Horse</link> Fair</it> in Terroso where, besides trading, it is possible to attend horse shows.</p>
<p>

Still, there are other weekly fairs: the <it>Moninhas fair</it> (Monday) and <it>Aver-o-Mar fair</it> (Sunday morning), and also the <it>Antiques Fair</it>, in Praça do Almada, that occurs every second Sunday of the month.</p>
