Cardplay algorithms</st>
<p>

Bridge poses challenges to its players that are different from board games such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/5134.xml">
chess</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../971/64971.xml">
go</link>. Most notably, bridge is a probabilistic game: a bridge player must decide which bid to make and which card to play based on only incomplete information. At the start of a deal, the information available to each player is limited to just his/her own cards. During the bidding and the subsequent play, more information becomes available via the bidding of the other three players at the table, the cards of the partner of the declarer (the dummy) being put open on the table, and the cards played at each trick. However, it is only at the end of the deal that full information is obtained.</p>
<p>

Today's top-level bridge programs deal with this probabilistic nature by generating many samples representing the unknown hands. Each sample is generated at random, but constrained to be compatible with all information available so far from the bidding and the play. Next, the result of different lines of play are tested against optimal defense for each sample. This testing is done utilizing a so-called double-dummy solver that via extensive search algorithms determines the optimum line of play for both parties. The line of play that generates the best score averaged over all samples is selected as the optimal play. </p>
<p>

Efficient double-dummy solvers are key to successful bridge-playing programs. Also, as the amount of computation increases with sample size, techniques such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../671/867671.xml">
importance sampling</link> are used to generate sets of samples that are of minimum size but still representative.</p>

The future</st>
<p>

In comparison to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/68367.xml">
computer chess</link>, computer bridge is in its infancy. Yet, whereas computer chess has taught programmers little about building machines that offer human-like intelligence, more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/4706257.xml">
intuitive</link> and probabilistic games such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../995/3995.xml">
bridge</link> might provide a better testing ground. </p>
<p>

The question whether bridge-playing programs will reach world-class level in the foreseeable future is not easy to answer. Computer bridge has not attracted an amount of interest anywhere near to that of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../367/68367.xml">
computer chess</link>. On the other hand, researchers working in the field have accomplished most of the current progress in the last decade. </p>
<p>

Irrespective of the results of computers against humans in tournament bridge, computer bridge already has changed the analysis of the game. Commercially available double-dummy programs can solve bridge problems in which all four hands are known, typically within a second. These days, few editors of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/5782825.xml">
bridge magazines</link> will solely rely on humans to analyse bridge problems before publications. Also, more and more bridge players and coaches utilize computer analysis in the <it>post-mortem</it> of a match.</p>
