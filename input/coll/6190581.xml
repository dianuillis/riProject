. It began life in 1968 as a copy of IBM's <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">

, which at the time was distributed to IBM customers at no charge, in source code form, without support, as part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../204/7218204.xml">
IBM Type-III Library</link>. Through extensive in-house development, in what today would be termed a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../506/301506.xml">
software fork</link>, National CSS took VP/CSS in a different direction from <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
. Although the two systems would eventually share many capabilities, their technical implementations diverged in substantive ways.<p>

VP/CSS ran on IBM and IBM plug-compatible hardware owned by NCSS (and by a few customers with site licenses, including <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/347756.xml">

 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../749/284749.xml">
Standard Oil of California</link>). After an initial period running on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/7522024.xml">
IBM System/360-67</link> platform used by <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
, VP/CSS was ported to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../785/59785.xml">
System/370</link> series, made possible when IBM added virtual memory capabilities to the S/370 series in 1972. </p>
<p>

VP/CSS was notable for supporting very large numbers of interactive users per machine, when compared with other IBM mainframe operating systems. Technical, operations, and commercial factors all played a role in making National CSS a commercially viable service business.</p>

<sec>
<st>
Architecture</st>
<p>

VP/CSS shared the basic architecture and concepts of <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
, which were revolutionary for their time. A control program (called CP in <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
, VP in VP/CSS) created multiple independent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../353/32353.xml">
virtual machine</link>s (VMs), implementing a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/8273596.xml">
full virtualization</link> of the underlying hardware – meaning that each time-sharing user was provided with a private virtual machine. Each appeared to be an entire, stand-alone computer, capable of running any software that could run on the bare machine, including other operating systems. (This concept was pioneered with IBM's research system <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../207/7506207.xml">
CP-40</link> in the first version of <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
.)</p>
<p>

This design was a departure from IBM's other monolithic operating systems. Isolating users from each other improved system stability: a bug in one user's software could not crash another user's virtual machine, nor the underlying control program. This approach made <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
 a superior choice for commercial time-sharing, and thus a strong foundation for National CSS as it broke new ground in what would become an important new industry.</p>
<p>

Each VM created by VP ran a simple, single-user operating system called CSS, derived from IBM's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/154805.xml">
Cambridge Monitor System</link>. CSS allowed users to run programs, manipulate a file system, and manage virtual devices.</p>
<p>

Since VP and CSS began life as CP and CMS, respectively, they closely resembled these systems, particularly in their early days. Continuous development and introduction of new features in both VP/CSS and IBM's VM led to significant differences over time; but the systems retained an obvious family resemblance.</p>
<p>

IBM's decision to add virtualization and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/32354.xml">
virtual memory</link> features to the S/370 reflects the success of the virtual machine approach to time-sharing. Some credit for this belated decision has been attributed to IBM's awareness of the commercial success of <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">

NCSS enhancements</st>
<p>

In 1968, the founders of National CSS saw that the <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">

 operating system would be a good foundation for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/30958.xml">
time-sharing</link> business – because of the system's technical merits, its ability to share mainframe resources among many interactive users, and its availability in source code form at no cost. Another firm, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/8378851.xml">
Interactive Data Corporation</link>, reached the same conclusion. Each firm lured away key <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">

 technical personnel from CSC, MIT, and <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

. </p>
<p>

National CSS quickly discovered, however, that <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">

 initial performance was not adequate to sustain profitable operations – that, literally, selling every available minute of interactive time would only pay for the $50K/month equipment lease. A crash technical project began to improve performance; this led to a number of fundamental enhancements, and soon allowed the business to make money. Thus began a lengthy reimplementation effort that would occupy a large development team over the course of some fifteen years. At the end of its lifespan, VP/CSS had diverged a long way from its <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
 roots, and boasted a surprising array of features, some of which would be considered quite modern even today.</p>
<p>

Key enhancements to the original <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/315784.xml">
CP/CMS</link></O>
 system included changes in the dispatching algorithm and the paging system. Virtual memory was of course a new concept at the time, and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/7522024.xml">
IBM System/360-67</link> address translation technology (via the "<link>
Blaauw Box</link>") enabled various technical approaches. Ultimately, the VP/CSS page migration algorithm and three-queue dispatcher became well-known, and some NCSS personnel eventually joined IBM's <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

</structure>
 to work on VM technologies.</p>
<p>

Another area for throughput improvement was in the performance of the CSS single-user operating system. One important change was replacing <link>
Channel Command Word</link>s (CCWs) and other expensive simulated instructions with something like what today are termed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../095/1260095.xml">
BIOS call</link>s. Simulating the complex S/360 I/O architecture through virtualization was an amazing feat – done in CP's complex innermost core, in a routine called "CCWTRANS," as I/O operations were trapped within each virtual machine. However, it proved enormously cheaper to make direct <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../216/1267216.xml">
hypervisor</link> calls for targeted functions, rather than simulating the operation of low-level I/O commands. In VP/CSS, this was done using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/1441546.xml">
paravirtualization</link> via the non-virtualized DIAG (diagnose) instruction. The same technique was used by IBM in CP/CMS release 3.1, and carried forward into VM/370. (It is unclear which implementation came first – or whether they were invented independently.)</p>
<p>

Early National CSS technical efforts quickly established VP/CSS as a commercially viable version of CP/CMS. VP/CSS was reputed to have much better performance than IBM's reimplementation of CP/CMS, <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../018/315018.xml">
VM/370</link></O>
 – which in turn was reputed to have a substantial performance advantage over IBM's "preferred" timesharing solution, TSO. Unfortunately, documented period performance statistics are hard to find today. However, there are several data points that support such claims. </p>

The following relative performance is believed to be accurate, although documented sources remain to be located:

</p>
<p>

As described in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../460/8177460.xml">
History of CP/CMS</link>, IBM's primary emphasis on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/19649.xml">
MVS</link> and its successors as its core mainframe operating system led IBM to waste the substantial technical advantage represented by VM/370. This made it possible for an independent vendor like NCSS to strike into new territory. (Industry observers have pointed out that a hardware vendor has a natural preference for selling more hardware than for increasing the number of users per machine.) NCSS gained technical advantages, and ultimately became very successful commercially, despite the fact that the optimization techniques it used to enhance VP and CSS performance were well understood, and well-documented in the literature of the day.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

Ultimately, after <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/483650.xml">

 publicized its sales wins at several large VP/CSS data centers, IBM began to pay more public attention to NCSS and its technical innovations. Not long thereafter, as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../958/30958.xml">
time-sharing</link> industry began to feel pressure from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/18457137.xml">
personal computer</link> revolution, the need for a super-optimized multiuser mainframe operating system waned.</p>

Fate</st>
<p>

NCSS moved away from VP/CSS in the mid 80s, retargeting Nomad for VM and other platforms. It is unknown how long any NCSS site-license customers continued to use VP/CSS on their own equipment (though it seems unlikely any could continue for long without ongoing NCSS operating system support).</p>
