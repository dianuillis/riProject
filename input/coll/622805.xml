<b>Navigational databases</b> are characterized by the fact that objects in the database are found primarily by following references from other objects. Traditionally navigational interfaces are procedural, though one could characterize some modern systems like <standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">
<system_of_measurement wordnetid="113577171" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/19086670.xml">
XPath</link></system_of_measurement>
</standard>
 as being simultaneously navigational and declarative. <p>

Navigational access is traditionally associated with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../098/185098.xml">
network model</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../075/247075.xml">
hierarchical model</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/8377.xml">
database</link> interfaces and have evolved into <link>
Set-oriented</link> systems <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. Navigational techniques use "pointers" and "paths" to navigate among data records (also known as "nodes"). This is in contrast to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/26220.xml">
relational model</link> (implemented in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../873/25873.xml">
relational database</link>s), which strives to use "declarative" or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/17927_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
logic programming</link> techniques in which you ask the system for <it>what</it> you want instead of <it>how</it> to navigate to it.  </p>
<p>

For example, to give directions to a house, the navigational approach would resemble something like, "Get on highway 25 for 8 miles, turn onto Horse Road, left at the red barn, then stop at the 3rd house down the road". Whereas, the declarative approach would resemble, "Visit the green house(s) within the following coordinates...."</p>
<p>

Hierarchical models are also considered navigational because one "goes" up (to parent), down (to leaves), and there are "paths", such as the familiar file/folder paths in hierarchical file systems. In general, navigational systems will use combinations of paths and prepositions such as "next", "previous", "first", "last", "up", "down", etc.</p>
<p>

"Paths" are often formed by concatenation of <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">
<artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/998074.xml">
node</link></artifact>
</structure>
 names or node addresses. Example:</p>
<p>

<image width="250px" src="6n-graf.svg" type="thumb">

</caption>
</image>
</p>
<p>

Node6.Node4.Node5.Node1</p>
<p>

Or</p>
<p>

Node6/Node4/Node5/Node1</p>
<p>

If there is no link between given nodes, then an error condition is usually triggered with a message such as "Invalid Path".  The path "Node6.Node2.Node1" would be invalid in most systems because there is no direct link between Node 6 and Node 2.</p>
<p>

The usage of the term "navigational" allegedly is derived from a statement by <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/301387.xml">
Charles Bachman</link></scientist>
</person>
 in which he describes the "programmer as navigator" while accessing his favored type of database. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362534&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM">

<p>

Except for hierarchical file systems (which some consider a form of database), navigational techniques fell out of favor by the 1980s. However, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../757/22757.xml">
object oriented programming</link> and <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/34138.xml">
XML</link></format>
 have kindled a renewed, but controversial interest in navigational techniques.</p>
<p>

Critics of navigational techniques view them as "unstructured spaghetti messes", and liken them to the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../853/197853.xml">
Go to</link>" of pre-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/27695.xml">
structured programming</link>. In other words, they are allegedly to data organization what go-to's were to behavior flow. In this view, relational techniques provide improved discipline and consistency to data organization and usage because of its roots in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../553/27553.xml">
set theory</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../477/199477.xml">
predicate calculus</link>. </p>
<p>

Some also suggest that navigational database engines are easier to build and take up less memory (RAM) than relational equivalents. However, the existence of relational or relational-based products of the late 1980s that possessed small engines (by today's standards) because they didn't use SQL suggest this is not necessarily the case. Whatever the reason, navigational techniques are still the preferred way to handle smaller-scale structures.</p>
<p>

A current example of navigational structuring can be found in the <standard wordnetid="107260623" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../743/8743.xml">
Document Object Model</link></system_of_measurement>
</standard>
 (DOM) often used in web browsers and closely associated with <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/9845.xml">
JavaScript</link></programming_language>
. The DOM "engine" is essentially a light-weight navigational database. The <invention wordnetid="105633385" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/33139.xml">
World Wide Web</link></invention>
 itself and Wikipedia could even be considered forms of navigational databases. (On a large scale, the Web is a network model and on smaller or local scales, such as domain and URL partitioning, it uses hierarchies.)</p>

<p>

This suggests that the visual nature of navigational structures is another reason for their continued use. The relativistic, multi-dimensional nature of relational data can make it difficult to visually represent. However, defenders of relational will argue that the relativism is part of its power.</p>
