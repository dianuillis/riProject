According to the company, Enterprise Vault is now an integral part of Symantec's 'Information Foundation' suite, which is a drawing together of security and archiving technologies intended to help customers deal with information risk associated with conducting business via email, and "...provides a number of ways to control the flow of data with tools designed to identify, classify, and control corporate data held in databases, e-mails, IM, and file systems. The software can also review, hold, release, and audit e-mail, IM, and Web communications based on pre-determined policies."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>.</p>

History</st>
<p>

Enterprise Vault was originally developed at <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../952/7952.xml">
Digital Equipment Corporation</link></company>
 (DEC) by a group of developers who had previously been the engineering team for Digital's VMS based ALL-IN-1 office and messaging system.  After DEC was acquired by Compaq Computer Corporation the Enterprise Vault team was terminated just after Version 1 of the product was shipped.  The Technical Director, Nigel Dutt, acquired the rights using funding from venture capitalists, and <b>kVault Software Limited</b> was formed late in 1999.  The company would later adopt the name KVS, Inc. when entering the US market.  KVS was led by Mike Hedger as CEO and Nigel Dutt as CTO during archiving's "<book wordnetid="106410904" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../812/243812.xml">
Crossing the Chasm</link></book>
" phase.  The  four years from 2000&ndash;2004 is when great sales and engineering innovation took place, sky-rocketing KVS, Inc. to its acquisition by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../457/438457.xml">
VERITAS Software</link> in 2004<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>.</p>
<p>

Enterprise Vault is now part of Symantec's disconnected "Enterprise Messaging Management" group. Symantec gained its Enterprise Messaging Management (EMM) and storage management capabilities by acquiring VERITAS in 2005<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> (also see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../048/881048.xml">
List of Symantec acquisitions</link>). </p>
<p>

Enterprise Vault software from Symantec provides an archiving framework to enable the discovery of content held within e-mail, file system and collaborative environments, while reducing storage costs and simplifying management, the company says. Enterprise Vault manages content via automated, policy-controlled archiving to online and near-line stores for active retention and seamless retrieval of information according to the Symantec website. The built-in search and discovery capabilities of Enterprise Vault are complemented by specialized client applications for corporate governance, risk management and legal protection.</p>

<p>

<b>Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino Mailbox Archiving</b> 
Enterprise Vault for Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Domino archives individual mailboxes to eliminate quotas, message size restrictions and control message store growth. Admin-defined policies automatically archive email and attachments out of Exchange and into online Enterprise Vault stores. Optionally, shortcuts are left behind allowing users to view or restore the original items through Outlook, Lotus Notes, or via extended web-based search functions.</p>
<p>

<b>Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino Journaling</b> 
Enterprise Vault works with Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Domino journaling in order to satisfy the corporate legal or regulatory retention requirements. Enterprise Vault can be configured to retain a copy of all email messages sent and received, ensuring that they are kept for the appropriate period of time required to meet regulatory or legal retention requirements. </p>
<p>

<b>Microsoft Exchange PST Migrator</b> 
Enterprise Vault software allows organizations to migrate all existing PST file data into the archive repository. Restoring user search and accessibility to this data enables the organization to achieve PST eradication.</p>
<p>

<b>Microsoft Exchange Public Folder Archiving</b> 
Enterprise Vault Public Folder Archiving archives individual public folders in Microsoft Exchange. Optionally, shortcuts are left behind allowing users to view or restore the original items transparently through Outlook or via extended web-based search functions.</p>
<p>

<b>Microsoft Sharepoint Portal Server Archiving</b> 
Enterprise Vault supports archiving content from Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server and SharePoint Portal Server 2003. Fast-growing volumes of intellectual content on SharePoint Portal Server are archived and managed by Enterprise Vault. EV can archive and offload older data to control the storage consumption of the SharePoint Portal Server. Newer, more frequently accessed content is retained within SharePoint with older, less frequently accessed content being moved to Enterprise Vault yet remaining available to the end-user.</p>
<p>

<b>Offline Vault</b> 
Enterprise Vault Offline Vault provides laptop access to archived email even when users are not connected to the corporate network. Enterprise Vault software can be configured to provide users with a local Vault stored on their PC hard drive. When a disconnected user tries to access an archived item via a shortcut, this item will be retrieved from the local Vault, ensuring that they have access to important content wherever it is located. At the same time the user's email is still archived to the corporate archive, so it is not vulnerable to loss or damage.</p>
<p>

<b>SMTP Archiving</b> 
Enterprise Vault 6.0 and above supports policy-based journal archiving of email and attachments in SMTP based email systems.
