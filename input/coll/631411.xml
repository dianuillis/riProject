<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../863/116863.xml">

, one of eleven children. His father, Asa Pratt, was a carpenter. Of modest means, he spent three winters as a student at Wesleyan Academy (Now <private_school wordnetid="108411170" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

<p>

In nearby <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/4309.xml">
Boston, Massachusetts</link></village>
, Pratt joined a company specializing in paints and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/2079074.xml">
whale oil</link> products. In 1850 or 1851, he came to <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/645042.xml">

, where he worked for a similar company. </p>
<p>

Pratt recognized the potential replacement of whale oil with petroleum ("natural oil") distillates for lighting purposes, and he became a pioneer of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../887/994887.xml">
petroleum industry</link> as new wells were established in western Pennsylvania in the 1860s. He soon established his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../992/16992.xml">
kerosene</link> refinery <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../075/1331075.xml">
Astral Oil Works</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../384/47384.xml">
Brooklyn, New York</link>. Pratt's product later gave rise to the slogan, "<it>The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil</it>."</p>

 Henry H. Rogers, Charles Pratt and Company </st>
<p>

In the mid-1860s, Pratt met two aspiring young men, Charles Ellis and <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/424409.xml">

 in the area of the new oil fields of <county wordnetid="108546183" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../924/91924.xml">

 in western Pennsylvania. Previously, Pratt had bought whale oil from Charles Ellis in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/116712.xml">
Fairhaven, Massachusetts</link></village>
, the young men's coastal hometown. They struck a deal and pre sold the entire output of their small venture, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">
<institution wordnetid="108053576" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../642/1284642.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/133967.xml">

 to Pratt's company at a fixed price. </p>
<p>

However, a flaw in the arrangement was that Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt. A few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to try to live up to their fixed price contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus of funds was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt. </p>
<p>

Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Henry Rogers went to Pratt in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/645042.xml">

 and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he immediately hired him for his own organization. Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over fifty thousand dollars a year. Rogers, his wife <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The Rogers family continued to live frugally and young Henry worked very hard. Abbie brought his meals to the "works", and often he would sleep but three hours a night rolled up in a blanket by the side of a still. Rogers moved steadily from foreman to manager, and then superintendent of Pratt's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../075/1331075.xml">
Astral Oil Refinery</link>. True to his word, Pratt soon gave Rogers an interest in the business. In 1867, with Henry Rogers as a partner, he established the firm of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../857/1280857.xml">
Charles Pratt and Company</link>. In the next few year Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt's "hands and feet and eyes and ears" (<it>Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Businessmen</it>, 1909).</p>

 (PRR) and other railroads through a secret system of rebates. Rockefeller and the South Improvement Company scheme outraged independent oil producers in western  Pennsylvania and refineries there and afar alike.      </p>
<p>

The opposition to the South Improvement Company scheme among the New York refiners was led by Rogers. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers, of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../857/1280857.xml">
Charles Pratt and Company</link>, as head, to <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../967/133967.xml">

 to consult with the Oil Producers' Union there. Their arrival in the oil regions was a matter of great satisfaction. </p>
<p>

Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and his associates managed to forge an agreement with the PRR and other railroads whose leaders eventually agreed to open rates to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement. The oil men were most exultant, but their joy was to be short-lived, for Rockefeller had already begun forming his <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/28931.xml">

 organization and was busy trying another approach, which included frequently buying-up opposing interests. </p>
<p>

A short time later, Rockefeller approached Charles Pratt with his plans of cooperation and consolidation. Pratt talked it over with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. <celebrity wordnetid="109903153" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Although the merger deal made him a wealthy man, as a member of the board of directors of Standard Oil, Pratt was a frequent critic of Rockefeller, who was always respectful to him. With Pratt's death in 1891, Rockefeller's position as the most powerful man in the oil industry, already well established, became unassailable. </p>

 soon rose to become one of the key men of Standard Oil, and was a Vice-President by 1890. Rogers, who kept his residence in New York City after moving there at Pratt's request, also invested outside of Standard Oil, and became one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had interests in oil, gas, steel, copper, coal, and railroads, and eventually founded and built the <railway wordnetid="104048568" confidence="0.8">
