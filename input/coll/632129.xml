 History </st>

<p>

ERC was founded in July, 1920 as the <b>American Plan Association of Cleveland</b>. One of the organization’s main goals was to promote <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../606/1149606.xml">
open shop</link> employment instead of the common <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../722/553722.xml">
closed shop</link> practice, which meant an employer was either <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../626/17626.xml">
union</link> or non-union, but could not hire some of each.  Another early goal was to help reduce the number of strikes locally, and the organization claimed it was at least partially responsible for reducing the number of strikes in Cleveland from 41 in 1920 to 21 in 1922.  In 1920 Cleveland had been one of the only large cities in the US without a general employer’s association, yet by 1922 the APA of Cleveland had grown to be one of the largest such organizations in the country.  In 1930 the organization was renamed <b>The Associated Industries of Cleveland</b>, and in 1986 the name <b>Employer's Resource Council</b> was coined.  The organization is now more commonly referred to simply as <b>ERC</b>.</p>
