 History </st>
<p>

Olivo was first planted in 1991 by the Lochie family, and now is owned by the Meehan family. As previously mentioned, it was the pioneering olive grove in the Wairarapa, and also is one of the oldest and most established brands in New Zealand.
Olivo enjoyed a rebranding in 2005 giving the bottles the look they currently have today.</p>

Visitors to Olivo can enjoy a short tour of the grove and a tasting at the newly-built tasting room on weekends, public holidays and at other times by arrangement. Also tour groups are welcome for a small charge (which can include a delicious local morning tea!)</p>
