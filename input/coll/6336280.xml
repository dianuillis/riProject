<b>HIV and AIDS in South Africa</b> are major health concerns, and around 5.5 million people are thought to be living with the virus in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 has more people with HIV/AIDS than any other country.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Although progress has been made in South Africa - a country that has the resources to provide antiretroviral therapy for all of those with advanced disease - the majority of patients who require antiretroviral therapy in South Africa are still not receiving it. As a result, in most hospitals in South Africa it is still common to see patients without access to antiretroviral therapy dying of opportunistic infections including tuberculosis.</p>
<p>

The South African National HIV Survey estimated that 10.8% of all South Africans over 2 years old were living with HIV in 2005. There is an average of almost 1,000 deaths of AIDS a day in South Africa. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> The ASSA2003 model estimates that 345,640 South Africans died of AIDS in 2006.</p>

 Effects </st>
<p>

AIDS is affecting mainly those who are sexually active, which means the demographics of the country are slowly changing. Many deaths are people who are their family's primary wage earners. This is resulting in many 'AIDS orphans' who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> It is estimated that there were 1,400,000 AIDS orphans in South Africa in 2007.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Traditional orphan support systems are being overwhelmed by the large numbers of orphans, placing increased strain on carers, including elders. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> A recent study found that South African families who had lost members to AIDS were more likely to need to forage for firewood for fuel, and wild herbs and insects for food.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

The government has recently, after much delay, devoted substantial resources to fighting the epidemic.  In 2000, <president wordnetid="110468559" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Following their report, the government stated that it continues to base its policy on the premise that the cause of AIDS is indeed HIV.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> The controversy has not abated, and organisations such as the <politics wordnetid="113840719" confidence="0.8">

 continue to mount political and legal challenges to what they claim is the government's slow response to the epidemic. 
Recently, drafts of a new five-year National Strategic AIDS Plan have come closer to being finalized.  The new plans allocate about R45-billion (about 6 billion US Dollars) towards infection prevention, and says nothing of the previous governmental claims that malnutrition played a role in the spread of AIDS.

 Demographics of HIV </st>

<p>

According to the study of The South African Department of Health study, 13.3% of 9,950 Africans that were included in the poll had HIV. Out of 1,173 whites, 0.6% had HIV.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

<st>
1985 First AIDS Advisory Group</st>
<p>

In 1985, a State of Emergency was declared in South Africa as a result of riots and unrest that had arisen in response to Apartheid, the system of racial segregation that had been in place since the 1950s. In the same year, the government set up the country’s first AIDS Advisory Group in response to the increasingly apparent presence of HIV amongst South Africans. The first recorded case of AIDS in South Africa was diagnosed in 1982, and although initially HIV infections seemed mainly to be occurring amongst gay men, by 1985 it was clear that other sectors of society were also affected. Towards the end of the decade, as the abolition of Apartheid began, an increasing amount of attention was paid to the AIDS crisis.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
1990 First National Antenatal Surveys</st>
<p>

In 1990 the first national antenatal survey to test for HIV found that 0.8% of pregnant women were HIV-positive.  It was estimated that there were between 74,000 and 120,000 people in South Africa living with HIV. Antenatal surveys have subsequently been carried out annually.  </p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
1993</st>
<p>

In 1993 the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women was 4.3%. By 1993 the National Health Department reported that the number of recorded HIV infections had increased by 60% in the previous two years and the number was expected to double in 1993. </p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
1995 International AIDS Conference</st>
<p>

The International Conference for People Living with HIV and AIDS was held in South Africa in 1995, the first time that the annual conference had been held in Africa. The then Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, acknowledged the seriousness of the epidemic, and the South African Ministry of Health announced that some 850,000 people - 2.1% of the total population - were believed to be HIV-positive.</p>
<p>

By 1996 the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women was 12.2%. 
By 1997 the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women was 17.0%. 
By 1999 the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women was 22.4%.</p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
2000 AIDS 5 Year Plan</st>
<p>

In 2000 the Department of Health outlined a five-year plan to combat AIDS, HIV and STIs. A National AIDS Council was set up to oversee these developments. But since then, President Mbeki and his administration have been repeatedly accused of failing to respond adequately to the epidemic.  In April 2000 at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, President Mbeki made a speech that avoided reference to HIV and instead focused on the problem of poverty, fuelling suspicions that he saw poverty, rather than HIV, as the main cause of AIDS. President Mbeki defended a small group of dissident scientists who claim that AIDS is not caused by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/14170.xml">
HIV</link>.  </p>

</ss2>

Retrovirals</st>
<p>

President Mbeki's government was applauded by AIDS activists for its successful legal defence against action brought by transnational pharmaceutical companies in April 2001 of a law that would allow cheaper locally-produced medicines.</p>

 and its allies, campaigned for a program to use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/203312.xml">
anti-retroviral medicines</link> to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child; and then for an overall national treatment program for AIDS that included antiretrovirals. In 2002 South Africa's High Court ordered the government to make the drug nevirapine available to pregnant women to help prevent mother to child transmission of HIV. Despite international drug companies offering free or cheap antiretroviral drugs, the Health Ministry remained hesitant about providing treatment for people living with HIV.  In November 2003, the government finally approved a plan to make antiretroviral treatment publicly available. Until 2003, South Africans with HIV who used the public sector health system could get treatment for opportunistic infections they suffered because of their weakened immune systems, but could not get antiretrovirals, designed to specifically target HIV.</p>
