A <b>library technician</b> is trained to perform the day-to-day functions of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/17727.xml">
library</link> and assists <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/518685.xml">
librarians</link> in the acquisition, preparation and organization of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/18985062.xml">
information</link>. They also assist <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../727/17727.xml">
library</link> patrons in finding information. The widespread use of computerized information storage and retrieval systems has resulted in library technicians handling technical services (such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/190871.xml">
cataloguing</link>) that were once performed exclusively by librarians. Because libraries are increasingly using new technologies (such as automated databases, <recording wordnetid="104063868" confidence="0.8">

, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link> and virtual libraries), the role of the library technician is expanding and evolving accordingly.<p>

Library technicians differ from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/250641.xml">
librarians</link> in terms of education and main duties. Library technicians typically require a college library technician diploma, whereas librarians require a master's degree in library science from an accredited university program.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Library technicians are typically graduates of a library technician diploma program from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../696/5696.xml">
community college</link>, four-year college, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/286539.xml">
institute</link>. They could have on-the-job training and/or a certificate, associate degree, or bachelor's degree. Duties can vary with the type and size of the library but can include: cataloguing and classifying of materials, data input to assist in acquiring print and nonprint materials, and circulation procedures. In a larger library, they may be responsible for clerical staff in a certain section or department. In smaller libraries, where the foundations of organization and operation are already established, they may serve as the manager.</p>

Using the latest <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../340/15340.xml">
information technologies</link>, their goal is to bring together people, information and materials and meet the challenges of a constantly changing information environment. Library technicians work in environments as diverse as business corporations, professional firms, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../836/208836.xml">
financial institutions</link>, cultural organizations, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/182010.xml">
public libraries</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../022/28022.xml">
schools</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
