The <b>relevance paradox</b> occurs where individual professionals or  a group of professionals are unaware of certain essential information which would guide them to make better decisions, and help them avoid inevitable, unintended and undesirable consequences. These "professionals" will seek only the information and advice they believe is the bare minimum amount required as opposed to what they actually needed to fully meet their own or the organization's goals.  (It should be observed that it is not a true <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../390/24390.xml">
paradox</link>.)</p>
<p>

For example; civil engineers from the 1950s onwards unwittingly caused a massive  increase in the debilitating water borne infection <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/191304.xml">
schistosomiasis</link> (Bilharzia) for locals as a result of irrigation schemes that lacked simple low cost counter-measures built in, simply because they had no knowledge of these counter-measures. A decade later the UN publishes guidelines explaining these cheap counter measures and how they should be necessary to built-in to the structures of the irrigation schemes.</p>
<p>

The civil engineers were victims of the relevance paradox because they only thought they need to know about concrete, water flows, etc. and not how to restrict velocities to prevent the snail species which carried the disease from multiplying.</p>

 engineers who having spent a fortune on unsuccessfully developing the complex sliding and articulating inside knee joint needed for space suits eventually went to the Tower of London and ruefully copied the armour of Henry the Eighth with just such a joint – stating “we wish we had known about this earlier!”</p>

The relevance paradox can and usually does apply to all professional groups and individuals in numerous ways.</p>
