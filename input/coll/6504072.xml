<b>Lateral media</b> can be seen as any specific technology to promote lateral communication.  A grapevine is in effect lateral communication but is not necessarily a lateral media if there is no technology.  We then can consider informal help networks, email circulation lists, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../178/6453178.xml">
Information Routing Groups</link>, even the Internet as lateral media.</p>
<p>

Various of the great Enlightenment figures could be seen as lateral mediarists in that they wrote and copied ideas amongst the great thinkers of that era, a bit like the Internet but slower and on parchment.</p>

Lateral media assists <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/6479206.xml">

The Internet is largely a lateral media, and likewise <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../178/6453178.xml">
Information Routing Groups</link> (IRGs) which are specifically designed to promote <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/6479206.xml">

The paper reviews developments in the U .S .A. &amp; U .K . in recent years, progressing beyond network analysis to explore the structure &amp; use of networks. The paper seeks to address questions of how to construct multi-actor policy structures, &amp; build networks for particular purposes. Contributory concepts explored included the 'Reticulist', the 'Leader/Co- ordinator', the 'Segmented Polycephalous Network' &amp; the 'Information Routing Group'
