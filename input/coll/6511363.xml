<b>Cumberland High School</b> is a public school located in <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/134323.xml">

. In its current location since 1962, the school currently serves about 1,600 students.</p>

History</st>
<p>

The current building was built in 1962 and renovated in 1973. The town's mayor presented a capital improvement plan for the school in 2002, but funding was limited and residents questioned the project's first phase plans for a wellness center (athletic complex). A few months later, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../344/2517344.xml">
New England Association of Schools and Colleges</link> gave the school until October 2005 to improve the school's facilities and technology or have its accreditation status placed on probation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

A town referendum was held in September 2005 asking voters to approve the town borrowing $30 million to renovate Cumberland High School.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> The referendum's success is credited in part to a student group called Save Our Schools, which had been organized as part of the school's requirement of 15 hours of teacher-supervised service learning.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

The campus is currently undergoing major renovations known as CHS 2010. This project is designed to create a 21st century learning environment on the campus of Cumberland High School.  The Wellness Center, the Fine and Performing Arts Center and the new cafeteria are already completed and open for student use.</p>
<p>

A science and technology building is currently under construction on what was formerly the parking lot. The renovations are to be completed by April 2008, two years ahead of schedule.  This will be an significant upgrade over the old science facilities.</p>
