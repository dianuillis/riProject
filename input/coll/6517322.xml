<b>Lateral diffusion</b> is the process whereby information can be spread from one node in a social network to another, often in a selective way, and can rapidly traverse an entire population, but preferentially to those nodes likely to be interested, or needing to know.<p>

This is similar to how rumours, gossip, jokes, diseases etc. rapidly spread.  But note that each sender-on can be selective: a sender wouldn't necessarily  tell a superior a joke he might not approve of. Senders also tend to pass on information to those who they know from personal experience would be interested or need to know.</p>
<p>

In this way it has been shown that typically no more than 6 intermediaries are likely to link the most extreme chain of lateral diffusion - see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../629/73629.xml">
six degrees of separation</link> even worldwide.</p>

The paper reviews developments in the U .S .A. &amp; U .K . in recent years, progressing beyond network analysis to explore the structure &amp; use of networks. The paper seeks to address questions of how to construct multi-actor policy structures, &amp; build networks for particular purposes. Contributory concepts explored included the 'Reticulist', the 'Leader/Co- ordinator', the 'Segmented Polycephalous Network' &amp; the 'Information Routing Group'
