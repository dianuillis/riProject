Career</st>

<p>

He studied at the prestigious <link>
Escuela Politécnica Military Academy</link>, and earned a scholarship to study medicine at the renowned <link>
Escuela Médico Militar</link> in Mexico City. </p>
<p>

He obtained his Medical Degree (MD) and returned to Guatemala to serve in that country’s Navy.  He was appointed by the Navy as the Port Doctor for the Caribbean ports of Matias de Galvez and Puerto Barrios, and during his time as a doctor in those locations he helped eradicate malaria.  The population in those areas suffered from plasmodium vivax and Falsiparum, which was caused by mosquitoes breeding in the multitude of swamps surrounding the tropical towns.  Dr. Azurdia requested help from the government of Guatemala to perform blood tests on 28,000 local inhabitants, and from the World Health Organization (WHO) to vaccinate the populations, but the source of the infection—the mosquito—had to be destroyed, so he asked the captains of the freighters that visited those ports to donate their old engine oil to the military.  The military, in turn, used the thousands of gallons of oil to create a protective layer of oil that was deposited on the surface water of all the swamps, effectively destroying the mosquito larvae in the area.</p>
<p>

Another serious problem facing the population of the area was the lack of potable water.  Serious gastrointestinal infections affected most of the population.  Dr.Azurdia out of his own initiative wrote to Dr M.G. Candau of the World Health Organization asking for help.  A water purification plant being shipped from Amsterdam to a city in Nigeria was re-routed because of a war in Nigeria, and sent to the Caribbean port in Guatemala instead.  The plant was capable of producing potable water for up to one million people. It also benefited the economy of the ports because potable water was one necessity that was in very short supply in that area of the world and its availability increased the number of ships visiting the port to purchase provisions and water.</p>
<p>

He was appointed Minister of Public Health by the <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 and represented Guatemala in that country for nearly three years with the government of <link>
