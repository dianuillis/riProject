; the age of the pupils range from 11-16, and it does not have a Sixth Form. The head teacher is Mr. Ian Knights.</p>
<p>

The School was visited by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../482/301482.xml">
OFSTED</link> in November 2001, where the quality of teaching received an overall "good" for both Years 7 - 9 and 10 - 11. Since then a number of renovations have taken place, increasing the facilities, and ultimately earning the school its Sports College status, climaxing with the opening of the Sports Complex in 2002. Recent site improvements include a Gymnastics Complex (opened in 2006), a dedicated Humanities (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../350/10772350.xml">
History</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../533/195533.xml">
Religious Education</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/18963910.xml">

Technology</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../839/18839.xml">
Music</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../236/38236.xml">
Drama</link> buildings.
The school has recently rearranged it's tutoring system, and has organised all students and teachers into a pastoral, vertical system. There are now four communities, named after sporting venues throughout the UK. These are Wembley, Wimbledon, Lords and Twickenham. The students assigned to each house have individual ties; Sky blue, purple, yellow and green respectively.</p>

As aforementioned, Wembley students wear a navy blue tie with double sky blue stripes, Wimbledon wear purple, Lords wear yellow and Twickenham wear green. Every teacher assigned to a community wears a specific badge too.
Prior to the pastoral change, a tutor group would consist of approximately 30 same-year students. However, currently, a tutor group consists of five students from each year, totalling 25 students. Every 'mentor group' must have at least one Young Leader in it, of which there are about 60 in total from Year 11.
Furthermore, there are now Sports Young Leaders and Arts Young Leaders, which help out in their respective departments.</p>
