<b>Medical tourism</b> (also called <b>medical travel</b>, <b>health tourism</b> or global healthcare) is a term initially coined by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../759/597759.xml">
travel agencies</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../641/19641.xml">
mass media</link> to describe the rapidly-growing practice of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../747/155747.xml">
travel</link>ing across international borders to obtain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../925/261925.xml">
health care</link>.<p>

Such services typically include elective procedures as well as complex specialized <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../599/45599.xml">
surgeries</link> such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../638/2867638.xml">
joint replacement</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/2830398.xml">
knee</link>/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/1125423.xml">
hip</link>), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../779/804779.xml">
cardiac surgery</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/982883.xml">
dental surgery</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../048/42048.xml">
cosmetic surgeries</link>. However, virtually every type of health care, including psychiatry, alternative treatments, convalescent care and even burial services are available.  As a practical matter, providers and customers commonly use informal channels of communication-connection-contract, and in such cases this tends to mean less regulatory or legal oversight to assure quality and less formal recourse to reimbursement or redress, if needed. A specialized subset of medical tourism is reproductive tourism and reproductive outsourcing,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> which is the practice of traveling abroad to undergo <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../880/57880.xml">
in-vitro fertilization</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/1514981.xml">
surrogate pregnancy</link> and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/1399190.xml">
assisted reproductive technology</link> treatments including freezing embryos for retro-production.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  </p>
<p>

Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> However, accreditation and other measures of quality vary widely across the globe, and there are risks and ethical issues that make this method of accessing medical care controversial.  </p>

The concept of medical tourism is not a new one. The first recorded instance of medical tourism dates back thousands of years to when <ethnic_group wordnetid="107967382" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Description</st>
<p>

Factors that have led to the increasing popularity of medical travel include the high cost of health care, long wait times for certain procedures, the ease and affordability of international travel, and improvements in both technology and standards of care in many countries. </p>
<p>

Medical tourists can come from anywhere in the world, including Europe, the UK, Middle East, Japan, the United States, and Canada. This is because of their large populations, comparatively high wealth, the high expense of health care or lack of health care options locally, and increasingly high expectations of their populations with respect to health care. An authority at the Harvard Business School recently stated that "medical tourism is promoted much more heavily in the United Kingdom than in the United States".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  </p>
<p>

A forecast by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/586015.xml">
Deloitte Consulting</link> published in August 2008 projected that medical tourism originating in the US could jump by a factor of ten over the next decade.  An estimated 750,000 Americans went abroad for health care in 2007, and the report estimated that a million and a half would seek health care outside the US in 2008.  The growth in medical tourism has the potential to cost US health care providers billions of dollars in lost revenue.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

A large draw to medical travel is convenience and speed. Countries that operate public health-care systems are often so taxed that it can take considerable time to get non-urgent medical care. The time spent waiting for a procedure such as a hip replacement can be a year or more in Britain and Canada; however, in Costa Rica, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Cuba, Colombia, Philippines or India, a patient could feasibly have an operation the day after their arrival. In Canada, the number of procedures in 2005 for which people were waiting was 782,936.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

Additionally, patients are finding that insurance either does not cover orthopedic surgery (such as knee/hip replacement) or imposes unreasonable restrictions on the choice of the facility, surgeon, or prosthetics to be used. Medical tourism for knee/hip replacements has emerged as one of the more widely accepted procedures because of the lower cost and minimal difficulties associated with the traveling to/from the surgery. Colombia provides a knee replacement for about $5,000 USD, including all associated fees, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/11632.xml">
FDA</link>-approved prosthetics and hospital stay-over expenses. However, many clinics quote prices that are not all inclusive and include only the surgeon fees associated with the procedure.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

According to an article by the University of Delaware publication, UDaily:</p>

“</col>
<col style="padding:4px 10px;" valign="top">
The cost of surgery in India, Thailand or South Africa can be one-tenth of what it is in the United States or Western Europe, and sometimes even less. A heart-valve replacement that would cost $200,000 or more in the US, for example, goes for $10,000 in India--and that includes round-trip airfare and a brief vacation package. Similarly, a metal-free dental bridge worth $5,500 in the US costs $500 in India, a knee replacement in Thailand with six days of physical therapy costs about one-fifth of what it would in the States, and Lasik eye surgery worth $3,700 in the US is available in many other countries for only $730. Cosmetic surgery savings are even greater: A full facelift that would cost $20,000 in the US runs about $1,250 in South Africa.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></col>

<p>

However, perceptions of medical tourism are not always positive. In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky.  Nonetheless, the number of Americans who are going abroad for health care is increasing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>  In some parts of the world, wider political issues can influence where medical tourists will choose to seek out health care. </p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../673/15150673.xml">
Health tourism provider</link>s have developed as intermediaries to unite potential medical tourists with provider hospitals and other organisations. Companies are beginning to offer global health care options that will enable North American and European patients to access world health care at a fraction of the cost of domestic care. Companies that focus on medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They also help provide resources for follow-up care upon the patient's return.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
 Process </st>

<p>

The typical process is as follows: the person seeking medical treatment abroad contacts a medical tourism provider. The provider usually requires the patient to provide a medical report, including the nature of ailment, local doctor’s opinion, medical history, and diagnosis, and may request additional information. Certified medical doctors or consultants then advise on the medical treatment. The approximate expenditure, choice of hospitals and tourist destinations, and duration of stay, etc., is discussed. After signing consent bonds and agreements, the patient is given recommendation letters for a medical visa, to be procured from the concerned embassy. The patient travels to the destination country, where the medical tourism provider assigns a case executive, who takes care of the patient's accommodation, treatment and any other form of care. Once the treatment is done, the patient can remain in the tourist destination or return home.</p>

International healthcare accreditation</st>
<p>

Because standards are important when it comes to health care, there are parallel issues around medical tourism, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../359/13061359.xml">
international healthcare accreditation</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../013/10013.xml">
evidence-based medicine</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../224/305224.xml">
quality assurance</link>. </p>
<p>

In the United States, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/1644744.xml">
Joint Commission International</link> (JCI) fulfills an accreditation role, while in the UK and Hong Kong, the <structure wordnetid="104341686" confidence="0.8">

 is a key player. The different international healthcare accreditation schemes vary in quality, size, cost, intent and the skill and intensity of their marketing. They also vary in terms of cost to hospitals and healthcare institutions making use of them.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> </p>
<p>

Many international hospitals today see obtaining JCI accreditation as a way to attract American patients.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> Increasingly, some hospitals are looking towards dual international accreditation, perhaps having both JCI to cover potential US clientele and Trent for potential British and European clientele. As a result of competition between clinics for American medical tourists, there have been initiatives to rank hospitals based on patient-reported metrics.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> </p>

Medical tourism carries some risks that locally-provided medical care does not. Some countries, such as India, Malaysia, Costa Rica, or Thailand have very different infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g Hepatitis A, amoebic dysentery, paratyphoid) which could weaken progress, mosquito-transmitted diseases, influenza, and tuberculosis (e.g., 75% of South Africans have latent TB). However, because in poor tropical nations diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including HIV, TB, and typhoid, while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be "rare" in the West.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

The quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. However, JCI and Trent fulfill the role of accreditation by assessing the standards in the healthcare in the countries like India, China and Thailand. Also, travelling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights can be bad for those with heart (thrombosis) or breathing-related problems. Other vacation activities can be problematic as well &mdash; for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they sunburn while healing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>  To minimise these problems, medical tourism patients often combine their medical trips with vacation time set aside for rest and recovery in the destination country.</p>
<p>

Also, health facilities treating medical tourists may lack an adequate complaints policy to deal appropriately and fairly with complaints made by dissatisfied patients.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> </p>
<p>

Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognised by the <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../583/33583.xml">

, and in 2004 it launched the <link>
World Alliance for Patient Safety</link>. This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>

Legal issues</st>
<p>

By traveling outside their home country for medical care, medical tourists may encounter unfamiliar ethical and legal issues.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> The limited nature of litigation in non-US countries is one reason for the lower cost of care overseas. While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for medical malpractice, these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. Should problems arise, patients might not be covered by adequate personal insurance or might be unable to seek compensation via <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/20581.xml">
malpractice</link> lawsuits. Hospitals and/or doctors in some countries may be unable to pay the financial damages awarded by a court to a patient who has sued them, owing to the hospital and/or the doctor not possessing appropriate insurance cover and/or medical indemnity.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> However new insurance products are available that protect the patient should an alleged medical malpractice occur overseas.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref></p>

<st>
Ethical issues</st>
<p>

There can be major ethical issues around medical tourism. For example, the illegal purchase of organs and tissues for transplantation has been alleged in countries such as India<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> and China.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> </p>
<p>

Medical tourism may raise broader ethical issues for the countries in which it is promoted.  For example in India, some argue that a "policy of 'medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses' will lead to a deepening of the inequities" already embedded in the health care system.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref>  In Thailand, in 2008 it was stated that, "Doctors in Thailand have become so busy with foreigners that Thai patients are having trouble getting care".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>

 Employer-sponsored health care in the US </st>
<p>

A few US employers have started offering incentives in their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/1633074.xml">
employee benefit</link> packages such as paying for air travel and waiving out-of-pocket expenses for care outside of the US. For example, in January 2008, Hannaford Bros., a supermarket chain based in Maine, began paying the entire medical bill for employees to travel to Singapore for hip and knee replacements, including travel for the patient and companion.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref>  Other employers have been less public about their benefit changes.</p>
<p>

Medical travel packages can integrate with all types of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../201/490201.xml">
health insurance</link>, including limited benefit plans,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/1184035.xml">
preferred provider organization</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../042/9154042.xml">
 high deductible health plan</link>s.  Insurers are beginning to establish partnerships with overseas health providers to treat their insureds.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref> The article cites a BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina representative who had a colonoscopy at Bumrungrad International Medical Center in Bangkok.</p>
<p>

According to a recent case study interview in The Health Care Globalization Report, a major employee benefits management company, Plan Benefit Services, accompanied a group of employers to Bangkok and Singapore to visit facilities. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref>  This is seen as significant since up to this point, most visitors to foreign hospitals were patients, health plans and medical travel companies.  According to the report, the employers attending were very close to making benefit changes that would incentivize employees to seek care overseas.</p>
<p>

In another publication, Fast Company Magazine, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref> a much lengthier story discusses the globalization of healthcare and how an employee benefits decision-maker for the City of Myrtle Beach fully supports overseas care, having been a patient himself for a colonoscopy.</p>

 has been treating foreign patients for years, especially for cosmetic and eye surgery. Colombia also provides advanced cardiovascular and transplant surgery. What often compels persons to seek transplant surgery offshore is not only cost considerations, but waiting lists (such as in the US) or the lack of an organized organ inventory and donor system in the home country. Colombia has such an organ donor and banking system which makes organs available to foreigners with certain legal restrictions. Orthopedic surgeries, such as knee and hip replacements, are done in Colombia with US-made, (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/11632.xml">
FDA</link>-approved) prosthetics at a fraction of the cost. </p>
<p>

Colombia has many surgeons that have either trained and/or practiced in other countries such as the US and Europe. Salaries for doctors, nurses, and supporting personnel in Colombia are about 20% of US salaries for similar occupations even though they are required to have the same level of education and job skills. Real estate costs related to medical care facilities are also a fraction of what they are in the US</p>
<p>

Like Brazil, ease of travel and relative proximity from the US and Canada is an advantage. Colombia offers cheaper airfares from the US and Canada (and some European countries) than other more-distant destinations, and does not have the visa restrictions of other countries currently in the medical tourism market.  </p>

 leads a group of uninsured American patients to Cuba to obtain more affordable medical treatment.  "Sicko" has greatly increased foreigners' interest in Cuban healthcare.  A recent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../797/607797.xml">
Miami Herald</link> story focused on the high quality of health care that Canadian and American medical tourism patients receive in Cuba.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref></p>
<p>

The Cuban government has developed Cuban medical tourism to generate income for the country.  Residents of Canada, the UK and most other countries can travel to Cuba without any difficulty;  a tourist visa is generally required.  For Americans, however, because of the US trade policy towards Cuba, travelers must either obtain US government approval, or, more frequently, travel to Cuba from Canada, Mexico, the Bahamas, Jamaica or the Dominican Republic. Cuban immigration authorities do not stamp the passports of US visitors so that Americans can keep their travels a private matter.</p>

Mexico</st>
<p>

Americans, particularly those living near the Mexican border, now routinely cross to Mexico for medical care.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref>  Popular specialties include dentristry and plastic surgery. Mexican dentists often charge one-fifth to one-fourth of US prices,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref> while other procedures typically cost a third what they would in the US.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref></p>
<p>

This trend has alarmed American healthcare providers who, fearing a loss of business, warn patients away from Mexico. "The phenomenon has unsettled US-based dentists who tell horror stories of rampant infections, undetected cases of oral cancer and shoddy work south of the border", claims hotly disputed by Mexican dentists. "In Texas, legislators explored the possibility of allowing health maintenance organizations to operate on both sides of the border. However, physicians in south Texas lobbied against the changes, arguing that local doctors could not compete with the lower costs in Mexico".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref> US doctors point out that the Mexican legal system makes it almost impossible to sue Mexican doctors for malpractice.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref> </p>
<p>

However, many who travel to Mexico for care report that they are satisfied.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref> According to a report commissioned by Families U.S.A., a Washington advocacy group for health-care issues, "About 90 percent [feel] the care they had received in Mexico had been good or excellent. About 80 percent rated the care they had received in the United States as good or excellent".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref> </p>
<p>

Indeed "some U.S. dentists ... have conceded to the competition and begun a 'reverse migration' opening offices in Mexico to take advantage of lower costs".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref>  More American insurers are providing coverage for travelers, as the out-of-pocket costs to them are much lower. "With healthcare costs in the United States continuing to rise, many employers in Southern California are turning to insurance plans that send their workers to Mexico for routine care, plans that are growing by nearly 3,000 people a year".  </p>
<p>

In addition to dental and plastic surgery, Mexican hospitals are popular for bariatric surgery for weight loss, considered an elective procedure that is not covered by some US insurers. A popular bariatric procedure, lap band surgery, which was approved by the FDA in the US in 2001, has been performed for longer by Mexican surgeons.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref></p>

, health and medical tourism is growing rapidly.  Factors drawing medical tourists include Panama's tourist appeal, position as a hub for international travel, and use of the American dollar as the official currency.  Many of Panama’s doctors are bilingual, board certified, and accustomed to working with the same medical equipment and technology used in the United States and Europe. On most procedures, Panama offers savings of more than 50% compared to the US and Europe. For example, Dental implants cost an average of $2,500 per implant  in the US or Canada. In Panama, the same procedure with board and lodging, personal tour guide, and transportation is available at a much lower cost.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

Popular procedures include dental implants, plastic surgery, assisted reproduction, cardiology, cosmetic dentistry, pulmonology and orthopedics. Panama's hospitals have affiliations to international organizations such as: Baptist Health International of Miami, Cleveland Clinic, Tulane Health Science Center, Johns Hopkins International, Miami Children's Hospital, University of Nebraska Medical Center, The Kendall Medical Center in Florida, and Harvard Medical Faculty and Physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in US.

The country has excellent hospitals, English is widely spoken, and many staff have been trained to a high level in the UK or in the US.  There is a highly active Association for Private Hospitals of Malaysia working to develop medical tourism.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2259%22])">59</ref> However, while Malaysia has a national accreditation scheme (MSQH), few of Malaysia's hospitals currently hold international healthcare accreditation, whether British, American or Australian.</p>

 is a relatively new player to the medical travel market, focusing on non-acute surgical procedures and fertility treatment.  Like other Commonwealth countries, New Zealand's medical system is based on the British health system. Most of its specialist physicians have received training in New Zealand and the US or the UK, and all use English as their first language. The costs of private healthcare are significantly cheaper than the US or the UK, with packages (airfare, accommodation, medical service etc) for procedures like hip replacement, or coronary artery bypass costing in total approximately 40% of the procedure cost alone in the US. Many private hospitals in New Zealand are accredited by the national accreditation agency Quality Health New Zealand (QHNZ). QHNZ, like JCI, is a member of the International Society for Quality in healthcare or ISQua.</p>

 has been growing as a destination for medical tourism.  Procedures can be performed at a fraction of the amount that a patient would spend on the same procedure in the US or Europe.  Philippine medical and nursing curricula are more challenging than in many in Southeast Asia, and many Filipino doctors have acquired their postgraduate or fellowship training from well-known institutions in the US, the UK and other developed countries. </p>

Medical centers in Metro Manila have complied to ISO standards, and are periodically and regularly undergo accreditations from Philippine's Department of Health. Others have already accredited by the American accreditation group Joint Commission International (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/1646320.xml">

"SingaporeMedicine"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2262%22])">62</ref> is a multi-agency government-industry partnership committed to strengthening Singapore's position as a medical hub and promoting Singapore as a destination for advanced patient care. Patients come from neighboring countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, and patient numbers from Indochina, South Asia, the Middle East and Greater China are growing. Patients from developed countries such as the United States and the UK are also beginning to choose Singapore as their medical travel destination for relatively affordable health care services in a clean cosmopolitan city.</p>

<p>

The Taiwanese government has declared its determination for the country to become a medical tourism center. To encourage the development of medical tourism, the Council for Economic Planning and Development, together with the Department of Health, proposed the “Medical Service Internationalization Flagship Program”. It is estimated that the government will contribute NT$44.4 million to construct a platform for the collaboration of the government and the medical sector in promoting medical tourism.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2263%22])">63</ref></p>

 was the first Asian country to perform liver transplant surgery successfully and is one of the top five liver transplant centers in Asia. The survival rate is the highest in the world. Taiwan also has one of the three largest bone marrow donor databases in Asia and has several successful cases of international matching. In addition, Taiwan has won a key position in the field of reconstructive and plastic surgery.</p>
<p>

Costs for procedures remain comparatively  low. For example, the charge for assisted reproduction in Taiwan is about one-tenth of that in the US, and the surgery fee for liver transplant is about one-sixth that in the US. The surgery fee for hip joint replacement is even lower than in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Charges for other medical treatments in Taiwan, such as laser eye surgery, health examination, cancer screening, cosmetic surgery and dental treatment, are also competitive.</p>
