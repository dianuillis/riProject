In 2005, the hospital admitted 11,881 in-patients (a 7.4 increase over the previous year) and 178,021 out-patients, according to one source<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>, although the hospital itself puts the 2005 "outpatient volume" at "404,834 visits, for a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> The percentage of patients from New York state has grown from 15.7 percent in 1998 to nearly 40 percent in 2006.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>

History</st>

<p>

After being chartered in 1903, the hospital began service on September 12, 1906 in the Octagon House on Milbank Avenue with four attendings, ten consulting doctors, two nursing staff and seven student nurses.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> At that time the hospital had 24 beds.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

In 1914 Commodore Elias C. Benedict, a town resident, offered to partly finance the building of a new hospital building on Perryridge Road. The first building was felt by many to be inadequate. One of the people influential in suggesting the gift to Benedict was Luke Vincent Lockwood, Benedict's lawyer and a close friend of hospital founder Dr. Fritz Carleton Hyde. Initially, there was public resistance to the proposed building, with some saying it was too big for the community. Construction was delayed by World War I, but by October 1917 the new facility was opened, in time to be used in the serious influenza epidemic the following year.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

Growing demand for hospital services meant that a new building was opened on Perry Lane  on May 5, 1951. Over the years new wings were added to that building, with the last addition being the South Wing in 1965.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  </p>
<p>

In 1998, the hospital affiliated itself with the Yale-New Haven Health System.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> </p>
<p>

Again the hospital outgrew its building, and a campaign was started to finance a new building. Groundbreaking took place in 1997 and in 1999 the new hospital building opened.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

In the fall of 2005, Greenwich Hospital completed construction on its main campus with the opening of the Thomas and Olive C. Watson Pavilion. The Leona and Harry B. Helmsley Medical Building, the hospital's main building, opened in 1999. A 10-year building program was to come to an end in September 2006 with the scheduled dedication of the Carl and Dorothy Bennett Garden at the southern end of the hospital's main campus.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

In November 2007 the hospital applied to the state for permission to offer hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The hospital planned to buy two oxygen chambers for $267,000 and spend an additional $775,000 in construction for the program. A detailed certificate of need was to be submitted to the state Office of Health Care Access between February 3 and April 3, 2008. <hospital wordnetid="103540595" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
