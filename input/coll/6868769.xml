The Fraternity has in recent years won acclaim as a model student organization, garnering among others, the Ten Accomplished Youth Organizations of the Philippines (TAYO) citation in 2004.<p>

The fraternity was first mentioned in the Philippine Collegian on November 1933 as the "first and only medical students' fraternity."

<p>

The Coat of Arms is composed of a golden syringe with the wings of Mercury and two sacred snakes of Aesculapius near the handle.</p>
<p>

The Greek letters MΣΦ (Roman - M, S, F for Medical Students' Fraternity) in respective green, red, green fields are found on the body of the syringe.</p>
<p>

The Roman letters U and P (University of the Philippines) are in its left and right side respectively, with the numbers 1933 at the tip, the year of its founding.  </p>

 The Service Arm of the Fraternity </st>

<p>

Being a fraternity of medical students, the Mu Sigma Phi has developed a tradition of service. This parallels the College of Medicine's vision of a medical education "directed to the underserved". Less than two years after its inception, Mu put together a fund for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../190/3092190.xml">

 (PGH). These projects, notably the Mu Blood Bank and the Mu Eye Bank, were turned over to the College. To facilitate access of indigent patients of the PGH to free medicines, Mu put up a 'Charity Medical Bag' in 1956. </p>
<p>

In line with the College's emphasis on community medicine, Mu has adopted several communities since the 1970s. Mu contributes medical and educational assistance to these areas through medical missions, public health seminars, and the training of local health workers.</p>
<p>

Several organizations, including the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/23444.xml">
Philippine government</link>, have recognized the efforts of Mu Sigma Phi in socio-civic work. In 1997, the Presidential Commission for Urban Poor cited the Fraternity as its "Most Active NGO Partner in <island wordnetid="109316454" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. The Committee of Health of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../521/299521.xml">
Philippine Senate</link>, for its part, declared Mu to be the "Best Community Oriented Student Organization" in 2002. Recently, the Mu Sigma Phi was named as the 2007 Most Outstanding Student Organization in the University of the Philippines-Manila after also being bestowed the same honor the previous year.</p>
<p>

Today, service activities of the Fraternity include medical missions, blood-letting drives, benefit concerts, and working trips to its adopted communities. These are usually held on Saturday and Sundays as the undergraduate brods have classes from Monday to Friday. Major medical missions are occasionally held during summer and semestral breaks.</p>
