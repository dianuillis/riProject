<b>Fiscal incidence</b> is a concept within <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../515/268515.xml">
public finance</link>, a sub-discipline within <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../223/9223.xml">
economics</link>, that refers to the combined overall economic impact of both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../229/12229.xml">
government</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
taxation</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../789/166789.xml">
expenditure</link>s on the real economic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/15037.xml">
income</link> of individuals. While taxation reduces the economic well-being of individuals, government expenditures raise their economic well-being. Fiscal incidence is the term for the overall impact of government taxing and spending considered together.

 Theory</st>
<p>

In theory, governments withdraw resources from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/37235.xml">
society</link> in the form of taxation, and contribute resources back into society in the form of expenditures. However, the burdens of taxation are not borne equally by individuals, and the benefits of government expenditures are not distributed equally throughout society. As a result, the distribution of tax burdens and government expenditure benefits is an important economic question to those concerned with the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../282/1417282.xml">
equity</link> of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/132645.xml">
fiscal</link> system. When the economic incidence of taxation is combined with the economic incidence of government expenditures, the result is a measure of the overall increase or decrease in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/438566.xml">
welfare</link> that individuals enjoy from the state's taxing and spending policies. This is referred to as <b>fiscal incidence</b>.</p>

 Empirical literature </st>
<p>

Early empirical studies of fiscal incidence date to the 1940s. Two early studies included Charles Stauffacher's (1941) study of the United States from 1930-39, and Tibor Barna's (1945) study of the United Kingdom for 1937. Both studies identified substantial income redistribution with Stauffacher concluding that the lowest income group received 27 percent of federal spending between 1930-39 while paying 5 percent of federal taxes. Barna's conceptual framework -- first developed as a doctoral candidate at the <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 under <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../762/196762.xml">
Nicholas Kaldor</link> -- was influential and today serves as the essential framework for fiscal incidence studies conducted by the British government.</p>

local</link> tax systems are combined with progressive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../149/195149.xml">
federal</link> taxes, the result is mildly progressive overall. On the spending side, early results illustrated that the distribution of expenditure benefits as a percentage of income was progressive as well, making the overall fiscal system more progressive that is apparent from the tax system alone. As a result, early studies found that overall fiscal incidence resulted in a net <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/559320.xml">
redistribution</link> of income between income groups within the United States, from higher-income individuals to lower-income individuals. Here the term "progressive" refers to benefits accruing to lower-income individuals as opposed to those with higher incomes; "regressive" conversely refers to benefits accruing to higher-income individuals as opposed to those with lower incomes. The neutrality of these terms has been debated, but they are widely used in economic literature.</p>

In the mid-1960s, two major studies established an approach that was often replicated in the following decades. W. Irwin Gillespie of the <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 (1965) and George A. Bishop of the <organization wordnetid="108008335" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/947890.xml">
Tax Foundation</link></organization>
 (1967) published extensive studies of U.S. taxes and spending for 1960 and 1961-65, respectively. Gillespie criticized previous literature for its limited scope and inadequate incidence analyses. Bishop departed from previous literature as well, basing tax and spending allocations on a single, consistent household survey -- the <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which was relatively new at the time -- and developing a broad income concept rooted in the framework of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/993976.xml">
National Income and Product Accounts</link>. Both studies found that the U.S. tax system was roughly proportional overall and mildly progressive over some ranges, while the distribution of expenditure benefits was sharply progressive, resulting a progressive overall distribution of fiscal incidence for 1961 and 1965. </p>
<p>

The results of Bishop's 1967 study were replicated subsequently by several academics, such as Morgan Reynolds and Eugene Smolensky (1977), and were also utilized as the source data in a study in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../388/24388.xml">
political science</link> literature, <it>The Politics of Redistribution</it> (1970) by Brian R. Fry and Richard F. Winters. Additionally, they prompted a 1970 critical response by H. Aaron and M. McGuire in <it><work wordnetid="104599396" confidence="0.8">

In the 1990s a branch of fiscal incidence known as "benefit incidence analysis" grew in popularity. Largely pioneered by researchers at the <institute wordnetid="108407330" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/33309.xml">

</institute>
, this approach focused narrowly on the distributional impact of education, health and transfer spending programs. Benefit incidence analyses typically provide detailed estimates of whether poverty-reducing programs -- particularly in developing countries -- reach targeted populations. Much of the literature is summarized in Thomas Selden and Michael Wasylenko (1992) and Dominique van de Walle (1996). Benefit incidence studies typically find spending on health, education and transfer payments to be strongly progressive, while finding mixed results on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../297/30297.xml">
tax</link> progressivity in different countries.</p>
<p>

In some countries, official government agencies produce official studies of fiscal incidence to assist lawmakers in the design of tax and spending policies. For example, the <work wordnetid="100575741" confidence="0.8">
