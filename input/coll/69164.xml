<p>

EPOC16, originally simply named EPOC, is the operating system developed by Psion in the late 1980s and early 1990s for Psion's "SIBO" (SIxteen Bit Organisers) devices. All EPOC16 devices feature an <chip wordnetid="103020034" confidence="0.8">

16-bit</link> architecture. EPOC16 is a single-user pre-emptive multitasking operating system, written in Intel 8086 assembler language and C and designed to be delivered in ROM.

In the late 1990s the operating system was referred to as <b>EPOC16</b> to distinguish it from Psion's new EPOC32 OS.</p>

<p>

The first version of EPOC32, Release 1 appeared on the Psion <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../001/492001.xml">
Series 5</link> ROM v1.0 in 1997. Later, ROM v1.1 featured Release 3 (Release 2 was never publicly available.) These were followed by the <it>Series 5mx</it>, <it><artifact wordnetid="100021939" confidence="0.8">

 / <it>netBook</it> and <it>netPad</it> (which all featured Release 5).</p>
<p>

The EPOC32 operating system, at the time simply referred to as EPOC, was later renamed Symbian OS. Adding to the confusion with names, before the change to Symbian, EPOC16 was often referred to as SIBO to distinguish it from the "new" EPOC. Despite the similarity of the names, EPOC32 and EPOC16 were completely different operating systems, EPOC32 being written in C++ from a new codebase with development beginning during the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>

EPOC32 is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../566/2204566.xml">
pre-emptive multitasking</link>, single user operating system with memory protection, which encourages the application developer to separate their program into an engine and an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../249/45249.xml">
interface</link>. The Psion line of PDAs come with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/12293.xml">
graphical user interface</link> called <link>
EIKON</link> which is specifically tailored for handheld machines with a keyboard (thus looking perhaps more similar to desktop GUIs than palmtop GUIs). However, one of EPOC's characteristics is the ease with which new GUIs can be developed based on a core set of GUI classes, a feature which has been widely explored from <link>
Ericsson R380</link> and onwards.</p>
<p>

EPOC32 was originally developed for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../558/60558.xml">
ARM family</link> of processors, including the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../623/1625623.xml">

, but can be compiled towards target devices using several other processor types.</p>

During the development of EPOC32, Psion planned to license EPOC to third-party device manufacturers, and spin off its software division as Psion Software. One of the first licensees was the short-lived <it>Geofox</it>, which halted production with less than 1,000 units sold. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../424/9424.xml">
Ericsson</link></company>
 marketed a rebranded Psion Series 5mx called the <it>MC218</it>, and later created the EPOC Release 5.1 based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../079/167079.xml">
smartphone</link>, the <it>R380</it>. <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../540/7777540.xml">

 also released a budget EPOC device, the <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../901/2861901.xml">
Osaris</link></it> (notable as the only EPOC device to ship with Release 4).</p>

In June 1998, Psion Software became <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../446/72446.xml">
Symbian</link>, a major joint venture between Psion and phone manufacturers <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
