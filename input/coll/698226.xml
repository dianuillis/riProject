A <b>concept map</b> is a diagram showing the relationships among concepts.  Concepts are connected with labeled arrows, in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts is articulated in linking phrases, e.g., "gives rise to", "results in", "is required by," or "contributes to". <it>Concept mapping</it> is a technique for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../850/660850.xml">
visualizing</link> the relationships among different <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../978/6978.xml">

The technique of concept mapping was developed by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/18649220.xml">
Joseph D. Novak</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> and his research team at <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students. It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. </p>
<p>

Concept maps have their origin  in the learning movement called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../161/1040161.xml">
constructivism</link>. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge. </p>
<p>

assimilation theory</link>), who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn new concepts.

"The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>
</indent>

Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" </p>
<p>

In his book <it>Learning How to Learn</it>, Novak states that "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."</p>

Usage</st>
<p>

Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/142910.xml">
creativity</link>. For example, concept mapping is sometimes used for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../081/399081.xml">
brain-storming</link>. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.  </p>
<p>

Formalized concept maps are used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/223325.xml">
software design</link>, where a common usage is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../169/32169.xml">
Unified Modeling Language</link> diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.</p>
<p>

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../681/49681.xml">
ontology</link>-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument.</p>
<p>

Concept maps are widely used in education and business for:

Contrast with mind mapping</st>
<p>

Concept mapping can be contrasted with the similar idea of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/19688.xml">
mind mapping</link>, which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/41821.xml">
tree structure</link>s. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, organizations, concept mapping, as developed by Novak is unique in philosophical basis, which "makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

There is research evidence that knowledge is stored in the brain in the form of productions that act on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../295/8295.xml">
declarative memory</link> content which is also referred to as chunks or propositions <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>. Because concept maps are constructed to reflect the organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.</p>
<p>

Concept maps were developed to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences. A well made concept map grows within a <it>context frame</it> defined by an explicit "focus question," while a mind map often has only branches radiating out from a central picture.</p>
<p>

Another contrast between Concept mapping and Mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a Mind map is created. A Mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming.  A Concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts.  Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mindmaps which fix on a single conceptual center.</p>
