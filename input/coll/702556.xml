<b>Bit time</b> is a concept in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../592/4122592.xml">
computer networking</link>. It is defined as the time it takes for one bit to be ejected from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../613/243613.xml">
Network Interface Card</link> (NIC) operating at some predefined standard speed, such as 10 Mbit/s. The time is measured between the time the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../459/145459.xml">
logical link control</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../949/152949.xml">
layer 2</link> sublayer receives the instruction from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> until the bit actually leaves the NIC. It is important to note that the bit time has nothing to do with the time it takes for a bit to travel on the network medium, but has to do with the internals of the NIC.<p>

To calculate the bit time at which a NIC ejects bits, use the following:</p>
<p>

bit time = 1 / NIC speed</p>
<p>

To calculate the bit time for a 10 Mbit/s NIC, use the formula as follows:</p>
<p>

bit time = 1 / (10 * 10^6)
= 10^-7
= 100 * 10^-9
= 100 nanoseconds</p>
<p>

The bit time for a 10 Mbit/s NIC is 100 nanoseconds. That is, a 10 Mbit/s NIC can eject 1 bit every 100 nanoseconds.</p>
<p>

Bit time is distinctively different from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/507138.xml">
slot time</link>, which is the time taken for a pulse to travel through the longest permitted length of network medium.</p>
