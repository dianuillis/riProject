<b>Affiliate marketing</b> is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/14539.xml">
Internet</link>-based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/59252.xml">
marketing</link> practice in which a business rewards one or more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/17828038.xml">
affiliates</link> for each visitor or customer brought about by the affiliate's marketing efforts.</p>
<p>

Affiliate marketing is also the name of the industry where a number of different types of companies and individuals are performing this form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/1618177.xml">
Internet marketing</link>, including <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/7107455.xml">
affiliate networks</link>, affiliate management companies, and in-house <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/5802307.xml">
affiliate manager</link>s, specialized third party <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/14103070.xml">
vendors</link>, and various types of affiliates/publishers who promote the products and services of their partners.</p>
<p>

Affiliate marketing overlaps with other Internet marketing methods to some degree, because affiliates often use regular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../861/2861.xml">
advertising</link> methods. Those methods include organic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../946/187946.xml">
search engine optimization</link>, paid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../074/2111074.xml">
search engine marketing</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../759/1101759.xml">
e-mail marketing</link>, and in some sense <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/646645.xml">
display advertising</link>. On the other hand, affiliates sometimes use less orthodox techniques, such as publishing reviews of products or services offered by a partner.</p>
<p>

Affiliate marketing—using one website to drive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/856845.xml">
traffic</link> to another—is a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../177/1618177.xml">
online marketing</link>, which is frequently overlooked by advertisers. While <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/4059023.xml">

 capture much of the attention of online retailers, affiliate marketing carries a much lower profile. Still, affiliates continue to play a significant role in <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.8">

History</st>

<ss1>
<st>
Origin</st>
<p>
 
The concept of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/3134240.xml">
revenue sharing</link>—paying <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/146711.xml">
commission</link> for referred business—predates affiliate marketing and the Internet. The translation of the revenue share principles to mainstream <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../611/9611.xml">
e-commerce</link> happened almost four years after the origination of the <invention wordnetid="105633385" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/33139.xml">
World Wide Web</link></invention>
 in November 1994. </p>
<p>

The consensus of marketers and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../596/29596.xml">
adult industry</link> insiders is that Cybererotica was either the first or among the early innovators in affiliate marketing with a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../004/1545004.xml">
cost per click</link> program.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

During November 1994, <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../688/1918688.xml">
CDNOW</link></company>
 launched its BuyWeb program. With this program CDNOW was the first non-adult website to introduce the concept of an affiliate or associate program with its idea of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../584/2064584.xml">
click-through</link> purchasing. CDNOW had the idea that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors may be interested in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take the visitor directly to CDNOW to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose because of conversations with music label <label wordnetid="107202579" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../975/54975.xml">
Geffen Records</link></label>
 in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CDs directly from its website, but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNOW if it could design a program where CDNOW would handle the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../325/7577325.xml">
order fulfillment</link>. Geffen realized that CDNOW could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNOW home page and going directly to an artist's music page.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

 (Amazon) launched its associate program in July 1996. Amazon associates could place <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/34044.xml">
banner</link> or text links on their site for individual books, or link directly to the Amazon home page.</p>
<p>

When visitors clicked from the associate's website through to Amazon and purchased a book, the associate received a commission. Amazon was not the first merchant to offer an affiliate program, but its program was the first to become widely-known and serve as a model for subsequent programs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

In February 2000, Amazon announced that it had been granted a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../273/23273.xml">
patent</link> (6,029,141) on all the essential components of an affiliate program. The patent application was submitted in June 1997, which predates most affiliate programs, but not PC Flowers &amp; Gifts.com (October 1994), AutoWeb.com (October 1995), Kbkids.com/BrainPlay.com (January 1996), EPage (April 1996), and several others.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Compensation methods</st>

Compensation methods</link></it>
</indent>

</p>
<ss1>
<st>
Predominant compensation methods</st>
<p>

Eighty percent of affiliate programs today use revenue sharing or cost per sale (CPS) as a compensation method, nineteen percent use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../819/1549819.xml">
cost per action</link> (CPA), and the remaining programs use other methods such as cost per click (CPC) or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/1874573.xml">
cost per mille</link> (CPM).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Diminished compensation methods</st>
<p>

Less than one percent of traditional affiliate marketing programs today use cost per click and cost per mille. However, these compensation methods are used heavily in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/646645.xml">
display advertising</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../328/2963328.xml">
paid search</link>.</p>
<p>

Cost per mille requires only that the publisher make the advertising available on his website and display it to his visitors in order to receive a commission. Pay per click requires one additional step in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../902/246902.xml">
conversion</link> process to generate revenue for the publisher: A visitor must not only be made aware of the advertisement, but must also click on the advertisement to visit the advertiser's website.</p>
<p>

Cost per click was more common in the early days of affiliate marketing, but has diminished in use over time due to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../806/1012806.xml">
click fraud</link> issues very similar to the click fraud issues modern search engines are facing today. Contextual advertising programs such as Google AdSense are not considered in the statistic pertaining to diminished use of cost per click, as it is uncertain if contextual advertising can be considered affiliate marketing.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Performance marketing</st>
<p>

In the case of cost per mile/click, the publisher is not concerned about a visitor being a member of the audience that the advertiser tries to attract and is able to convert, because at this point the publisher has already earned his commission. This leaves the greater, and, in case of cost per mille, the full risk and loss (if the visitor can not be converted) to the advertiser.</p>
<p>

Cost per action/sale methods require that referred visitors do more than visit the advertiser's website before the affiliate receives commission. The advertiser must convert that visitor first. It is in the best interest for the affiliate to send the most closely-targeted traffic to the advertiser as possible to increase the chance of a conversion. The risk and loss is shared between the affiliate and the advertiser.</p>
<p>

Affiliate marketing is also called "performance marketing", in reference to how sales employees are typically being compensated. Such employees are typically paid a commission for each sale they close, and sometimes are paid performance incentives for exceeding targeted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/1432784.xml">
baselines</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> Affiliates are not employed by the advertiser whose products or services they promote, but the compensation models applied to affiliate marketing are very similar to the ones used for people in the advertisers' internal sales department.</p>
<p>

The phrase, "Affiliates are an extended sales force for your business", which is often used to explain affiliate marketing, is not completely accurate. The primary difference between the two is that affiliate marketers provide little if any influence on a possible prospect in the conversion process once that prospect is directed to the advertiser's website. The sales team of the advertiser, however, does have the control and influence up to the point where the prospect signs the contract or completes the purchase.</p>

</ss1>

<sec>
<st>
Multi-tier programs</st>
<p>

Some advertisers offer multi-tier programs that distribute commission into a hierarchical referral network of sign-ups and sub-partners. In practical terms, publisher "A" signs up to the program with an advertiser and gets rewarded for the agreed activity conducted by a referred visitor. If publisher "A" attracts publishers "B" and "C" to sign up for the same program using his sign-up code, all future activities performed by publishers "B" and "C" will result in additional commission (at a lower rate) for publisher "A". </p>
<p>

This system rewards a chain of hierarchical publishers who may or may not know of each others' existence, yet generate income for the higher level sign-up. This sort of structure has been implemented successfully by a company called <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Two-tier programs exist in the minority of affiliate programs; most are simply one-tier. Referral programs beyond two-tier involve <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/10447140.xml">
multi-level marketing</link> (MLM) or network marketing. </p>
<p>

Even though Quixtar's compensation plan involves network marketing that may not be considered to be affiliate marketing, the leading partners in the company are considered to be and call themselves affiliates. Therefore, one may argue that Quixtar is the affiliate marketer for its partner corporation.</p>

Pros and cons</st>
<p>

Merchants favor affiliate marketing because in most cases it uses a "pay for performance" model, meaning that the merchant does not incur a marketing expense unless results are accrued (excluding any initial setup cost).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Some businesses owe much of their success to this marketing technique, a notable example being Amazon.com. Unlike <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/646645.xml">
display advertising</link>, however, affiliate marketing is not easily <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../529/185529.xml">

Implementation options</st>
<p>

Some merchants run their own (i.e., in-house) affiliate programs using popular software while others use third-party services provided by intermediaries to track traffic or sales that are referred from affiliates (<it>see</it> <occupation wordnetid="100582388" confidence="0.8">

Successful affiliate programs require significant work and maintenance. Having a successful affiliate program is more difficult than when such programs were just emerging. With the exception of some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../536/1562536.xml">
vertical markets</link>, it is rare for an affiliate program to generate considerable revenue with poor management or no management (i.e., "auto-drive").</p>
<p>

Uncontrolled affiliate programs did—and continue to do so today—aid rogue affiliates, who use <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../368/28368.xml">
spamming</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../608/1308608.xml">

typosquatting</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> and other unethical methods that have given affiliate marketing a negative reputation.</p>
<p>

The increased number of Internet businesses and the increased number of people that trust the current technology enough to shop and do business online allows further maturation of affiliate marketing. 
The opportunity to generate a considerable amount of profit combined with a crowded marketplace filled with competitors of equal quality and size makes it more difficult for merchants to be noticed. In this environment, however, being noticed can yield greater rewards.</p>
<p>

Recently, the Internet marketing industry has become more advanced. In some areas online media has been rising to the sophistication of offline media, in which advertising has been largely professional and competitive. There are significantly more requirements that merchants must meet to be successful, and those requirements are becoming too burdensome for the merchant to manage successfully in-house. An increasing number of merchants are seeking alternative options found in relatively new outsourced (affiliate) program management (OPM) companies, which are often founded by veteran <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/5802307.xml">
affiliate managers</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../455/7107455.xml">

Publisher recruitment</st>
<p>

Affiliate networks that already have several advertisers typically also have a large pool of publishers. These publishers could be potentially recruited, and there is also an increased chance that publishers in the network apply to the program on their own, without the need for recruitment efforts by the advertiser. </p>
<p>

Relevant websites that attract the same target audiences as the advertiser but without competing with it are potential affiliate partners as well. Vendors or existing customers can also become recruits if doing so makes sense and does not violate any laws or regulations.</p>
<p>

Almost any website could be recruited as an affiliate publisher, although high-traffic websites are more likely interested in (for their own sake) low-risk cost per mille or medium-risk cost per click deals rather than higher-risk cost per action or revenue share deals.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>

 Locating affiliate programs </st>
<p>

There are three primary ways to locate affiliate programs for a target website:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../694/5444694.xml">
affiliate programs directories</link>,</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 large affiliate networks that provide the platform for dozens or even hundreds of advertisers, and</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 the target website itself. (Websites that offer an affiliate program often have a link titled "affiliate program", "affiliates", "referral program", or "webmasters"—usually in the footer or "About" section of the website.)</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

If the above locations do not yield information pertaining to affiliates, it may be the case that there exists a non-public affiliate program. The most definitive method for finding this information is to contact the website owner directly.</p>

Past and current issues</st>
<p>

Since the emergence of affiliate marketing, there has been little control over affiliate activity.  Unscrupulous affiliates have used <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../368/28368.xml">
spam</link>, false advertising, forced clicks (to get tracking <text wordnetid="106387980" confidence="0.8">

 set on users' computers), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../616/2616.xml">
adware</link>, and other methods to drive traffic to their sponsors. Although many affiliate programs have <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/908799.xml">
terms of service</link> that contain rules against spam, this marketing method has historically proven to attract abuse from spammers.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
E-mail spam</st>
<p>

In the infancy of affiliate marketing, many Internet users held negative opinions due to the tendency of affiliates to use spam to promote the programs in which they were enrolled.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> As affiliate marketing matured, many affiliate merchants have refined their terms and conditions to prohibit affiliates from spamming.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Search engine spam</st>
<p>

As search engines have become more prominent, some affiliate marketers have shifted from sending e-mail spam to creating automatically-generated webpages that often contain product <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../371/13000371.xml">
data feeds</link> provided by merchants. The goal of such webpages is to manipulate the relevancy or prominence of resources indexed by a search engine, also known as <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../651/43651.xml">
spamdexing</link></it>. Each page can be targeted to a different niche market through the use of specific keywords, with the result being a skewed form of search engine optimization. </p>
<p>

Spam is the biggest threat to organic search engines, whose goal is to provide quality search results for keywords or phrases entered by their users. Google's <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

 algorithm update ("BigDaddy") in February 2006—the final stage of Google's major update ("Jagger") that began in mid-summer 2005—specifically targeted spamdexing with great success. This update thus enabled Google to remove a large amount of mostly computer-generated duplicate content from its index.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

Websites consisting mostly of affiliate links are regarded negatively as they do not offer quality content. In 2005 there were active changes made by Google, where certain websites were labeled as "thin affiliates".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref> Such websites were either removed from Google's index or were relocated within the results page (i.e., moved from the top-most results to a lower position). To avoid this categorization, affiliate marketer webmasters must create quality content on their websites that distinguishes their work from the work of spammers or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../044/34044.xml">
banner</link> farms, which only contain links leading to merchant sites.</p>
<p>

Affiliate links work best in the context of the information contained within the website itself. For instance, if a website contains information pertaining to publishing a website, an affiliate link leading to a merchant's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../245/100245.xml">
Internet service provider (ISP)</link> within that website's content would be appropriate. If a website contains information pertaining to sports, an affiliate link leading to a sporting goods website may work well within the context of the articles and information about sports. The goal is to publish quality information within the website and provide context-oriented links to related merchant's websites.</p>

Adware</st>
<p>

Although it differs from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../951/28951.xml">
spyware</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../616/2616.xml">
adware</link> often uses the same methods and technologies. Merchants initially were uninformed about adware, what impact it had, and how it could damage their brands. Affiliate marketers became aware of the issue much more quickly, especially because they noticed that adware often overwrites tracking cookies, thus resulting in a decline of commissions. Affiliates not employing adware felt that it was stealing commission from them. Adware often has no valuable purpose and rarely provides any useful content to the user, who is typically unaware that such software is installed on his/her computer. </p>
<p>

Affiliates discussed the issues in Internet forums and began to organize their efforts. They believed that the best way to address the problem was to discourage merchants from advertising via adware. Merchants that were either indifferent to or supportive of adware were exposed by affiliates, thus damaging those merchants' reputations and tarnishing their general affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates either terminated the use of such merchants or switched to a competitor's affiliate program. Eventually, affiliate networks were also forced by merchants and affiliates to take a stand and ban certain adware publishers from their network.

Trademark bidding</st>
<p>

Affiliates were among the earliest adopters of pay per click advertising when the first pay per click search engines such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/1025942.xml">
Goto.com</link> (which later became <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../942/1025942.xml">
Overture.com</link> after being acquired by <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/188213.xml">

 in 2003) emerged during the end of the 1990s. Later in 2000 <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/1092923.xml">
Google</link></company>
 launched its pay per click service, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../962/879962.xml">
Google AdWords</link>, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already well-occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, going so far as to allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Lack of self-regulation and collaboration</st>
<p>

Affiliate marketing is driven by entrepreneurs who are working at the forefront of Internet marketing. Affiliates are often the first to take advantage of emerging trends and technologies. The "trial and error" approach is probably the best way to describe the operation methods for affiliate marketers. This risky approach is one of the reasons why most affiliates fail or give up before they become successful "super affiliates", capable of generating US$10,000 or more per month in commission. This "frontier" life combined with the attitude found in such communities is likely the main reason why the affiliate marketing industry is unable to self-regulate beyond individual contracts between advertisers and affiliates. Affiliate marketing has experienced numerous failed attempts to create an industry organization or association of some kind that could be the initiator of regulations, standards, and guidelines for the industry.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> Some examples of failed regulation efforts are the Affiliate Union and iAfma.</p>
<p>

Online forums and industry trade shows are the only means for the different members from the industry—affiliates/publishers, merchants/advertisers, affiliate networks, third-party vendors, and service providers such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../307/5802307.xml">
outsourced program managers</link>—to congregate at one location. Online forums are free, enable small affiliates to have a larger say, and provide anonymity. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../368/1129368.xml">
Trade show</link>s are cost-prohibitive to small affiliates because of the high price for event passes. Larger affiliates may even be sponsored by an advertiser they promote.</p>
<p>

Because of the anonymity of online forums, the quantitative majority of industry members are unable to create any form of legally binding rule or regulation that must be followed throughout the industry. Online forums have had very few successes as representing the majority of the affiliate marketing industry. The most recent example of such a success was the halt of the 
"Commission Junction Link Management Initiative" (CJ LMI) in June/July 2006, when a single network tried to impose the use of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/9845.xml">
Javascript</link> tracking code as a replacement for common <format wordnetid="106636806" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 links on its affiliates.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Lack of industry standards</st>

<ss2>
<st>
Certification and training</st>
<p>

Affiliate marketing currently lacks industry standards for training and certification. There are some training courses and seminars that result in certifications; however, the acceptance of such certifications is mostly due to the reputation of the individual or company issuing the certification. Affiliate marketing is not commonly taught in universities, and only a few college instructors work with Internet marketers to introduce the subject to students majoring in marketing.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref></p>
<p>

Education occurs most often in "real life" by becoming involved and learning the details as time progresses. Although there are several books on the topic, some so-called "how-to" or "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../739/528739.xml">
silver bullet</link>" books instruct readers to manipulate holes in the Google <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../775/775.xml">
algorithm</link>, which can quickly become out of date, <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> or suggest strategies no longer endorsed or permitted by advertisers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref> </p>

Threat to traditional affiliate networks</st>
<p>

Cost per action networks can be viewed as a threat to "classic" affiliate marketing networks. Traditional affiliate marketing is resource-intensive and requires continual maintenance. Most of the maintenance includes managing, monitoring, and supporting affiliates. The goal of affiliate marketing is directed toward long-term and mutual beneficial partnerships between advertisers and affiliates. Cost per action networks, however, eliminate the need for the advertiser to build and maintain relationships to affiliates, as that task is performed for the advertiser by the cost per action network. The advertiser makes an offer, almost always CPA-based, and the cost per action networks handle the remainder of the process by mobilizing their affiliates to promote that offer. Cost per sale and revenue sharing are the primary compensation models for classic affiliate marketing, and are rarely found in cost per action networks. Affiliate marketers typically avoid the topic of cost per action networks; however, if it is being discussed, the debates can become heated and explosive.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref></p>

Marketing term</st>
<p>

Members of the marketing industry are recommending that "affiliate marketing" be substituted with an alternative name.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref> Affiliate marketing is often confused with either network marketing or multi-level marketing. <it>Performance marketing</it> is a common alternative, but other recommendations have been made as well.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref></p>
