In 1975, Privitera was convicted of selling <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../252/3252.xml">
laetrile</link>, an illegal and ineffective alternative treatment for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">

During his probationary period, Privitera, a proponent of the unproven <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/1845.xml">
alternative medical</link> technique of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/7124240.xml">

<p>

In 2001, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/58250.xml">
Health and Human Services</link> Office of the Inspector General issued a report on regulation of "unestablished laboratory tests" such as live blood analysis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>

Disciplinary action</st>

In 1999, a patient's death led to action by <administrative_unit wordnetid="108077292" confidence="0.8">
<agency wordnetid="108337324" confidence="0.8">

. According to the charges, a 71-year old patient with multiple medical problems had been seeing Privitera since 1991. She came to his office in March 1999 while she had been suffering from pain in the left arm for a few days. While in the waiting room she complained of a headache and asked for Tylenol. She was treated with 20,000 units of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../212/178212.xml">
anticoagulant</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/238115.xml">
heparin</link> under the tongue and subsequently with another 20,000 units subcutaneously while in Privitera’s office. The woman collapsed shortly after and his staff called 911. She was taken to the hospital <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../721/5721.xml">
coma</link>tose and bleeding from several orifices. The emergency room tests showed she was fully anticoagulated and unable to stop the bleeding in her head. She was declared <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../262/187262.xml">
brain dead</link> and died the next morning.</p>
<p>

The State charged Privitera with gross negligence, repeated negligent acts, incompetence, prescribing without indication, and inadequate records. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Prior to trial, in a plea bargain with the State, Privitera admitted to "failing to perform an adequate history and physical of a patient before commencing treatment and failing to maintain adequate and accurate records of the care and treatment provided to a patient in the manner set forth in the Accusation," all other charges were dropped <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> and he was reprimanded, fined and required to take courses on prescribing practices and recordkeeping by the California Board of Quality Medical Assurance for the above admission.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
