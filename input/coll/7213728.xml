After graduating from high school, Sahashi went to Paris to attend university and majored in physics although it took him five years to complete a two-year course and award status of his degree is unknown.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>

Sahashi spent several years jobless after returning from France<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> before founding <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../784/21784.xml">

The Concept is perhaps most comparable to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../913/13823913.xml">
direct method</link> of language instruction, although Sahashi's method pivots on the interaction with and the repeating of an instructor who was a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/263257.xml">
native speaker</link>. Sahashi thought a native speaker's voice would alleviate the difficulty of the average Japanese brain to distinguish English from background noise, as Japanese and English languages evoked different brain wave patterns.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> Sahashi had also patented a video phone camera device<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>, a telephone interpretation (translation) system and an at-home medical examination system which provides a virtual consultation room, a virtual waiting room, a virtual nursing room and a virtual individual conversation room depending upon the desired operation although the system does not provide for actual treatment. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

Financial crisis and downfall</st>
<p>

Sahashi was the company's long standing President and CEO until 2007. Following governmental restrictions and a financial crisis in 2007, Sahashi was removed as president by an emergency board meeting for failing to adequately explain his "opaque way of fundraising and negotiating with potential business alliance partners."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>.</p>
<p>

According to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../591/256591.xml">
Daily Yomiuri</link>, Sahashi made 159 million yen in 2006, even though his company lost 2.9 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/1136363.xml">
billion</link> yen. The <newspaper wordnetid="106267145" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../128/318128.xml">
Mainichi Shimbun</link></newspaper>
 reported that Sahashi and his family's stock in the company rapidly declined over a two week period in September 2007, from holdings of 70% to 20%.  It is believed this was done without filing a legally required report. A possible criminal complaint will be filed with legal authorities by receivers for Nova if it is proven Sahashi sold the stock without first filing the required report with authorities.In 1997, Sahashi paid 900 million yen in taxes, the fifth-highest paying taxpayer in the country.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

<p>

Sahashi came under scrutiny almost immediately after the collapse of Nova when court appointed administrators of the company allowed the media inside the president's luxury suite at Nova's administrative headquarters in Osaka to show "an example of (Sahashi) using the company to benefit himself."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>The office, a 330-square-meter executive suite on the 20th floor housed a red-carpeted reception room, private quarters including a dining room with a large-screen TV, a bathroom with sauna, a Japanese-style tea room and a room with a double bed.  Sahashi immediately submitted a petition to a local court rebutting allegations that he had used company assets to benefit his own wealth and lifestyle.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

In February 2008, Police announced they were investigating Sahashi for aggravated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../935/2565935.xml">
breach of trust</link> for using his position to reap profits for his affiliated company, Ginganet, which he also controlled. Ginganet sold the TV-phone sets system to Nova in addition to leasing the Ginganet-managed server for the video-phone lessons.  The investigation has revealed Ginganet had illicitly received around 500 million yen in profits from Nova for the use of the server. The bankruptcy administrator had also earlier noted that the price of the TV-telephone devices Ginganet charged Nova was unreasonably high, which could have resulted in Nova losing several billion yen. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
<p>

In June 2008 police also announced they were investigating Sahashi for possible <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../411/209411.xml">
embezzlement</link> in the course of business for his ordering the transfer of the entire balance of a separately managed employee fund to a Nova business account to allow the payment of refunds to students. Sahashi, who owned the affiliate firm that handled the money transfer, did so in July 2007 to cover operating costs and done without the approval of employees. Nova employees had made monthly contributions from their pay to fund a <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

<p>

On the same day that Investigators raided Nova Kikaku's former headquarters, Sahashi along with former president and accounting manager of Nova Kikaku Toshihiko Murata<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>, were arrested on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../812/15812.xml">

July 30</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/35825.xml">
2008</link> he announced his intention to plead not-guilty.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Murata, reputed to be Sahashi's right-hand man, reportedly admitted to allegations of embezzlement in the conduct of business.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

Name change</st>
<p>

News articles occasionally differ in the spelling/pronunciation of his last name. The confusion apparently began in 2002 when Nozomu Saruhashi became upset after seeing his name printed in an article phonetically rendered in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../851/16851.xml">
katakana</link> as サル ("saru", サル), which Saruhashi saw as deliberately emphasizing the first character in his name (猿), which means "monkey." He then shocked the staff the next day by insisting his surname was henceforth <it>Sahashi</it>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
