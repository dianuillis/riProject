In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../336/4771336.xml">
mathematical sociology</link>, <b>interpersonal ties</b> are defined as information-carrying connections between people. Interpersonal ties, generally, come in three varieties: <it>strong</it>, <it>weak</it>, or <it>absent</it>.  Weak social ties, it is argued, are responsible for the majority of the embeddedness and structure of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social networks</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/37235.xml">
society</link> as well as the transmission of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/18985062.xml">
information</link> through these networks.  Specifically, more novel information flows to individuals through weak rather than strong ties. Because our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, the information they receive overlaps considerably with what we already know. Acquaintances, by contrast, know people that we do not, and thus receive more novel information.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> </p>
<p>

Included in the definition of <it>absent ties</it>, according to Granovetter, are those relationships (or ties) without substantial significance, such as "nodding" relationships between people living on the same street, or the "tie", for example, to a frequent vendor one would buy from. Furthermore, the fact that two people may know each other by name does not necessarily qualify the existence of a weak tie. If their interaction is negligible the tie may be <it>absent</it>. The "strength" of an interpersonal tie is a linear combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (or mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize each tie.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

To obtain data for his doctoral thesis, Granovetter interviewed dozens of people to find out how social networks are used to land new jobs. Granovetter found that most jobs were found through "weak" acquaintances.  This pattern reminded Granovetter of his freshman chemistry lesson that demonstrated how "weak" <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/13609.xml">
hydrogen bond</link>s hold huge water molecules together, which are themselves held together by "strong" <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../246/6246.xml">
covalent bonds</link>.</p>
<p>

In 1970 Dr. Granovetter submitted his doctoral dissertation to <university wordnetid="108286163" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../501/18426501.xml">

, entitled "Changing Jobs: Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Community." The thesis of his dissertation illustrated the conception of weak ties. For his research, Dr. Granovetter crossed the Charles River to Newton, Massachusetts where he surveyed 282 professional, technical, and managerial workers in total. 100 were personally interviewed, in regards to the type of ties between the job changer and the contact person who provided the necessary information.  Tie strength was measured in terms of how often they saw the contact person during the period of the job transition, using the following assignment:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>often</b> = at least once a week</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>occasionally</b> = more than once a year but less than twice a week</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>rarely</b> = once a year or less</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Of those who found jobs through personal contacts (N=54), 16.7% reported seeing their contact often, 55.6% reported seeing their contact occasionally, and 27.8% rarely.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref>  When asked whether a friend had told them about their current job, the most frequent answer was “not a friend, an acquaintance.”  The conclusion from this study is that weak ties are an important resource in occupational mobility.  When seen from a macro point of view, weak ties play a role in effecting social cohesion.</p>

Social networks</st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network theory</link>, social relationships are viewed in terms of <it>nodes</it> and <it>ties</it>.  Nodes are the individual actors within the networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors. There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes. In its most simple form, a social network is a map of all of the relevant ties between the nodes being studied.</p>

Weak tie hypothesis</st>
<p>

The "weak tie hypothesis" argues, using a combination of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../934/22934.xml">

 in 1957, that if A is linked to both B and C, then there is a greater than chance probability that B and C are linked to each other:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>  </p>
<p>

<image width="300px" src="Weak-strong-ties.svg">

 </p>
<p>

That is, if we consider any two randomly selected individuals, such as A and B, from the set S = A, B, C, D, E, ..., of all persons with ties to either or both of them, then, for example, if A is strongly tied to both B and C, then according to probability arguments, the B-C tie is always present.  The absence of the B-C tie, in this situation, would create, according to Granovetter, what is called the <it>forbidden triad</it>.  In other words, the B-C tie, according to this logic, is always present, whether weak or strong, given the other two strong ties.  In this direction, the "weak tie hypothesis" postulates that clumps or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../764/1267764.xml">
clique</link>s of social structure will form, being bound predominately by "strong ties", and that "weak ties" will function as the crucial bridge between any two densely knit clumps of close friends.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref>  </p>
<p>

It follows, then, that individuals with few weak ties will be deprived of information from distant parts of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/634444.xml">
social system</link> and will be confined to the provincial news and views of their close friends. From this basis, other theories can be formulated and tested, e.g. that the diffusion of information, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../054/254054.xml">
rumor</link>s, may tend to be dampened by strong ties, and thus flow more easily through weak ties.</p>

 and others developed a probabilistic approach to the characterization of large social networks in which the nodes are persons and the links are acquaintanceship.  During these years, formulas were derived that connected local parameters such as closure of contacts, and the supposed existence of the B-C tie to the global network property of connectivity.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>   </p>
<p>

Moreover, acquaintanceship (in most cases) is a <b>positive tie</b>. However, there are also <b>negative ties</b> such as animosity among persons.  To tackle this problem, <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/12401.xml">
graph theory</link></it> (or the mathematical study of abstract representations of networks), can be extended to include these two types of links. This creates models that represent both positive and negative sentiment relations.  </p>

 in 1956. It says that if a network of interrelated positive and negative ties is balanced, then it consists of two subnetworks such that each has positive ties among its nodes and negative ties between nodes in distinct subnetworks. In other words, "my friend's enemy is my enemy". <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref>  The imagery here is of a social system that splits into two cliques. There is, however, a special case where one of the two subnetworks may be empty, which might occur in very small networks. </p>
<p>

In these two developments, we have mathematical models bearing upon the analysis of the structure.  Other early influential developments in mathematical sociology pertained to process.  For instance, in 1952 <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 produced a mathematical formalization of a published theory of social groups by constructing a model consisting of a deterministic system of differential equations.  A formal study of the system led to theorems about the dynamics and the implied <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/265823.xml">

The individualistic perspective</st>
<p>

Granovetter’s work (1973) proved to be crucial in the individualistic approach of the social network theory as seen by the amount of references in other papers. 
His argument asserts that weak ties (acquaintances, according to Granovetter, 1973; 1983) are less likely to be involved within the social network than strong ties (close friends and family). By not going further in the strong ties, but focusing on the weak ties, Granovetter highlights the importance of acquaintances in social networks. He argues, that the only thing what can connect two social networks with strong ties is a weak tie: “… these clumps / [strong ties networks] would not, in fact, be connected to one another at all were it not for the existence of weak ties. (Granovetter, 1973 pp 1363; 1983 pp 202). </p>
<p>

It follows that in an all-covering social network individuals are disadvantageous with a few weak links compared to individuals with multiple weak links as they are disconnected with the other parts of the network. Another interesting observation that Granovetter makes in his work is the fact of forth going specialization of individuals creates the necessity for weak ties as all the other specialist information and knowledge is present in other social networks (Granovetter, 1973). </p>
<p>

Cross et al., (2001) confirm this by presenting six features which differentiate effective and ineffective knowledge sharing relations: 
“1)knowing what other person knows and thus when to turn to them; 
2) being able to gain timely access to that person; 
3) willingness of the person sought out to engage in the problem solving rather than dump information; 
4) a degree of safety in the relationship that promoted learning and creativity; 
5) the factors put by <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

This fits in nicely with Granovetter’s argument that “Weak ties provide people with access to information and resources beyond those available in their own social circle; but strong ties have greater motivation to be of assistance and are typically more easily available.” (Granovetter, 1983, pp 209) </p>

This weak/strong ties paradox is elaborated by myriad authors. The extent in which individuals are connected to others is called centrality. Sparrowe &amp; Linden (1997) argue how the position of a person in a social network confer advantages such organizational assimilation, and job performance (Sparrowe et al., 2001); Burt (1992) expects it to result in promotions, Brass (1984) affiliates centrality with power and Friedkin (1993) with influence in decision power. Other authors, such as Krackhardt and Porter (1986) contemplate the disadvantages of the position is social networks such as organizational exit (see also Sparrowe et al., 2001) and Wellman et al.,(1988) introduce the use of social networks for emotional and material support.</p>
