The exclusion principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario; One usually considers that the desire to lift oneâ€™s arm as a mental event, and the lifting on one's arm, a physical event. According to the exclusion principle, there must be an event that does not supervene on <it>e</it> while causing <it>e*</it>. To show this better, substitute "<it>the desire to lift one's arm</it>" for "<it>e</it>", and "<it>one to lift their arm</it>" for "<it>e*</it>".</p>

If <it>the desire to lift one's arm</it> causes <it>one to lift their arm</it>, then there is no event such that it is non-supervenient on <it>the desire to lift one's arm</it> and it causes <it>one to lift their arm</it>.
</indent>

This is interpreted as meaning, mental events supervene upon the physical. However, some philosophers do not accept this principle, and accept <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../496/9496.xml">
epiphenomenalism</link>, which states mental events are caused by physical events, but physical events are not caused by mental events (called <it>causal impotence</it>). However, If <it>e#</it> does not cause <it>e</it>, then there is no way to verify that <it>e*</it> exists. Yet, this debate has not been settled in the philosophical community.</p>
