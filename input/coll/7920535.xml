An <b>earthen floor</b>, also called an adobe floor, is a floor made of dirt, raw earth, or other unworked ground materials.  It is usually constructed, in modern times, with a mixture of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/18994037.xml">
sand</link>, finely chopped <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../594/46594.xml">
straw</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../980/36980.xml">
clay</link>, mixed to a thickened consistency and spread with a trowel on a sub-surface such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../371/5371.xml">
concrete</link>. Once dry, it is then usually saturated with several treatments of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../713/752713.xml">
drying oil</link>.

History</st>
<p>

Earthen floors were predominant in most houses until the mid 1300s in Europe, and persist to this day in many parts of the world.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  In medieval times, almost all peasant housing had earthen floors, usually of hardpacked dirt topped off with a thin layer of straw for warmth and comfort. 
Soil in the southwestern parts of the US contain nearly a perfectly mixed ratio of adobe.
In China, most cottages and smaller houses also had earthen floors, made of rammed earth and sealed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link> or raw linseed.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Construction</st>

<p>

In modern times, most earthen floors are often laid over the top of a subfloor of tamped gravel and then a mixture of clay, sand and fiber are mixed and leveled onto the tamped subfloor. These layers can be 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch thick. The thinner layers will dry faster but require a better subfloor for strength or more layers. Earthen floors can be laid over the top of previously installed wood floors but, as always, weight can become an issue.</p>

Finishing</st>
<p>

A drying oil like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../711/295711.xml">
Linseed oil</link> is usually used to seal the floor and protect it from wear and tear. A final coat of Hard Oil, and Wax Impregnation are also used.</p>
