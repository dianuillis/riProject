<b>Glucosamine</b> (C6H13NO5) is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/522407.xml">
amino sugar</link> and a prominent precursor in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../954/3954.xml">
biochemical</link> synthesis of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/474363.xml">
glycosylated</link> proteins and lipids. A type of glucosamine forms <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../104/171104.xml">
chitin</link>, which composes the exoskeletons of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../357/44357.xml">

Biochemistry</st>

<p>

Glucosamine was first identified in 1876 by Dr. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/14921398.xml">
Georg Ledderhose</link>, but the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../756/28756.xml">
stereochemistry</link> was not fully defined until 1939 by the work of <scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/553525.xml">
Walter Haworth</link></scientist>
.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  D-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../407/522407.xml">
nitrogen-containing sugars</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> Specifically, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../191/5712191.xml">

glutamine</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  The end-product of this pathway is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../909/13939909.xml">
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine</link> (UDP-GlcNAc), which is then used for making <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/1072173.xml">
glycosaminoglycan</link>s, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../545/881545.xml">
proteoglycans</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../208/1065208.xml">
glycolipids</link>.  </p>
<p>

As the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate is the first step for the synthesis of these products, glucosamine may be important in regulating their production. However, the way that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is actually regulated, and whether this could be involved in contributing to human disease, remains unclear.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

Health effects</st>
<p>

Oral glucosamine is commonly used for the treatment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../841/504841.xml">
osteoarthritis</link>. Since glucosamine is a precursor for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/1072173.xml">
glycosaminoglycans</link>, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../945/166945.xml">
joint cartilage</link>, supplemental glucosamine may help to rebuild cartilage and treat arthritis. Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis appears safe, but there is conflicting evidence as to its effectiveness.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found glucosamine sulfate is no better than placebo in reducing the symptoms or progression of hip osteoarthritis. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> </p>

<st>
Use</st>
<p>

A typical dosage of glucosamine <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../200/1605200.xml">
salt</link> is 1,500 mg per day. Glucosamine contains an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../412/1412.xml">
amino group</link> that is positively <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../804/9804.xml">
charged</link> at physiological <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/24530.xml">
pH</link>. The <link>
anion</link> included in the salt may vary. Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulphate and glucosamine hydrochloride. The amount of glucosamine present in 1500 mg of glucosamine salt will depend on which anion is present and whether additional salts are included in the manufacturer's calculation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/504825.xml">
chondroitin sulfate</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/945206.xml">
methylsulfonylmethane</link>.</p>
<p>

Glucosamine is a popular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../845/1845.xml">
alternative medicine</link> used by consumers for the treatment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../841/504841.xml">
osteoarthritis</link>. Glucosamine is also extensively used in veterinary medicine as an unregulated but widely accepted supplement..</p>

Safety</st>
<p>

Clinical studies have consistently reported that glucosamine appears safe. Since glucosamine is usually derived from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/55037.xml">
shellfish</link>, those allergic to shellfish may wish to avoid it. However, since glucosamine is derived from the shells of these animals while the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/58859.xml">
allergen</link> is within the flesh of the animals, it is probably safe even for those with shellfish allergy.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> Alternative sources using fungal fermentation of corn are available. Another concern has been that the extra glucosamine could contribute to diabetes by interfering with the normal regulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> but several investigations have found no evidence that this occurs.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> A review conducted by Anderson et al in 2005 summarizes the effects of glucosamine on glucose metabolism in <it>in vitro</it> studies, the effects of oral administration of large doses of glucosamine in animals and the effects of glucosamine supplementation with normal recommended dosages in humans, concluding that glucosamine does not cause glucose intolerance and has no documented effects on glucose metabolism.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Other studies conducted in lean or obese subjects concluded that oral glucosamine at standard doses does not cause or significantly worsen insulin resistance or endothelial dysfunction.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>

insulin resistance</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> </p>
<p>

In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../632/11632.xml">
Food and Drug Administration</link> for medical use in humans.  Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement in the US, safety and formulation are solely the responsibility of the manufacturer; evidence of safety and efficacy is not required as long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref> </p>
<p>

In Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate. In this case, evidence of safety and efficacy is required for the medical use of glucosamine and several guidelines have recommended its use as an effective and safe therapy for osteoarthritis. Actually, the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee recently granted glucosamine sulfate a level of toxicity of 5 in a 0-100 scale,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> and recent OARSI (OsteoArthritis Research Society International) guidelines for hip and knee osteoarthritis also confirm its excellent safety profile.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>

Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics</st>
<p>

Two recent studies confirm that glucosamine is bioavailable both systemically and at the site of action (the joint) after oral administration of crystalline glucosamine sulfate in osteoarthritis patients. Steady state glucosamine concentrations in plasma and synovial fluid were correlated and in line with those effective in selected in vitro studies.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref></p>

Mechanisms of action</st>
<p>

The benefit of glucosamine sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of effects including its anti-inflammatory activity,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref> the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes and other substances that contribute to damage cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref></p>

Clinical studies</st>
<p>

There have been multiple <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../717/241717.xml">
clinical trial</link>s of glucosamine as a medical therapy for osteoarthritis, but results have been conflicting. The evidence both for and against glucosamine's efficacy has led to debate among physicians about whether to recommend glucosamine treatment to their patients.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref></p>
<p>

Multiple clinical trials in the 1980s and 1990s, all sponsored by the European patent-holder, Rottapharm, demonstrated a benefit for glucosamine. However, these studies were of poor quality due to shortcomings in their methods, including small size, short duration, poor <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../402/5080402.xml">
analysis of drop-outs</link>, and unclear procedures for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../248/277248.xml">
blinding</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> Rottapharm then sponsored two large (at least 100 patients per group), three-year-long, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../821/142821.xml">
placebo-controlled</link> clinical trials of the Rottapharm brand of glucosamine sulfate. These studies both demonstrated a clear benefit for glucosamine treatment.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref>  There was not only an improvement in symptoms but also an improvement in joint space narrowing on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../807/95807.xml">
radiographs</link>. This suggested that glucosamine, unlike pain relievers such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../071/22071.xml">
NSAID</link>s, can actually help prevent the destruction of cartilage that is the hallmark of osteoarthritis. On the other hand, several subsequent studies, independent of Rottapharm, but smaller and shorter, did not detect any benefit of glucosamine.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref></p>
<p>

Due to these controversial results, some reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the efficacy of glucosamine. Richy et al. performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in 2003 and found efficacy for glucosamine on VAS and <link>
WOMAC</link> pain, Lequesne index and VAS mobility and good tolerability.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref></p>
<p>

Recently, a review by Bruyere et al. about glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis concludes that both products act as valuable symptomatic therapies for osteoarthritis disease with some potential structure-modifying effects.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2239%22])">39</ref></p>
<p>

This situation led the <institute wordnetid="108407330" confidence="0.8">

 to fund a large, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../461/2221461.xml">
multicenter clinical trial</link> (the GAIT trial) studying reported pain in osteoarthritis of the knee, comparing groups treated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/504825.xml">
chondroitin sulfate</link>, glucosamine, and the combination, as well as both placebo and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../828/648828.xml">
celecoxib</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2240%22])">40</ref> The results of this 6-month trial found that patients taking glucosamine HCl, chondroitin sulfate, or a combination of the two had no <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../995/160995.xml">
statistically significant</link> improvement in their symptoms compared to patients taking a placebo.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2241%22])">41</ref> The group of patients who took celecoxib did have a statistically significant improvement in their symptoms. These results suggest that glucosamine and chondroitin did not effectively relieve pain in the overall group of osteoarthritis patients, but it should be interpreted with caution because most patients presented only mild pain (thus a narrow margin to appraise pain improvement) and because of an unusual response to placebo in the trial (60%). However, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../589/416589.xml">
exploratory analysis</link> of a subgroup of patients suggested that the supplements taken together (glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate) may be significantly more effective than placebo (79.2% versus 54%; p = 0.002) and a 10% higher than the positive control, in patients with pain classified as moderate to severe (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/416831.xml">
testing hypotheses suggested by the data</link>).  </p>
<p>

In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marc Hochberg also noted that "It is disappointing that the GAIT investigators did not use glucosamine sulfate ... since the results would then have provided important information that might have explained in part the heterogeneity in the studies reviewed by Towheed and colleagues"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2242%22])">42</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2243%22])">43</ref> But this concern is not shared by pharmacologists at the <work wordnetid="104599396" confidence="0.8">

 who state, "The counter anion of the glucosamine salt (i.e. chloride or sulfate) is unlikely to play any role in the action or pharmacokinetics of glucosamine".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2244%22])">44</ref> Thus the question of glucosamine's efficacy will not be resolved without further updates or trials.</p>
<p>

In this respect, a 6-month double-blind, multicenter trial has been recently performed to assess the efficacy of glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg once daily compared to placebo and acetaminophen in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (GUIDE study). The results showed that glucosamine sulfate improved the Lequesne algofunctional index significantly compared to placebo and the positive control. Secondary analyses, including the OARSI responder indices, were also significantly favorable for glucosamine sulfate.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2245%22])">45</ref></p>
<p>

A subsequent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../329/62329.xml">
meta-analysis</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../180/163180.xml">
randomized controlled trials</link>, including the NIH trial by Clegg, concluded that hydrochloride is not effective and that there was too much heterogeneity among trials of glucosamine sulfate to draw a conclusion.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2246%22])">46</ref> In response to these conclusions, Dr. J-Y Reginster in an accompanying editorial suggests that the authors failed to apply the principles of a sound systematic review to the meta-analysis, but instead put together different efficacy outcomes and trial designs by mixing 4-week studies with 3-year trials, intramuscular/intraarticular administrations with oral ones, and low-quality small studies reported in the early 1980s with high-quality studies reported in 2007.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2247%22])">47</ref></p>
<p>

However, currently OARSI (OsteoArthritis Research Society International) is recommending glucosamine as the second most effective treatment for moderate cases of osteoarthritis. Likewise, recent European League Against Rheumatism practice guidelines for knee osteoarthritis grants to glucosamine sulfate the highest level of evidence, 1A, and strength of the recommendation, A.</p>
