<b>NRG Networks</b> is a UK-based <link>
entrepreneurial networking</link> organisation, founded in June 2004 by Kim Sharman and Martin Davies to facilitate the development of business relationships based on trust and knowledge between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../500/155500.xml">
SME</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../206/39206.xml">
Business</link> Owners in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network</link> environment. Dave Clarke  joined as Chief Executive at the end of 2004 and identified that these business relationships resulted in a network of advocates. Networking for Advocates was subsequently introduced as the NRG networking model. Kim Sharman retired at the end of 2006.<p>

The model of "Networking for Advocates" was investigated in some research conducted by Martin Davies and Roger Croft of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../992/153992.xml">
University of Bath</link>. The purpose of the research was to further understand the importance of developing trust in business relationships. The research identified certain networking transactions as the currency of developing trusted business relationships. This led to the development of the NRG Networking System based on this Advocacy Model.</p>
