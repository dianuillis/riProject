The <b>Geriatric Depression Scale</b> (GDS) is a 30-item <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../065/6224065.xml">
self-report</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/465183.xml">
assessment</link> used to identify <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/8389.xml">
depression</link> in the elderly.

Description</st>
<p>

The GDS questions are answered "yes" or "no", instead of a five-category response set. This simplicity enables the scale to be used with ill or moderately cognitively impaired individuals. The scale is commonly used as a routine part of a comprehensive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../825/436825.xml">
geriatric</link> assessment. One point is assigned to each answer and the cumulative score is rated on a scoring grid. The grid sets a range of 0-9 as "normal", 10-19 as "mildly depressed", and 20-30 as "severely depressed".</p>
<p>

A <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../525/18507525.xml">
diagnosis</link> of clinical depression should not be based on GDS results alone. Although the test has well-established <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/239138.xml">
reliability</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../140/239140.xml">
validity</link> evaluated against other diagnostic criteria, responses should be considered along with results from a comprehensive diagnostic work-up. A short version of the GDS containing 15 questions has been developed, and the scale is available in languages other than <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../916/8569916.xml">
English</link></language>
. The GDS was first developed in 1982 by J.A. Yesavage and others.</p>
