<b>Single user mode</b> is a mode in which a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../751/39751.xml">
multiuser</link> computer <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../909/40909.xml">
boots</link> into a single <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../209/264209.xml">
superuser</link>. It is mainly used for maintenance of multi-user environments such as network servers. Some tasks may require exclusive access to shared resources, for example running <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../881/79881.xml">
fsck</link> on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../814/7667814.xml">
network share</link>. This mode may also be used for security purposes - network services are not run, eliminating the possibility of outside interference. On some  systems a lost <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../209/264209.xml">
superuser</link> password can be changed by switching to single user mode, but not asking for the password in such circumstances is viewed as a security vulnerability.

Mac OS X</link> users can accomplish this by holding down Apple key/Command (for users of Mac OS 10.4 or up)+S after powering the system. The user may be required to enter a password set in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../155/41155.xml">
firmware</link>. Single User Mode is different from a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../414/1850414.xml">
Safe Mode</link> boot in that the system goes directly to the console instead of starting up the core elements of Mac OS X (items in /System/Library/, ignoring /Library/, ~/Library/, et al.). From there users are encouraged by a prompt to run <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../881/79881.xml">
fsck</link> or other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/6707.xml">
command line</link> utilities as needed (or installed).</p>

runlevel</link>s. Runlevels are usually changed using the init command, runlevel 1 or S will boot into single user mode.</p>
