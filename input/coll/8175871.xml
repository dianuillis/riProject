 decided not to seek re-election in 1987. Hopkins defeated the Fourth Congressional District Republican chairman, Kenneth "Ken" Frazier, and a fellow Democrat, Norbert Johnson. Hopkins polled 6,756 votes (53 percent) to Frazier's 5,128 (40 percent), and Johnson's 813 ballots (6 percent).

<p>

Another Republican, David Hunter, tried to defeat Hopkins in 1991 but failed miserably. Hopkins polled 8,187 (73 percent) to Hunter's 2,964 (27 percent). Republicans left Hopkins unopposed in the 1995, 1999, and 2003 primaries. However, two Democrats, attorney Kirby Kelly and Philip Green, challenged him in 2003. Hopkins received 6,861 votes that year to Kelly's 2,322 (24 percent) and Green's 606 ballots (6 percent)</p>

His legislative tenure</st>

<p>

In the House, Hopkins supported the LSU Health Sciences Center in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../473/150473.xml">
Shreveport</link> and the establishment of the Louisiana State <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../510/4207510.xml">
Oil</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../131/22131.xml">
[Natural] Gas</link> Museum in Oil City. He also wrote legislation that divided <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../031/835031.xml">
riverboat</link> taxes among local governments.</p>
<p>

The Shreveport Times, his regional newspaper, described Hopkins as having a great sense of humor and a "biting wit" but "adept at getting bills passed and maneuvering behind the scenes to kill legislation he opposed." Hopkins was a veteran member of the important House Appropriations Committee. He was elected by the legislative delegation of the Fourth Congressional District to serve as its representative on the state House panel.</p>

Hopkins authored a bill to provide health benefits to lawmakers who had served prior to the installation of term limits. The bill passed, but Democratic Governor <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../186/369186.xml">
Kathleen Babineaux Blanco</link> vetoed the bill at the "urging of Republican lawmakers, many of whom had voted for the legislation. . . .  People never understood that Hoppy wasn't doing that for himself. He was just thinking about other members. He already had [his own] insurance . . . and retirement," Montgomery explained.</p>

Salter noted that the commissioner of administration once threatened Hopkins about projects in north Caddo Parish. "Hoppy told him to go ahead and pull the damn things, but he wasn't voting" as the commissioner requested, Salter said.</p>
<p>

Billy Montgomery told The Times that ethics laws were unneeded for legislators like Hopkins: "He just had common sense, and he was a good person. If you want to pattern yourself, as an alderman, a small town mayor or a member of a legislature, he's the pattern to follow."</p>

Todd Hopkins eulogized his father as "my mentor, . . .  my hero, and my friend. We will miss him, but we know that he is in a better place. He fought a good fight." When the church sanctuary filled, mourners were directed to an overflow area in the gymnasium.</p>
<p>

Speaker Salter told the mourners that "Hoppy was always faithful in terms of his service. Even when he was ill, he would come to the sessions. He demonstrated his desire to serve in spite of his illness." Salter added that Hopkins was "tremendously brave when he faced death. He talked about it and made plans. And he never questioned why. It was quite a testimony the way he faced death."</p>
