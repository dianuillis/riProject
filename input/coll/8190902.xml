<b>Anomaly Detection</b> may refer to an unsupervised <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../253/42253.xml">
data mining</link> technique that produces a <link>
data mining model</link> for identifying cases (records) that deviate from the norm in a dataset. The data provided for model building consists of normal cases from which an anomaly detection algorithm, such as One Class <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../309/65309.xml">
Support Vector Machine</link>, learns normal patterns. Applying the model to data with similar schema and attribute content yields a probability that each case is normal or anomalous.<p>

It may be used, for example, in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/58790.xml">
fraud detection</link>.</p>

Anomaly detection was proposed for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../021/113021.xml">
Intrusion detection systems</link> (IDS) by Dorothy Denning in 1986.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  Anomaly detection for IDS is normally accomplished with thresholds and statistics, but can also be done with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../158/201158.xml">
Soft computing</link>, and inductive learning<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>.  Types of statistics proposed by 1999 included profiles of users, workstations, networks, remote hosts, groups of users, and programs based on frequencies, means, variances, covariances, and standard deviations.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>  The counterpart of Anomaly detection in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../184/2010184.xml">
Intrusion detection</link> is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../403/9245403.xml">
