Educational career</st>
<p>

Venkatraman Shastri started his educational career as a student of the National College in <link>
Trichanapalli</link>. After that he moved to the Church Missionary Society College and eventually the Hindu College, both in <legal_power wordnetid="105198427" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../222/1126222.xml">
Tirunelveli</link></legal_power>
. He was consistently first place in all subjects in all of his classes. Shastri passed his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../917/369917.xml">
matriculation</link> examination from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../321/636321.xml">
Madras University</link> in January, 1899, where he also finished at the head of the class. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

As a student Venkatraman was marked for his splendid brilliance, superb retentive memory and an insatiable curiosity. By deluging his teachers with piercing questions, making them uneasy, and frequently forcing them to admit ignorance he was considered a terribly mischievous student. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> </p>
<p>

Although Venkatraman always scored high in subjects like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/18831.xml">
mathematics</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/26700.xml">
sciences</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../132/53132.xml">
humanities</link>, he was also proficient in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../524/17524.xml">
languages</link> and particularly adept in <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/27698.xml">
Sanskrit</link></language>
. According to his own testimonials, Sanskrit and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../622/9208622.xml">
oratory</link> were his favourite subjects. Such was his mastery over the language, that he was awarded the title "<it>Saraswati</it>" by the Madras Sanskrit Association in July, 1899 at the age of 16. At about that time, Venkatraman was profoundly influenced by his Sanskrit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../936/167936.xml">
guru</link> Sri Vedam Venkatrai Shastri whom he remembered with deepest love, reverence and gratitude, with tears in his eyes. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

 Sri Satchidānanda Sivābhinava Nrisimha Bhārati Swami. However, his spiritual practise was interrupted when he was pressurized by nationalist leaders to head the newly started National College at <link>
Rajmahendri</link>. Prof. Venkatraman Saraswati taught at the college for three years. But in 1911, he suddenly left the college to go back to Sri Satchidānanda Sivābhinava Nrisimha Bhārati Swami at the Sringeri Math in his quest for spiritual knowledge. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

philosophy</link> at the feet of Shri Nrisimha Bhārati Swami.   This cannot be true.  The then Sringeri Jagadguru until April 1912 was Sri Sachidananda Shivabhinava Nrusimha Bharathi Swamigal.  The Swamigal attained Mahasamadhi during April 1912 and was immediately succeeded to the Peeta, by his Disciple Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi Swamigal.    Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi was in the Peeta until 1954.    </p>
<p>

Venkaraman Saraswathi could not have hence learnt for 8 years with Sri Nrusimha Bharathi Mahaswamigal from 1911 at Sringeri.  Also, When Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Swamigal was in the Peeta, there was no one else nominated as the Successor, until much later when Jagadguru Srimad Abhinava Vidya Theerta Swamigal was nominated as the Successor.</p>

He also practised vigorous meditation, <it>Brahma-sadhana</it> and <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/34258.xml">

Around the time the Swami became Shankaracharya of Sharada Peetha, the Shankaracharya of <link>
Govardhan Math Puri</link>, Jagadguru Śankarācārya Sri Madhusudhan Tirtha, was in failing health and was greatly impressed by Bharati Krishna Tirtha. Madhusudan Tirtha requested Bharati to succeed him at the Govardhan Math, however the Swami respectfully declined the offer. However, in 1925, Śankarācārya Sri Madhusudhan Tirtha's health took a serious turn and Swami Bhārāti Kŗşņa Tirtha had to accept the Govardhan Math's <it>Gadi</it>. In 1925, Swami Bhārāti Kŗşņa Tirtha assumed the pontificate of Shankaracharya of Govardhan Math, <region wordnetid="108630985" confidence="0.8">

After becoming the Shankaracharya of Govardhan Math, Swami Bharati toured all over the world for 35 years to spread the values of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../702/24702.xml">
peace</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../258/40258.xml">
harmony</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../017/625017.xml">
brotherhood</link> and to spread the message of the <link>
Sanātana Dharma</link>. He took upon himself the colossal task of the renaissance of Indian culture.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref></p>
<p>

While being a pontiff, he wrote a large number of treatises and books on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../414/25414.xml">
religion</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/26700.xml">

world peace</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../862/289862.xml">
social</link> issues. In 1953, at Nagpur, he founded an organization called "<it>Sri Vishwa Punarnirmana Sangha</it>" (World Reconstruction Association). Initially, the administrative board consisted of Jagadguruji's disciples, devotees and admirers of his spiritual ideals for humanitarian service, but later many distinguished people started to contribute to the mission. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../035/356035.xml">

 and ex-Chairman of the University Grants Commission served as its Vice-President. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

In February 1958 he went on a trans-oceanic tour to America to speak on world peace and Vedanta, staying three months in Los Angeles, California traveling via the United Kingdom. This was the first tour outside India by a Shankaracharya in the history of the order.  The tour was sponsored by Self Realization Fellowship of Los Angeles, the Vedantic Society founded by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../475/143475.xml">
Paramhansa Yogananda</link> in America. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>
<p>

He attended many national and international religious conferences and many other <it>yoga</it> workshops. He believed in the Vedantic ideal of "<it>Pūrnatva</it>" which literally translated means, "all-round <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../374/1928374.xml">
perfection</link> and harmony". He remained the Shankaracharya of the Govardhan Matha until his death in 1960. </p>
<p>

In 1965 a Chair of Vedic Studies was founded at Banares Hindu University by Shri Arvind N. Mafatlala, a generous Mumbai business magnate and math devotee of the late Swami Sankaracarya.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>

Jagadguru Swami Sri Bhārāti Kŗşņa Tirthaji Maharaja's book "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../536/567536.xml">
Vedic Mathematics</link>" opened the floodgates of similar literature, often derived from the Swami's 16 Sūtras themselves. His treatise on this field of mathematics is a fundamental work on speed and accuracy in basic mathematics. The Vedic Math ideal is a mental calculation and one-line notation.</p>
<p>

The foundations of Vedic Mathematics were mentioned in the <text wordnetid="106387980" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../181/1527181.xml">
Vedas</link></text>
 themselves and even in the <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../389/223389.xml">

</idea>
 scriptures. These had lain unused for many millennia, till the Swami rediscovered them. </p>
<p>

His book, <it>Vedic Mathematics</it>, comprises many algorithms. He revealed his source in the ancient Hindu Vedas. Some are intuitively reconstructed from the <it>Atharva</it> Veda and from Parisistas (appendix) of the <it>Atharva</it> Veda. "The Upaveda of Sthapatya (engineering) comprises all kinds of architectural and structural human endeavor and all visual arts (and mathematics)." His work seems to be a whole Parisistas (appendix) itself. </p>
<p>

The ancient <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/27698.xml">
Sanskrit</link></language>
 writers did not use numerals when writing big numbers but preferred to use the letters of the Sanskrit <link>
Devanāgarī</link> alphabet. In the Vedic Sūtras the key word steps to solving many problems are given in a terse, decimal code of certain sets of rhyming syllables, within the verses of the Sūtra.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref>  The fact that the alphabetic code is in the natural order and can be immediately interpreted, is clear proof that the code language was resorted not for concealment but for greater ease in verification.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
<p>

The Swami had written sixteen volumes on the Vedic Mathematics field explaining all the topics of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../831/18831.xml">
mathematical study</link>. Alas, many advanced formula were promised but not given in his first and only book.  After his 1956 life's work manuscript on Vedic mathematics was lost in a fire at the home of a disciple, though he was going blind from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/88931.xml">
cataract</link>s, he re-wrote the manuscript in 1957 in six weeks! It was to be proofread and published in the USA but was send back to India in 1960 after his death. In 1965, this manuscript was published by Motilal Banarsidass, Varanasi, India and reprinted four times in the 1970s.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>
<p>

His book, <it>Vedic Mathematics</it>, included sixteen terse formulas for mental mathematics. For arithmetic, we are given several algorithms for whole number multiplication and division, (flag or straight) division, fraction conversion to repeating decimal numbers, calculations with measures of mixed units, summation of a series, squares and square roots (duplex method), cubes and cube roots (with expressions for a digit schedule), and divisibility (by osculation).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref></p>
<p>

He gives a poem in Anusub metre, couched in the alphabetic Code-Language <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref> that has three meanings, a hymn to Lord Srī Kṛṣṇa, a hymn in praise of the Lord Shri Shankara, and the third the value of pi/10 to 32 decimal places, pi/10 = 0.31415926535897932384626433832792... with a "self-contained master-key" for extending the evaluation to any number of decimal places!<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>
<p>

Several tests and techniques for factoring and solving certain algebraic equations with integer roots for quadratic, cubic, biquadratic, pentic equations, systems of linear equations, and systems of quadratic equations are demonstrated. For fractional expressions, a separation algorithm and fraction merger algorithms are given. Other techniques handle certain patterns of some special case algebraic equations. Just an introduction to differential and integral calculus is given.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref></p>
<p>

Geometric applications are reviewed for linear equations, analytic conics, the equation for the asymptotes, and the equation to the conjugate-hyperbola.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref> Five simple geometric proofs for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../016/23016.xml">
Pythagorean theorem</link> are given.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> A 5-line proof of <statement wordnetid="106722453" confidence="0.8">

 is given.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref></p>
<p>

Advanced topics promised included the integral calculus (the center of gravity of hemispheres, conics), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../261/18717261.xml">
Trigonometry</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/50650.xml">
Astronomy</link> (spherical triangles, earth's daily rotation, earth's annual rotation about the sun and eclipses), and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../251/9251.xml">
Engineering</link> (dynamics, statics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, applied mechanics). <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref></p>
<p>

In his final comments he asserted that the names for "Arabic numerals," "Pythagoras' Theorem," and "Cartesian" co-ordinates are historical misnomers.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>
