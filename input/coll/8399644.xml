User-Centered Information System Design</st>

<p>

Many of Bates' contributions have been in the area of user-centered information system design.  Several of her papers have been widely cited and used, including articles on her concepts of "berrypicking," of "information search tactics," and the "cascade of interactions" in the user-system interface.  <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>  Most recently, her article re-defining the  nature of browsing argues for a more natural and native understanding of the behavior, an understanding that will make possible more realistic browsing interfaces for information systems. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

Information-seeking behavior and subject access</st>

<p>

Bates' work in user-centered design has been based in further work she has done on information seeking behavior and subject access to information resources.  In conjunction with the Getty Research Institute, and other Getty agencies, she has studied humanities information seeking online extensively, producing six articles on the work. In subject access, as early as 1985, she has designed and argued for a "cluster thesaurus" that would bring together all the syntactic and semantic variants of a concept under each concept.  Searches could then match on any term in the cluster, with the searcher able to select subsets of terms for further searching. This was also known as the "front-end system mind." <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

Definition of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/18985062.xml">
information</link></st>

<p>

In her controversial article "Fundamental Forms of Information,"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Bates attempts to define information and several fundamental information forms. She introduced to the field notions of <it>experienced information</it> (what one perceives and thinks about), <it>enacted information</it> (what one does and observes others doing), and <it>expressed information</it> (communicatory expressions).  She further talks about "recorded information" (self-explanatory) and "embedded information."  The latter refers to information structures in the external environments that are created by humans and animals.</p>
<p>

Her definition marks a stark change from the long held definition of information in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../810/248810.xml">
communication theory</link>. The communication model sees information as the flow and exchange of a message, originating from one speaker, mind, or source and received by another. According to Ronald Day, "Implicit in this standard model of information are such notions as the intentionality of the speaker, the self-evident 'presence' of that intention in his or her words, a set of hearers or users who receive the information and who demonstrate the correctness of that reception in action or use, and the freedom of choice in regards to the speaker's ability to say one thing rather than another, as well as even the receivers freedom of choice to receive one message rather than another in the marketplace of ideas."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> </p>
<p>

In contrast, according to Bates, information is the pattern of organization of matter and energy. She believes that all information is natural, in that it exists in the material world of matter and energy. Represented information is natural information that is encoded or embodied. Encoded information is information that has symbolic, linguistic, or signal based patters of organization. Embodied information is the corporal expression of manifestation of information previously in encoded information.</p>
<p>

Bates claims there are three fundamental channels of information: genetic, neural-cultural, and exosomatic. "Genetic and neuro-cultural information are encoded, respectively, as the genotype and as nervous system structures and action potentials. Genetic and neural-cultural information are embodied, respectively, as the phenotype and as experienced information (experience, consciousness), enacted information (actions), and expressed information (communication). Exosomatic information, that is, information stored outside the body, has been developed in complex ways by human beings" and is differentiated as embedded information and recorded information.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> 
Her view of information has been discussed by Hjørland.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> and responded to by Bates.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
