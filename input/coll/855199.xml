<b>Two-tier health care</b> is a form of national <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../976/60976.xml">
health care system</link>.  It is a system in which a guaranteed public health care system exists, but where a private system operates in parallel competition.  The private system provides the opportunity for patients to have more choice in choosing their doctors and benefit from generally shorter waiting times, but is known for being quite costly and reserved only for those who can afford it.  Doctors in the private sector may also benefit financially as they can set their own prices.  Some advanced countries in the world have two-tier primary health care to varying degrees.

, the Healthcare Act prohibits private for-profit health care practices.  </p>

 health discussions where the debate over two-tier health care has long been central. Moving to a two-tier system is supported by conservative <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../101/37101.xml">

.  The potential for profits has created a strong lobby in the health industry, which is today confined to the periphery.  As it stands now, <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 does not have a parallel system: free market health care for Canadians is almost wholly banned in fields covered by the national health system; some private hospitals which were operating when the national health care plan was instituted (for example, the <hospital wordnetid="103540595" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

) continue to operate, although they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures (the Shouldice Hospital does, however, make mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance which place it in the upper tier of  a two-tier system &ndash; welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there). Clinics are usually private operations, but may not bill additional charges. Private health care may also be supplied in uncovered fields and to foreigners.  </p>

The proponents of two-tier system argue that it would introduce more flexibility into the system, reducing wait lists and that competition from the private sector would make the public one more efficient. However, in the case of <district wordnetid="108552138" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../867/7954867.xml">

 this has shown not to be true. Furthermore opponents argue that a two-tier system would tend to draw many of the best doctors out of the public system, reducing the overall quality of care. Some, e.g. <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

 at the Toronto Star, also believe that a two tier approach with private care would be more expensive<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> than single tier health care.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../449/369449.xml">
Canada Health Act</link> is also committed not only to access to health care to all, but access to the best health care available for all.  Many consider access to the best possible care an important right of all citizens.  Competition from the private sector would also almost certainly drive up the wages of doctors and other medical professionals in the entire system. Those who support a wholly public system also say that there is some concern that if Canada would allow a parallel private system within the country, it would be opening itself up to trade sanctions under some of its trading agreements<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>.</p>

The majority of Canadian people are largely opposed to the notion of two-tier health care, and no major political parties currently support the notion. In the <election wordnetid="100181781" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

The phrase is also used in other countries and among health care experts. It is a phrase usually entering into any discussion of health services in the <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

, which has a particularly high rate of private health insurance take-up, and treatment of private patients in public hospitals (thus denying beds and facilities to those on the lower tier of health service). In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../239/9239.xml">
Europe</link>, it often has the same meaning as in the Canadian context, but is used there to describe the status quo.  However, sometimes it has a somewhat different meaning relating to the expansion of private sector involvement through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/2159006.xml">
