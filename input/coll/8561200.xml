<b>Web mapping</b> is the process of designing, implementing, generating and delivering maps on the <invention wordnetid="105633385" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../139/33139.xml">
World Wide Web</link></invention>
. While <b>web mapping</b> primarily deals with technological issues, <b>web <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/7294.xml">
cartography</link></b> additionally studies theoretic aspects: the use of web maps, the evaluation and optimization of techniques and workflows, the usability of web maps, social aspects, and more. <b>Web <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/12398.xml">
GIS</link></b> is similar to web mapping but with an emphasis on analysis, processing of project specific <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/1015518.xml">
geodata</link> and exploratory aspects. Often the terms web <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/12398.xml">
GIS</link> and web mapping are used synonymously, even if they don't mean exactly the same. In fact, the border between web maps and web GIS is blurry. Web maps are often a presentation media in web <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/12398.xml">
GIS</link> and web maps are increasingly gaining analytical capabilities. A special case of web maps are <b>mobile maps</b>, displayed on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../187/657187.xml">
mobile computing</link> devices, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/19644137.xml">
mobile phones</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../079/167079.xml">

 and other devices. If the maps on these devices are displayed by a mobile <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../173/33173.xml">
web browser</link> or web <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../303/487303.xml">
user agent</link>, they can be regarded as <b>mobile web maps</b>. If the mobile web maps also display context and location sensitive information, such as <b>points of interest</b>, the term <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../392/62392.xml">
location based services</link></b> is frequently used.</p>
<p>

The use of the web as a dissemination medium for maps can be regarded as a major advancement in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/7294.xml">
cartography</link> and opens many new opportunities, such as realtime maps, cheaper dissemination, more frequent and cheaper updates of data and software, personalized map content, distributed data sources and sharing of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../518/1015518.xml">
geographic information</link>. It also implicates many challenges due to technical restrictions (low <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/601399.xml">
display resolution</link> and limited <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../827/15612827.xml">
bandwidth</link>, in particular with mobile computing devices, many of which are physically small, and use slow <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../933/1210933.xml">
wireless Internet</link> connections), <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../278/5278.xml">
copyright</link><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> and security issues, reliability issues and technical complexity. While the first web maps were primarily static, due to technical restrictions, today's web maps can be fully <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../528/644528.xml">
interactive</link> and integrate multiple media. This means that both web mapping and web cartography also have to deal with interactivity, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../276/288276.xml">
usability</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../420/20420.xml">
multimedia</link> issues.</p>

Development and implementation</st>

<p>

The advent of web mapping can be regarded as a major new trend in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../294/7294.xml">
cartography</link>. Previously, cartography was restricted to a few 
Map companies|companies, institutes and 
National cartographic agencies|mapping agencies, requiring expensive and complex hard- and software as well as skilled cartographers and geomatics engineers. With web mapping, freely available mapping technologies and geodata potentially allow every skilled person to produce web maps, with expensive geodata and technical complexity (data harmonization, missing standards) being two of the remaining barriers preventing web mapping from fully going mainstream. The cheap and easy transfer of geodata across the internet allows the integration of distributed data sources, opening opportunities that go beyond the possibilities of disjoint data storage. Everyone with minimal knowhow and infrastructure can become a geodata provider. These facts can be regarded both as an advantage and a disadvantage. While it allows everyone to produce maps and considerably enlarges the audience, it also puts geodata in the hands of untrained people who potentially violate cartographic and geographic principles and introduce flaws during the preparation, analysis and presentation of geographic and cartographic data. Educating the general public about geographic analysis and cartographic methods and principles should therefore be a priority to the cartography community.</p>

 Types of web maps </st>

<p>

A first classification of web maps has been made by Kraak.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> He distinguished <it>static</it> and <it>dynamic</it> web maps and further distinguished <it>interactive</it> and <it>view only</it> web maps. However, today in the light of an increased number of different web map types, this classification needs some revision. Today, there are additional possibilities regarding distributed data sources, 
Collaborative mapping|collaborative maps, personalized maps, etc.</p>
<p>

The following graphic lists potential types of web maps. While the graphic shows in principle an order of increasing sophistication, the allocation within the order is not explicit. Many maps fall into more than one category and it is not always clear that a <it>personalized web map</it> is more complex or sophisticated than an <it>interactive web map</it>. Individual web map types are discussed below.</p>

 Dynamically created web maps </st>

<p>

These maps are created on demand each time the user reloads the webpages, often from dynamic data sources, such as databases. The webserver generates the map using a web map server or a self written software.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Distributed web maps </st>

<p>

These maps are created from distributed data sources. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/2414293.xml">
WMS</link> protocol offers a standardized method to access maps on other servers. WMS servers can collect these different sources, reproject the map layers, if necessary, and send them back as a combined image containing all requested map layers. One server may offer a topographic base map, while other servers may offer thematic layers.</p>

</system>
 show changes in the map over time by animating one of the graphical or temporal variables. Various data and multimedia formats and technologies allow the display of animated web maps: <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../751/27751.xml">
SVG</link>, Adobe Flash, Java, Quicktime, etc., also with varying degrees of interaction. Examples for animated web maps are weather maps, maps displaying dynamic natural or other phenomena (such as water currents, wind patterns, traffic flow, trade flow, communication patterns, etc.).</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Realtime web maps </st>

<p>

Realtime maps show the situation of a phenomenon in close to realtime (only a few seconds or minutes delay). Data is collected by sensors and the maps are generated or updated at regular intervals or immediately on demand. Examples are weather maps, traffic maps or vehicle monitoring systems.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Personalized web maps </st>

<p>

Personalized web maps allow the map user to apply his own data filtering, selective content and the application of personal styling and map symbolization. The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../855/1043855.xml">
OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)</link> provides the SLD standard (Styled Layer Description) that may be sent to a WMS server for the application of individual styles. This implies that the content and data structure of the remote WMS server is properly documented.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Open, reusable web maps </st>

<p>

Web maps in this category are usually more complex web mapping systems that offer APIs for reuse in other people's web pages and products. An example for such a system with an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/24th_century.xml">
API</link> for reuse is <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://maps.google.com/">
Google Maps</weblink> with the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">
Google Maps API</weblink>.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Interactive web maps </st>

<p>

Interactivity is one of the major advantages of screen based maps and web maps. It helps to compensate for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22limited+screen+space%22])">
disadvantages of screen and web maps</link>. Interactivity helps to explore maps, change map parameters, navigate and interact with the map, reveal additional information, link to other resources, and much more. Technically, it is achieved through the combination of events, scripting and DOM manipulations. See section on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Client+Side+Technologies%22])">
Client Side Technologies</link>.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Analytic web maps </st>

<p>

These web maps offer GIS analysis, either with geodata provided, or with geodata uploaded by the map user. As already mentioned, the borderline between analytic web maps and web GIS is blurry. Often, parts of the analysis are carried out by a serverside GIS and the client displays the result of the analysis. As web clients gain more and more capabilities, this task sharing may gradually shift.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Online atlases </st>
<p>

Atlas projects often went through a renaissance when they made a transition to a web based project. In the past, atlas projects often suffered from expensive map production, small circulation and limited audience. Updates were expensive to produce and took a long time until they hit the public. Many atlas projects, after moving to the web, can now reach a wider audience, produce cheaper, provide a larger number of maps and map types and integrate with and benefit from other web resources. Some atlases even ceased their printed editions after going online, sometimes offering printing on demand features from the online edition. Some atlases (primarily from North America) also offer raw data downloads of the underlying geospatial data sources.</p>

 Disadvantages of web maps and problematic issues </st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Reliability issues</it> – the reliability of the internet and web server infrastructure is not yet good enough. Esp. if a web map relies on external, distributed data sources, the original author often cannot guarantee the availability of the information.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Geodata is expensive</it> – Unlike in the US, where geodata collected by governmental institutions is usually available for free or cheap, geodata is usually very expensive in Europe or other parts of the world.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Bandwidth issues</it> – Web maps usually need a relatively high bandwidth.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Limited screen space</it> – Like with other screen based maps, web maps have the problem of limited screen space. This is in particular a problem for mobile web maps and location based services where maps have to be displayed in very small screens with resolutions as low as 100×100 pixels. Hopefully, technological advances will help to overcome these limitations.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Quality and accuracy issues</it> – Many web maps are of poor quality, both in symbolization, content and data accuracy.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Complex to develop</it> – Despite the increasing availability of free and commercial tools to create web mapping and web GIS applications, it is still a complex task to create interactive web maps. Many technologies, modules, services and data sources have to be mastered and integrated.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Immature development tools</it> – Compared to the development of standalone applications with integrated development tools, the development and debugging environments of a conglomerate of different web technologies is still awkward and uncomfortable.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Copyright issues</it> – Many people are still reluctant to publish geodata, esp. in the light that geodata is expensive in some parts of the world. They fear copyright infringements of other people using their data without proper requests for permission.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <it>Privacy issues</it> – With detailed information available and the combination of distributed data sources, it is possible to find out and combine a lot of private and personal information of individual persons. Properties and estates of individuals are now accessible through high resolution aerial and satellite images throughout the world to anyone.</entry>

 Web mapping technologies </st>

<p>

The potential number of technologies to implement web mapping projects is almost infinite. Any programming environment, programming language and serverside framework can be used to implement web mapping projects. In any case, both server and client side technologies have to be used. Following is a list of potential and popular server and client side technologies utilized for web mapping.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
 Server side technologies </st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Web server</b> – The webserver is responsible for handling http requests by web browsers and other user agents. In the simplest case they serve static files, such as HTML pages or static image files. Web servers also handle authentication, content negotiation, server side includes, URL rewriting and forward requests to dynamic resources, such as CGI applications or serverside scripting languages. The functionality of a webserver can usually be enhanced using modules or extensions. The most popular web server is <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../581/2581.xml">
Apache</link></software>
, followed by <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../050/209050.xml">
Microsoft Internet Information Server</link></software>
 and others.</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/7220.xml">
CGI (common gateway interface)</link></b> applications are executables running on the webserver under the environment and user permissions of the webserver user. They may be written in any programming language (compiled) or scripting language (e.g. perl). A CGI application implements the common gateway interface protocol, processes the information sent by the client, does whatever the application should do and sends the result back in a web-readable form to the client. As an example a web browser may send a request to a CGI application for getting a web map with a certain map extent, styling and map layer combination. The result is an image format, e.g. JPEG, PNG or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../751/27751.xml">
SVG</link>. For performance enhancements one can also install CGI applications as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../487/1637487.xml">
FastCGI</link>. This loads the application after the web server is started and keeps the application in memory, eliminating the need to spawn a separate process each time a request is being made.</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 Alternatively, one can use <b>scripting languages built into the webserver</b> as a module, such as PHP, Perl, Python, ASP, Ruby, etc. If built into the web server as a module, the scripting engine is already loaded and doesn't have to be loaded each time a request is being made.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Web application servers</b> are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/57183.xml">
middleware</link> which connects various software components with the web server and a programming language. As an example, a web application server can enable the communication between the API of a GIS and the webserver, a spatial database or other proprietary applications. Typical web application servers are written in Java, C, C++, C# or other scripting languages. Web application servers are also useful when developing complex realtime web mapping applications or Web GIS.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../551/4533551.xml">
Spatial databases</link></b> are usually object relational databases enhanced with geographic data types, methods and properties. They are necessary whenever a web mapping application has to deal with dynamic data (that changes frequently) or with huge amount of geographic data. Spatial databases allow spatial queries, sub selects, reprojections, geometry manipulations and offer various import and export formats. A popular example for an open source spatial database is <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 <b><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/2414293.xml">
WMS server</link></b> are specialized web mapping servers implemented as a CGI application, Java Servlet or other web application server. They either work as a standalone web server or in collaboration with existing web servers or web application servers (the general case). WMS Servers can generate maps on request, using parameters, such as map layer order, styling/symbolization, map extent, data format, projection, etc. The OGC Consortium defined the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/2414293.xml">

 <b>Network requests</b> – This is necessary to load additional data and content into a web page. Most modern browsers provide the XMLHttpRequest object which allows for get and post http requests and provides some feedback on the data loading state. The data received can be processed by ECMAScript and can be included into the current DOM tree of the web page / web map. SVG user agents alternatively provide the getURL() and postURL() methods for network requests. It is recommended to test for the existence of a network request method and provide alternatives if one method isn't present. As an example, a wrapper function could handle the network requests and test whether XMLHttpRequests or getURL() or alternative methods are available and choose the best one available. These network requests are also known under the term <word wordnetid="106286395" confidence="0.8">

<b>SVG support or SVG image support</b></weblink> – SVG is the abbreviation of "Scalable Vector Graphics" and integrates vector graphics, raster graphics and text. SVG also supports animation, internationalization, interactivity, scripting and XML based extension mechanisms. SVG is a huge step forward when it comes to delivering high quality, interactive maps. At the time of writing (2007–01), SVG is natively supported in Mozilla/Firefox &amp;gt;version 1.5, Opera &amp;gt;version 9 and the developer version of Safari/Webkit. Internet Explorer users still need the Adobe SVG viewer plugin provided by Adobe. For a German book on web mapping with SVG see<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> and for an English paper on SVG mapping see.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></entry>

 <b>Java support</b> – some browsers still provide old versions of the Java virtual machine. An alternative is the use of the Sun Java Plugin. Java is a full featured programming language that can be used to create very sophisticated and interactive web maps. The Java2D and Java3D libraries provide 2d and 3d vector graphics support. The creation of Java based web maps requires a lot of programming know how. Adrian Herzog (<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> discusses the use of Java applets for the presentation of interactive choroplethe and cartogram maps. </entry>
