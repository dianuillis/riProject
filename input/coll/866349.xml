<b>Computervision, Inc.</b> (CV) was an early pioneer in turnkey Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../315/37315.xml">
CAD</link>/<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/162289.xml">
CAM</link>) company. Computervision was founded in 1969 by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../241/1672241.xml">
Marty Allen</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/4599490.xml">
Philippe Villers</link>, and headquartered in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

Massachusetts</link></country>
, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../750/3434750.xml">
USA</link>.  Its early products were built on a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/8654.xml">
Data General Nova</link> platform. Starting around 1975, Computervision built its own "CGP" (Computervision Graphics Processor) Nova-compatible 16-bit computers with added instructions optimized for graphics applications and using its own <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../194/22194.xml">
operating system</link> known as Computervision Graphic Operating System (CGOS). In the 1980s, Computervision transitioned to <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">

.<p>

Computervision's first product, CADDS-1, was aimed at the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../910/65910.xml">
printed circuit board</link> layout and 2-D <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../952/54952.xml">
drafting</link> markets. CADDS stood for Computervison Automated Design and Drafting System.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/15150.xml">
Integrated circuit</link> layout was added with the CADDS-2 product, which had a dedicated operating system and a 16-bit graphic database. When this proved insufficient resolution for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../823/32823.xml">
VLSI</link> (very large scale integration), the company developed CADDS-2/VLSI in the late 1970s. CADDS-2/VLSI included a new operating system, a 32-bit database, and user expandability through a dedicated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/23015.xml">
programming language</link> called <link>
ICPL</link> (integrated circuit programming language), which was a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../744/948744.xml">
dialect</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/4015.xml">
BASIC</link>, based on an interpreter licensed from Fairchild Semiconductor. The original CADDS-2 ran on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/8654.xml">
Data General Nova</link> 1200 computers. CADDS-2/VLSI ran on Computervision's own hardware which were modified <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/8654.xml">
Data General Nova</link>'s and modified version of DG's operating systems.</p>
<p>

CADDS3 was introduced in the late 1970s on the CGP80 and CGP100 using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../213/659213.xml">
Tektronix</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/1045015.xml">
storage tube</link> vector devices.</p>
<p>

Usable 3-D design was added in the early 1980s with the CADDS4 product on the CGP200. This version of CADDS moved display technology from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../015/1045015.xml">
storage tube</link> base displays to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../742/25742.xml">
raster graphics</link> and introduced the dedicated graphics co-processor board known as the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). </p>
<p>

With CADDS4 Tailored packages were available for CAD drafting, CAM (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../289/162289.xml">
computer-aided manufacturing</link>), 3-D modeling, piping and plant design, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../520/49520.xml">
printed circuit</link> board layout, instrument panel design, and many other applications. During this period, they also contributed to the development of the <message wordnetid="106598915" confidence="0.8">

 and other competitors.</p>
<p>

The major breakthrough in 3-D Design was with the CADDS4X on the CGP200X running CGOS200X. This version of the operating system and hardware improved memory management (not true virtual memory) and increased program size. In 1984 a cluster of CGP200X with a proprietary 32-bit processor Analytic Processing Unit (APU) was offered as the Computervision Design System (CDS) 4000. The APU was sometimes called "All Paws Up".</p>

In 1985, CV introduced an <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/18622259.xml">

 4361 based mainframe known as the CDS5000 to support Product Data Manager (PDM). This system never ran any a graphics software but instead was used to manage the large number of product files and data that users were generating. The CDS5000 was networked with CDS4000 and CGP200X systems using serial links.</p>
