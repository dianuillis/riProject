 History </st>

From <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.afotec.af.mil">

<p>

"<b>The Beginning</b>
"Like today’s Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, the Air Proving Ground was independent of the developer and reported directly to the Chief of Staff. Created in 1941 by the Army Air Corps, the Air Proving Ground tested new aircraft in their operational roles as they came off the assembly lines. Unlike the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center the Air Proving Ground did not involve itself with the early development of the weapon systems it tested. In 1948 shortly after the Air Force gained its independence from the Army, the Air Proving Ground became the Air Proving Ground Command, one of the major commands of the fledgling United States Air Force. The Air Proving Ground Command conducted realistic testing on new weapons until 1957 when it was abolished by the Air Force due to budget cuts. What little remained of the old Air Proving Ground Command became a small test center that evolved into today’s Air Armament Center located at Eglin AFB, Florida. From 1958 to 1973, the United States Air Force relied on decentralized operational testing conducted by the major commands. The existing alignment of Air Force test and evaluation responsibilities appeared to pose a conflict of interest detrimental to objective decision making. Often the emphasis for using commands was the quick deployment of weapons systems rather than thoroughly testing them and rendering impartial evaluations. This emphasis became clear during the Vietnam conflict between 1965 and 1970 when, according to Department of Defense conducted studies, 21 of 22 major weapon systems in use at that time suffered severe operational deficiencies in the field.</p>
<p>

"<b>Air Force Test and Evaluation Center Established</b>
"From 1970 to 1973 several committees, commissions, and other government entities examined the problem of independent operational test and evaluation. In July 1970 the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel concluded that operational test and evaluation was most effective when the testing organization reported directly to the Chief of the Services and represented both the developer and the user, but remained organizationally independent. Later in September 1970, the Bolender Committee study recommended developing an Air Force program that integrated essential operational test and evaluation requirements and served as the basis for Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation. Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Packard directed in July 1971, that results of operational testing would be evaluated and presented to the Defense Systems Acquisition Review Council at the production decision milestone. Later, in November 1971, Congress, in Public Law 92-156, required that beginning with Calendar Year 1973 an operational test and evaluation report be prepared for each weapon system that requested funds for procurement. The Commission on Government Procurement, in December 1972, recommended the establishment of an operational test and evaluation activity independent of the developer and user organizations, similar to the old Air Proving Ground Command. The General Accounting Office in March 1973 recommended the establishment of an operational test and evaluation activity in each military department independent of the developer and user. Based on this recommendation the Chief of Staff of the Air Force ordered the establishment of the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center in late 1973. The Air Force activated the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center in January 1974 at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, and the Center became fully operational later that same year in October 1974. The new test center’s charter avoided creation of another Air Proving Ground Command, the large major command that had been responsible for operational testing and evaluation from 1948 to1957. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force restricted the size and scope of the new center and allowed the major commands to retain the majority of operational test and evaluation programs. The Air Force Test and Evaluation Center started its operational career as a small management headquarters that focused on the evaluation of major weapon systems, such as the E-3A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System, one of the first systems the Center operationally tested, as well as monitoring smaller acquisition programs. In July 1976 the Air Force revised its test and evaluation regulations. These revisions eliminated duplicate testing responsibilities; fixed responsibility for overall management of test and evaluation; assured dedicated initial operational test and evaluation as early as possible; and confirmed the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center’s control over operational test and evaluation team resources during specific initial operational test and evaluation programs. In 1983 the Air Force added “Operational” to the center’s name to more accurately describe its mission. In late 1991, the Air Force broadened the responsibilities of the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center to encompass operational test and evaluation programs previously conducted by the major commands. In 1997, the Center’s mission expanded further when the advanced concept and other non-traditional testing programs formerly conducted by the Defense Evaluation Support Activity were realigned under the Center.</p>
<p>

"<b>Air Force Test and Evaluation Center Today</b>
"Today the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center oversees six detachments, four of which are geographically separated from the headquarters at Kirtland AFB, and other remote operating locations scattered across the United States. From its first involvement with the E-3A Sentry, the Center has conducted operational testing and evaluation on such current Air Force acquisition programs as the F/A-22 Raptor, CV-22 Osprey, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. But, these are only a few of the hundreds of test programs that the Center has been or is currently involved with. For more than three decades, the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center has been the focal point for operational testing and evaluation and has contributed significantly to the successful acquisition and operational employment of numerous weapon and support systems for all branches of the armed forces, other governmental agencies, and our allies."</p>

 Operations </st>

<p>

AFOTEC assesses the capability of new systems to meet warfighter needs by planning, executing and reporting independent operational evaluations. From concept development through system employment, AFOTEC provides effectiveness, suitability and operational impact expertise in the battlespace environment.</p>
<p>

AFOTEC employs approximately 1,100 military, civilian, and contractor personnel at its headquarters, six detachments at Edwards AFB, Calif., Eglin AFB, Fla., Nellis AFB, Nev., Peterson AFB, Colo. and Kirtland AFB, N.M.; and more than 20 operating locations. The commander of AFOTEC reports directly to the chief of staff of the Air Force. </p>
<p>

Test teams conduct tests at selected sites; collect, analyze and evaluate the data and prepare formal reports. The teams are managed by AFOTEC and include personnel from the operating and supporting commands who will eventually employ these systems.</p>
<p>

<b>Test Program</b></p>
<p>

AFOTEC's independent and objective evaluations of how well systems will meet operational requirements provide a vital link between the developer and user. They are key elements of the system acquisition approval process.</p>
<p>

Operational tests are designed to address critical issues regarding a system's performance in combat-like environments when operated by field personnel. They seek to answer questions about how safe, effective, reliable, maintainable, compatible and logistically supportable new Air Force systems will be.</p>
<p>

The results of AFOTEC's tests, normally conducted on prototype and pre-production models, play an important role in Air Force and DOD acquisition decisions. Test results also identify deficiencies requiring corrective action.</p>

<p>

The Air Force activated the <b>Air Force Test and Evaluation Center</b> as a separate operating agency reporting directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../787/15787.xml">
1 January</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../654/34654.xml">
1974</link> at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M. The Center achieved initial operational capability in April 1974 and full operational capability by October 1974.</p>
<p>

On <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../826/18951826.xml">
4 April</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/34755.xml">
1983</link>, the Center was redesignated the <b>Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center</b> to clearly delineate its role as the Air Force's operational test agency. The Air Force redesignated AFOTEC a <link>

5 February</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../703/34703.xml">
1991</link>. Later in 1991, the Air Force broadened AFOTEC's responsibilities by re-assigning all initial, qualification and selected follow-on operational tests and evaluations from the major commands to the Center.</p>
<p>

AFOTEC's test and evaluation mission further expanded in 1997 when the Center absorbed the "non-traditional" testing mission of the disbanded Defense Evaluation Support Activity.</p>

 Emblem </st>
<p>

Approved on 25 September 1974, the AFOTEC emblem features four blue and gold deltoids.  The deltoids are symbolic of the Air Force acting as an instrument of national policy and represent four fundamental military objectives of the United States:  to deter aggression; to resolve conflicts on favorable terms; to achieve national objectives; and to promote a secure international environment.</p>
<p>

The blue-gold deltoid color scheme divides the four fundamental tasks into eight equal segments which signify major operational tasks assigned to the Air Force: 1) strategic air warfare; 2) counter air; 3) air interdiction; 4) close air support; 5) aerospace defense; 6) air reconnaissance; 7) electronic warfare; and 8) airlift. </p>
<p>

The ultramarine blue segments represent the sky (near earth) which is the primary environment for Air Force operations. The golden yellow segments represent the sun (directionally depicted rising from the east and setting in the west as indicated by the deltoids) and the excellence required of Center personnel.</p>
<p>

White contrails, which trail the deltoids, signify the test and evaluation process that follows concept formulation, validation, and full-scale development of systems and equipment.</p>
<p>

The red scales portray AFOTEC’s impartial and independent assessment of a system’s value when weighed against the fundamental military tasks and Air Force roles and missions.</p>
<p>

Heraldic Description: Light blue, issuing from base four contrails palewise argent terminating below four deltoids ascending, one in dexter flank, two in chief and one in sinister flank, the dexter two or and azure, and the sinister two of the like and or; surmounting the vapor trails a pair of scales gules, all within a diminished bordure gold.</p>
