He initially entertained them with his playful antics such as dancing with his dog Porthos, wiggling his ears, and performing feats with his eyebrows, and further endeared himself to them with his stories.  He became a regular part of their lives, whom they came to call "Uncle Jim".</p>

In addition to the time the boys spent with Barrie in Kensington Gardens and at the Davies home, the family accompanied him to his retreat Black Lake Cottage, where George, Jack, and Peter were the subjects of <it>The Boy Castaways</it>, a photobook made by Barrie about their play adventures living on an island and fighting pirates.

Their father died of a salivary <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../196/288196.xml">
sarcoma</link> in 1907, and their mother died of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../219/105219.xml">
cancer</link> in 1910.  Over the course of their illnesses, Barrie became more involved with the family, including providing financial support for them.  With Sylvia's death, Barrie became the boys' trustee and guardian (though never in the legal sense), along with their maternal grandmother Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's brother Guy du Maurier, and Arthur's brother Compton Llewelyn Davies.  Mary Hodgson continued to care for them, until increasing friction with Barrie and a confrontation with Jack's new wife led to her resignation when the boys were in their teens and twenties.  Barrie, whose success as a novelist and playwright made him wealthy, provided housing, education, and financial support for them until they were independent.</p>

Relationship with Barrie</st>

<p>

Although there has often been suspicion about the nature of Barrie's relationship with the Davies boys, there is no evidence that he engaged in any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../790/18721790.xml">
sexual activity</link> with them, nor that there was any suspicion of such at the time.  Their father Arthur was troubled by Barrie's relationship with them, but that was based on its interference with his own relationship with them as their father, and he didn't care for the man personally.  As an adult, Nico flatly denied any inappropriate behavior or intentions by Barrie.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> "I don't believe that Uncle Jim ever experienced what one might call 'a stirring in the undergrowth' for anyone — man, woman, or child," he wrote to biographer <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

<p>

The boys' relationships with Barrie varied.  George and Michael were very close to him, and their deaths affected him strongly.  Jack harbored some resentment of Barrie for taking his father's place during and after Arthur's illness.  Peter's relationship with Barrie was ambivalent, but Nico adored him.</p>
