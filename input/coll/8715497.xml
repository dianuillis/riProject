<b>HCF (Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia)</b> was formed in 1932 to provide health insurance cover to Australians. Since then, it has grown to become one of the country’s largest combined registered private health fund and life insurance organisations. </p>
<p>

HCF provides private health insurance cover for a full range of health benefits including private hospital, Australia-wide ambulance cover and ancillary services. HCF is financially secure and is one of the few major health funds to allow contributors to vote for Directors to the Board. </p>

 History </st>

<p>

In 1932, following negotiations between HSF and a newly created Hospital Commission of NSW, a new fund was created to better serve the community. The new fund – called the Metropolitan Hospitals Contribution Fund – was launched on Friday June 16, 1932.</p>
<p>

In 1967, HCF formally changed its name to The Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia and established further offices around the country.</p>
<p>

1982 saw the establishment by HCF of a wholly owned subsidiary company, HCF Life Insurance Pty Ltd. </p>
<p>

In June 2000, HCF established The HCF Health and Medical Research Foundation. The Foundation is a not for profit charitable trust established to encourage medical research of all kinds and 
research and enquiry into the provision, administration and delivery of health services in Australia for the benefit of HCF contributors and the public generally.</p>
<p>

Today HCF has branches located in NSW, Victoria, ACT, SA and Queensland.</p>
<p>

HCF has proposed a merger with Manchester Unity, and the Manchester Unity Board has accepted. The merger is currently subject to policyholder approval.</p>
<p>

The current CEO is Terry Smith.</p>
