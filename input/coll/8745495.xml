William L. Johnson has held starring and prominent roles in many theatrically released projects. His performance as a lead in director Craig Ross' <it><movie wordnetid="106613686" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../197/18550197.xml">

<p>

Johnson's acting diversity has been displayed in several independent short films and features such as <it>Move</it>, <it>Wanted: Soulful Energy Xchange</it> with Gary Dourdan and Mari Morrow, director Tony Spires' <it>Two Degrees</it> starring Don "DC' Curry, and Nikita Blues from Foremost Entertainment.

 and <link>

<p>

Equally important to Johnson is his passion to deliver conscious messages through his music via his stage persona "Brotha Bill". Brotha Bill's essence is a lyrical flow that sets him apart from other neo-soul artists. Those who have experienced his fusion of poetic verse and energetic <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../168/26168.xml">
R&amp;B</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../778/10778.xml">

Upon relocating to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../110/18110.xml">
Los Angeles</link> in 1998 Johnson quickly gained a name for himself as a very talented and versatile actor starring in films that have won accolades at top film festivals. Claiming <village wordnetid="108672738" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../886/6886.xml">
Chicago, Illinois</link> as hometowns, Johnson has steadily improved his craft in the Los Angeles entertainment scene for the past six years. His music career was spawned at an early age upon matriculation to Emerson Visual and Performing Arts High School. Soon after graduation he formed a group, Black to Black, which was nurtured by notable manager Jimmy Newton. In 1999, Johnson and prominent producer/engineer Booker T. Jones conceived BaldHeadDread, which garnered significant exposure when they scored the movie soundtrack for Ragdoll. Both projects were stepping stones to help him launch his solo venture. </p>
