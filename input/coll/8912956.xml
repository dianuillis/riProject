Programming by demonstration (PbD) is a technique for teaching a
computer or a robot new behaviors by demonstrating the task to
transfer directly instead of programming it through machine
commands.<p>

</paradigm>
 (PbE) or Programming by
demonstration (PbD) appeared in software development research as early as
the mid 1980s<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>
to define a way to define a sequence of operations without having to learn a programming
language. The usual distinction in literature between these terms is that in Programming by example the user gives a prototypical product of the computer execution, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/2271084.xml">
a row in the desired results of a query</link>; while in Programming by demonstration the user performs a sequence of actions that the computer must repeat, generalizing it to be used in different data sets.</p>
<p>

These two terms were first undifferentiated, but <paradigm wordnetid="113804375" confidence="0.8">

 then tended to be mostly adopted by software development researchers while Programming by Demonstration tended to be adopted by robotics researchers.</p>

<p>

The PbD paradigm is first attractive to the robotics industry due
to the costs involved in the development and maintenance of robot
programs. In this field, the operator often has implicit knowledge
on the task to achieve (he/she knows how to do it), but does not
have usually the programming skills (or the time) required to
reconfigure the robot. Demonstrating how to achieve the task
through examples thus allows to learn the skill without explicitly
programming each detail.</p>
<p>

The first PbD strategies proposed in robotics were based on
<it>teach-in</it>, <it>guiding</it> or <it>play-back</it> methods that consisted
basically in moving the robot (through a dedicated interface or
manually) through a set of relevant configurations that the robot
should adopt sequentially (position, orientation, state of the
gripper). The method was then progressively ameliorated by
focusing principally on the teleoperation control and by using
different interfaces such as vision.</p>
<p>

However, these PbD methods still used direct repetition, which was
useful in industry only when conceiving an assembly line using
exactly the same product components. To apply this concept to
products with different variants or to apply the programs to new
robots, the generalization issue became a crucial point. To
address this issue, the first attempts at generalizing the skill
were mainly based on the help of the user through queries about
the user's intentions. Then, different levels of abstractions were
proposed to resolve the generalization issue, basically
dichotomized in learning methods at a symbolic level or at a
trajectory level.</p>
<p>

The development of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../180/48180.xml">
humanoid robots</link> naturally brought a growing
interest in robot programming by demonstration. As a humanoid
robot is supposed by its nature to adapt to new environments, not
only the human appearance is important but the algorithms used for
its control require flexibility and versatility. Due to the
continuously changing environments and to the huge varieties of
tasks that a robot is expected to perform, the robot requires the
ability to continuously learn new skills and adapt the existing
skills to new contexts.</p>
<p>

Research in PbD also progressively departed from its original
purely engineering perspective to adopt an interdisciplinary
approach, taking insights from neuroscience and social sciences to
emulate the process of imitation in humans and animals. With the
increasing consideration of this body of work in robotics, the
notion of <it>Robot programming by demonstration</it> (also known as
RPD or RbD) was also progressively replaced by the more biological
label of <it>Learning by imitation</it>.</p>
