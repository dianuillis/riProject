. 
The book deals with the idea that thought, intelligence or reason can be reduced to computation. After a summary of the idea's history Dreyfus proceeds to attack this project, and show why it is impossible, regardless of the claims of the <link>
Artificial Intelligence</link> (AI) research community. No other book has ever produced as much controversy and emotion in the Artificial Intelligence community. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

The book's argument</st>
<p>

Dreyfus summarizes the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../560/2894560.xml">
History of artificial intelligence</link> both as a conceptual aspiration (up to the 20th century) and as a technology (since). The book takes great exception to the unwarranted optimism that seems to permeate the field, for example. <person wordnetid="100007846" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<scientist wordnetid="110560637" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

</person>
, following his <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../658/1234658.xml">

 most theories in psychology will take the form of computer programs.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Dreyfus also ridicules the public's credulity regarding anything robotic or <link>
Artificial Intelligence</link>-related, e.g. quoting  
the following claim from a US newspaper, in 1968:</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../698/1557698.xml">
Cosmos</link>, the West German publishing house... has come up with a new idea in gifts... It's a genuine (if small) computer, and it costs about $20. Battery operated, it looks like a portable typewriter. But it can be programmed like any big computer to translate foreign languages, diagnose illnesses, even provide a weather forecast.</p>

<p>

Within this atmosphere of wild optimism no critical discussion of any underlying conceptual difficulties is allowed. Dreyfus points out major differences between Human's and machine's thought that Artificial Intelligence research stumbles across time and again:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Fringe consciousness vs. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../509/846509.xml">
Heuristically guided search</link></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Ambiguity tolerance vs. context-free precision</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Essential/inessential discrimination vs. trial-and-error search</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Perspicuous Grouping vs. Character Lists</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

These difficulties are not coincidental. 
All work in Cognitive Simulation and in Artificial Intelligence is predicated on one basic assumption: that Humans in some fundamental way process information in ways that computers can emulate. This is no small assumption, because all computer-based information is explicit, discrete, linear, rule-based and definitive, while we have no evidence that human thought is so. The assumption that human minds function like general-purpose symbol-manipulating machines amounts to:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 A <it>Biological Assumption</it> - That at some level people operate in a digital manner</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 A <it>Psychological Assumption</it> - All thought is calculation</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 An <it>Epistemological Assumption</it> - That all knowledge can be formalized</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

 An <it>Ontological Assumption</it> - That our world consists of context-free facts</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

All these assumptions would be very convenient if they were true, however there is little evidence to support them and much to refute.</p>
<p>

Dreyfus argues for the role of the body in intelligent behavior, for the importance of the overall situation for orderly behavior, and the inapplicability of any rule-set. He also stresses the importance of specifically Human needs as determinators of the situation (in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../304/37304.xml">
Heidegger</link>ian sense) which is the context in which the interpretation of the world occurs. </p>
<p>

The book concludes with a chart classifying intelligent activities (quoted):
