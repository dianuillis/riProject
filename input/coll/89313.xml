Cooperatives as legal entities</st>
<p>

Although the term may be used loosely to describe a way of working, a cooperative properly so-called is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../287/219287.xml">
legal entity</link> owned and democratically controlled equally by its members. A defining point of a cooperative is that the members have a close association with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products or services, or as its employees.</p>
<p>

In some countries, there are specific forms of incorporation for co-operatives.  Cooperatives may take the form of companies limited by shares or by guarantee, partnerships or unincorporated associations. In the USA, cooperatives are often organized as non-capital stock corporations under state-specific cooperative laws. However, they may also be unincorporated associations or business corporations such as limited liability companies or partnerships; such forms are useful when the members want to allow:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

some members to have a greater share of the control, or</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

some investors to have a return on their capital that exceeds fixed interest,</entry>
</list>

neither of which may be allowed under local laws for cooperatives. Cooperatives often share their earnings with the membership as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../930/41930.xml">
dividend</link>s, which are divided among the members according to their participation in the enterprise, such as patronage, instead of according to the value of their capital shareholdings (as is done by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../024/362024.xml">
joint stock company</link>.)</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Co-operative identity</st>
<p>

Cooperatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy and equality. In the tradition of their founders, cooperative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others. Such legal entities have a range of unique social characteristics. Membership is open, meaning that anyone who satisfies certain non-discriminatory conditions may join. Economic benefits are distributed proportionally according to each member's level of participation in the cooperative, for instance by a dividend on sales or purchases, rather than divided according to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/181293.xml">
capital</link> invested. Cooperatives may be generally classified as either <b>consumer cooperatives</b> or <b>producer cooperatives</b>. Cooperatives are closely related to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../369/766369.xml">
collectives</link>, which differ only in that profit-making or economic stability is placed secondary to adherence to social-justice principles.</p>

Members of a building cooperative (in Britain known as a self-build housing co-operative) pool resources to build housing, normally using a high proportion of their own labour. When the building is finished, each member is the sole owner of a homestead, and the cooperative may be dissolved.</p>
<p>

<b>Business and employment co-operatives</b> (BECs) are a subset of worker co-operatives that represent a new approach to providing support to the creation of new businesses.</p>
<p>

Like other business creation support schemes, BECs enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with their business idea while benefiting from a secure income.</p>
<p>

The innovation BECs introduce is that once the business is established the entrepreneur is not forced to leave and set up independently, but can stay and become a full member of the co-operative.</p>
<p>

The micro-enterprises thus combine to form one multi-activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for each other.</p>
<p>

BECs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition from inactivity to self-employment, but in a collective framework. They open up new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence needed to set off entirely on their own – or who simply want to carry on an independent economic activity but within a supportive group context.</p>

A particularly successful form of multi-stakeholder cooperative is the Italian "social cooperative", of which some 7,000 exist. "Type A" social cooperatives bring together providers and beneficiaries of a social service as members. "Type B" social cooperatives bring together permanent workers and previously unemployed people who wish to integrate into the labour market.</p>
<p>

Social cooperatives are legally defined as follows:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

no more than 80% of profits may be distributed, interest is limited to the bond rate and dissolution is altruistic (assets may not be distributed)</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

the cooperative has legal personality and limited liability</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

the objective is the general benefit of the community and the social integration of citizens</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

those of type B integrate disadvantaged people into the labour market. The categories of disadvantage they target may include physical and mental disability, drug and alcohol addiction, developmental disorders and problems with the law. They do not include other factors of disadvantage such as race, sexual orientation or abuse.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

type A cooperatives provide health, social or educational services</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

various categories of stakeholder may become members, including paid employees, beneficiaries, volunteers (up to 50% of members), financial investors and public institutions. In type B co-operatives at least 30% of the members must be from the disadvantaged target groups</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

voting is one person one vote</entry>
</list>

 (Istat) figures from the end of 2001 by an annual growth rate of 10% (assumed by the <it>Direzione Generale per gli Ente Cooperativi</it>). This gives totals of 7,100 social cooperatives, with 267,000 members, 223,000 paid employees, 31,000 volunteers and 24,000 disadvantaged people undergoing integration. Combined turnover is around 5 billion euro. The cooperatives break into three types: 59% type A (social and health services), 33% type B (work integration) and 8% mixed. The average size is 30 workers.

A consumers' cooperative is a business owned by its customers.  Employees can also generally become members. Members vote on major decisions, and elect the board of directors from amongst their own number.

Japan has a very large and well developed consumer cooperative movement with over 14 million members; retail co-ops alone had a combined turnover of 2.519&nbsp;trillion&nbsp;Yen (21.184&nbsp;billion&nbsp;US&nbsp;dollars [market exchange rates as of 11/15/2005]) in 2003/4.

Nowadays, a large part of the Swiss population are members of the Migros cooperative – around 2 million of Switzerland's total population of 7,2 million[1] [2], thus making Migros a supermarket chain that is owned by its customers.</p>

Agricultural cooperatives</link> are widespread in rural areas.

There are also <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/2330138.xml">
