What would eventually become Taligent started in a roundabout way in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/34670.xml">
1988</link>. After <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../856/856.xml">
Apple Computer</link>'s latest effort to develop a new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../979/19006979.xml">

, a new version of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../043/20043.xml">
Mac OS</link> had been developed to support it, <it>System 6.0</it>. During the initial planning for the operating system to follow System 6.0, new ideas were written down on index cards. Ideas that were simple and could be included in a new version of the existing software were written on blue colored cards, those that were more advanced or took longer to implement were written on pink cards.
A new operating system, code-named <b>Pink</b>, was planned based on the ideas written on the pink index cards. Pink was to be a completely new object-oriented OS implemented in <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../038/72038.xml">
C++</link></programming_language>
 on top of a new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../023/20023.xml">
microkernel</link>, running a new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/12293.xml">
GUI</link> that nevertheless looked and felt like the existing Mac. In addition to running programs written for Pink, the system was to be capable of running existing Mac OS programs.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Development begins</st>
<p>

Efforts to develop Pink started around 1989, although at the time the effort was primarily a research effort.</p>
<p>

By this time, however, the team writing the system based on the blue cards (now known as the "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../417/2303417.xml">
Blue Meanies</link>") were well advanced on what would be released in 1991 as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../354/345354.xml">
System 7</link>. The problem was that System 7 was so large in memory terms that it would barely fit into existing Macintosh models, meaning that if Pink were going to run Mac OS programs by emulating System 7, it would have no room left over for itself.</p>
<p>

Meanwhile, <link>
corporate immune response</link> within Apple doomed Pink. To those working on Blue, Pink was seen as a project that might steal <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/240799.xml">
mind share</link> from their own work. As the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../480/174480.xml">
turf war</link> grew, engineers started to abandon Pink to work on Blue, and whole projects were brought into one group or another in a huge flurry of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/1361712.xml">
empire-building</link>. </p>
<p>

Magazines throughout the early 1990s showed various mock-ups of what Pink would be like. One true innovation of the system was the <it>People, Places and Things</it> metaphor that attempted to provide the user with tools to easily move documents around between people and things (like fax machines) as easily as they could print them using current technologies. The system also added a component-based document model that was similar to Apple's <software wordnetid="106566077" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../260/190260.xml">
OpenDoc</link></software>
. This concept was missing from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/53114.xml">
OpenStep</link>, which modeled a document as merely "a file on the disk."</p>
<p>

Apple continued to talk about Pink as if it were to be the future Mac OS, but by 1993 or so it was clear they were no longer serious.</p>

As development dragged on, Apple eventually entered the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/98931.xml">
AIM alliance</link> with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../259/18622259.xml">
IBM</link> and <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../319/20319.xml">
Motorola</link></company>
. IBM had extensive experience in object-oriented programming, notably their well-respected <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../950/762950.xml">
VisualAge</link> <programming_language wordnetid="106898352" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../319/28319.xml">
Smalltalk</link></programming_language>
 programming system. They also had experience in microkernel design as a side-effect of their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../028/21028.xml">
Mach</link> based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/1044497.xml">
Workplace OS</link> efforts.</p>
<p>

Pink was then spun off from Apple as a joint project known as Taligent. The original Apple team was expanded with the addition of a very small number of IBM engineers, as well as a new CEO from IBM, Joe Guglielmi (apparently to the distaste of many of the Apple people).</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

"In 1992, the earth shook: IBM and Apple clasped hands and pronounced themselves allies. From this union sprang Taligent, a small Cupertino, California, company that's now developing nothing less than a universal operating system."
</indent>
:-MacWorld, 1994</p>
<p>

During its first year, IBM persuaded Taligent to replace its internally developed object-oriented microkernel, called Opus, with the microkernel that IBM was using as the base for IBM's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../497/1044497.xml">
Workplace OS</link>. The change in underlying technology had both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, Pink would become a personality on top of the IBM Workplace OS. This would create easy migration paths between <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/22409.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/22nd_century.xml">
AIX</link></O>
, Mac OS, and Pink by allowing any combination of operating system personalities to run simultaneously on a single computer. On the negative side, this created issues over how to integrate Taligent's object-oriented device-driver model with Workplace OS's procedural device-driver model.</p>

Development</st>
<p>

Taligent spent much of its first two years developing their operating system (sometimes referred to as TalOS) and simultaneously trying to find a market for it. They started a large project surveying potential customers, only to find little interest in a new OS. It is a point of controversy whether the lack of interest was real or the survey fell prey to question-framing problems and political issues with investors. If asked the question "Do you want a new OS?", there were few who would say yes. The survey did, however, show there was sufficient support for the benefits TalOS would bring.</p>
<p>

Influenced by the results of the survey effort, Taligent changed its focus from creating an object-oriented operating system, to creating an object-oriented programming environment that would run on any modern operating system. It was thought this approach would preserve much of the benefit of the higher levels of the system while freeing Taligent from the OS wars.  Because of the portability and modularity provided by the C++/object-oriented approach, this change in direction, while not trivial, was relatively easy to implement. The result was TalAE (Taligent Application Environment), later known as <b>CommonPoint</b>. TalAE consisted of more than a hundred object-oriented frameworks and nearly two thousand classes and was heavily pattern-oriented. It ran on top of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../ury/22nd_century.xml">
AIX</link>, <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../704/36704.xml">
HP-UX</link></O>
, <O wordnetid="106832680" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/22409.xml">

, <family wordnetid="108078020" confidence="0.8">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../438/33438.xml">
Windows NT</link></family>
, and a new Apple OS kernel called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/1983573.xml">
NuKernel</link>.  This made TalAE appear comparable to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../114/53114.xml">
OpenStep</link>.  </p>
<p>

At this time (in 1994), Taligent marketing types also began mentioning the possibility of TalDE (Taligent Development Environment) intended to be just as multiplatform as TalAE.  Also at this time, IBM marketing types floated the idea of putting a TalOS "personality module" into IBM WPOS (Workplace OS) &ndash; a Mach kernel-based OS for the PowerPC intended as a successor to OS/2.</p>
<p>

The combination of C++ and IBM and Apple's names on the project suggested that it might prove to be more successful than OpenStep. Early in 1994, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../973/13973.xml">
Hewlett-Packard</link> became a Taligent partner as well, which was surprising given that HP decided in the same year to produce OpenStep on their platforms. Several existing OpenStep "end customers" stated they would move to Taligent as soon as it was ready. The first versions of CommonPoint shipped for AIX and OS/2 in mid-1995, but were met with a lukewarm response in terms of sales. </p>
<p>

By 1995, Apple still didn't have an OS capable of running CommonPoint, and while work continued on the fabled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../520/532520.xml">
Copland</link> (which was designed to run CommonPoint), it was fairly clear to all involved that Apple had lost all interest in Taligent. Financial concerns at HP also caused their interest to wane. In early 1995 Guglielmi left Taligent for Motorola, and founding board member Dick Guarino became the new CEO. Guarino, though also from IBM, started Taligent on a new course as an object technology supplier in an effort to remain an independent company.</p>

Death of the project</st>
<p>

In the fall of 1995 Guarino died of a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../969/60969.xml">
heart attack</link> one Sunday afternoon while <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../216/309216.xml">
jogging</link>, and that loss spelled the end of Taligent as a joint venture. There was a reduction in force at the end of 1995 when it was decided that Taligent would become a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM, focusing on developing technology and leaving the marketing to IBM.</p>
<p>

IBM used parts of CommonPoint to create the <b>Open Class</b> class libraries for VisualAge for C++. IBM spawned an open source project called <idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">
