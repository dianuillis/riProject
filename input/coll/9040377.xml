. The main ideas are to base management decisions on a "philosophical sense of purpose", to think long term, to have a process for solving problems, to add value to the organization by developing its people, and to recognize that continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref><p>

The 14 Principles</st>
<p>

The Toyota Way has been called "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their
work"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> The 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: 1) Long-Term Philosophy, 2) The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results, 3) Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People, and 4) Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning. The principles are set out and briefly described below: </p>

<ss1>
<st>
Section I &mdash; Long-Term Philosophy</st>

<ss2>
<st>
Principle 1</st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.''</it></entry>
</list>

People need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.</p>

<st>
Section II &mdash; The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results</st>

<ss2>
<st>
Principle 2</st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.''</it></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste (<idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

) through the process of continuous improvement &mdash; kaizen. The seven types of muda are:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Overproduction</entry>

Unnecessary transport</entry>

Principle 3</st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction.''</it></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

A method where a process signals its predecessor that more material is needed. The pull system produces only the required material after the subsequent operation signals a need for it. This process is necessary to reduce overproduction.</p>

Principle 4</st>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Level out the workload (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../080/10323080.xml">

<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.''</it></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Although Toyota has a bureaucratic system, the way that it is implemented allows for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system. It empowers the employee to aid in the growth and improvement of the company.</p>

<p>

Included in this principle is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../345/12631345.xml">
5S</link> Program - steps that are used to make all work spaces efficient and productive, help people share work stations, reduce time looking for needed tools and improve the work environment.</p>

<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.''</it></entry>

<p>

Technology is <b>pulled by</b> manufacturing, not <b>pushed to</b> manufacturing.</p>

<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.''</it></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Without constant attention, the principles will fade. The principles have to be engrained, it must be the way one thinks. Employees must be educated and trained: they have to maintain a learning organization.</p>

</ss2>

Principle 10</st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.''</it></entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Teams should consist of 4-5 people and numerous management tiers. Success is based on the team, not the individual. </p>

Principle 11</st>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.</it> </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Toyota treats suppliers much like they treat their employees, challenging them to do better and helping them to achieve it. Toyota provides cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier. </p>

<p>

Toyota managers are expected to "go-and-see" operations. Without experiencing the situation firsthand, managers will not have an understanding of how it can be improved. Furthermore, managers use Tadashi Yamashima's (President, Toyota Technical Center (TCC)) ten management principles as a guideline:</p>

Translating the principles</st>
<p>

There is a question of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../131/5660131.xml">
uptake</link> of the principles now that Toyota has production operations in many different countries around the world. As a <it>New York Times</it> article notes, while the corporate culture may have been easily disseminated by word of mouth when Toyota manufacturing was only in Japan, with worldwide production, many different <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../508/19159508.xml">
culture</link>s must be taken into account. Concepts such as “mutual ownership of problems,” or “<it><idea wordnetid="105833840" confidence="0.8">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../822/8442822.xml">

</idea>
,</it>” (solving problems at the source instead of behind desks), and the “<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../010/287010.xml">
kaizen</link> mind,</it>” (an unending sense of crisis behind the company’s constant drive to improve), may be unfamiliar to North Americans and people of other cultures. A recent increase in vehicle recalls may be due, in part, to "a failure by Toyota to spread its obsession for craftsmanship among its growing ranks of overseas factory workers and managers." Toyota is attempting to address these needs by establishing training institutes in the United States and in Thailand.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
