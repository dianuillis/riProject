<p>

Another quote from her : "I had a size four and a half foot, so I modeled the slippers in an artist's short smock."</p>
<p>

She lost her job on The Dinah Shore Show when, as she has said, "We were shooting all night, and into the next day, and time just got away from me, and I didn't realize that I was supposed to be on the set working as Dinah's double on her show, Chevy Theatre. I completely messed up my job, I was what they called a no show."</p>

As Fuller says of the period before her success, "He (Ed Wood) begged me to marry him. I loved him in a way, but I couldn't handle the transvestism. I'm a very normal person. It's hard for me to deviate! I wanted a man that was all man. After we broke up, he would stand outside my home in Burbank and cry. "Let me in, I love you!" What good would I have done if I had married him? We would have starved together. I bettered myself. I had to uplift myself."</p>

Fuller placed 2nd in a mother-daughter beauty contest in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../254/435254.xml">
