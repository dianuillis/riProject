Students perform their work either via computers which already they own, or which are supplied to them by the school. Work is performed online via secure <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../481/37481.xml">
intranet</link> connections.</p>
<p>

ECOT was founded in 2000 by William "Bill" Lager, under an agreement with the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.lucas.k12.oh.us/">
Lucas County Educational Service Center</weblink>; and it is managed by his company, Altair Learning Management (IQity).</p>
<p>

Under Ohio law, "community schools" are independent public schools that offer school choice to parents, students and teachers. They are accountable to the public by a contract with a sponsor, such as a school district, or the <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ode.state.oh.us/">
Ohio Department of Education</weblink> (ODE). In ECOT's case, the school is accountable to LCESC and its publicly-elected Board. Community schools cannot charge tuition and must follow all laws pertaining to health, public safety and civil rights.</p>
<p>

Students are required to take state-mandated proficiency/achievement tests, and other examinations prescribed by law. Students are required to pass the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/2524115.xml">
Ohio Graduation Test</link> to receive a diploma.</p>
<p>

Technically speaking, ECOT is <b>not</b> a "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../603/13603.xml">
home schooling</link>" program. It is a public community school, subject to all the laws and regulations thereof. (See the ODE website for more detailed information regarding home schooling in the state of Ohio.)</p>
<p>

Students are expected to attend classes online for 25 hours per week during the school year, comparable to the time which students in "brick-and-mortar" schools are also expected to attend. Attendance need not adhere to traditional time conventions however; Affording flexibility to students and families not typically available in traditional educational settings.</p>
<p>

While students must be residents of the state, their education need not take place in the state. Education, not temporary location, is the focus. Travel need not hamper learning. Students whom must be outside the state for various reasons may participate. Common reasons for location-independent learning include:</p>
