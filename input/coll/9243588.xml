In 2004 Saloma received the prestigious <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ico-optics.org/ico_apr05.html">
Galileo Galilei Award</weblink> from the <social_group wordnetid="107950920" confidence="0.8">

</social_group>
 in recognition of his significant contributions in the field of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/22483.xml">
optics</link> that were accomplished under comparatively unfavorable conditions. He is the first and only scientist from an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/106539.xml">
ASEAN</link> member country to have received the Galileo Award.  </p>
<p>

On July 7, 2008, he received the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../387/18277387.xml">
ASEAN Outstanding Scientist and Technologist Award</link> from the ASEAN Committee on Science and Technology during the 8th ASEAN Science and Technology Week in Manila, Philippines.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> Saloma was recognized for his contributions to photonics and signal processing that were accomplished with colleagues and students at the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Saloma led the development of a method to generate high-contrast images of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../709/27709.xml">
semiconductor</link> sites via one <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../535/23535.xml">

microscopy</link>. The project received a US patent (No. 7,235,988) on 26 June 2007. He has published more than 100 papers in leading <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/184904.xml">
photonics</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../938/2641938.xml">
applied physics</link> and multidisciplinary journals in the US and Europe. His efforts â€œresulted in the development of novel and cost-effective / <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../188/1172188.xml">
non-invasive</link> method techniques in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/22483.xml">

recovery</link>, retrieval and identifying microscopic defects in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../150/15150.xml">
integrated circuits</link> (IC). His technique enables the accurate identification of circuit defects by producing a high-contrast <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../069/157069.xml">
image map</link> that distinguishes the semiconductor, metal and dielectric sites from each other.</p>
<p>

His fields of interest include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../240/55240.xml">
confocal laser scanning microscopy</link>,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../689/166689.xml">

optical microscopy</link> techniques, Saloma is also interested in the development of efficient models for describing the dynamics of real-world systems that involve a large number of interacting agents. </p>
<p>

Saloma was inducted into the National Academy of Science and Technology, Philippines (NAST) in July 2005. The NAST is the highest recognition body of the Philippine government on science and technology. It also provides advise to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../126/271126.xml">
Philippine President</link> and the Cabinet on matters related to science and technology</p>
<p>

Saloma is a recipient of other awards and recognition including the NAST Outstanding Young Scientist (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../938/2641938.xml">
Applied Physics</link>) in 1992, the NAST-Third World Academy of Science (TWAS) Prize in Physics in 1997, and the <it>Gawad Chanselor para sa Natatanging Guro</it> (Outstanding Teacher) in 2006 and several <it>Gawad Chanselor para sa Pinakamahusay na Mananaliksik</it> (Best Researcher in S&amp;T)  from the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/192981.xml">
University of the Philippines Diliman</link>. He is one of only three faculty members who have been appointed to the highest rank of Scientist III by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/190490.xml">
University of the Philippines System</link> in 2006. He also received the 2007 Metrobank Foundation Outstanding Teacher Award on September 7, 2007. </p>
<p>

The Department of Science and Technology-Philippines included Saloma in its list of "50 Men and Women of Science" that was released in June 2008 as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the foundation of the Department.</p>
<p>

On 19 September 2008, Saloma received the Lingkod Bayan Award - the Presidential Award for Outstanding Public Service, from Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in a ceremony held at the Malacanang Palace. The award is the highest recognition given to a Philippine government employee for outstanding work performance. </p>
