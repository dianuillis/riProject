Organizations that claim accreditation or approval by ADLP and NAHE sometimes acknowledge in their promotional materials that these organizations are unrecognized, but suggest that it is not important for accrediting bodies to have government recognition. For example, the Lacrosse University website<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> states:</p>

<p>

ADLP is a private accrediting association not listed with any government agency or the U.S. Department of Education, and is not designed to meet the needs of students intending to utilize federal funds. Students are encouraged to determine, prior to enrollment, that their degree program or studies meet admission or transfer requirements of other educational institutions, if they seek to continue their education. The University makes no representations, promises or guarantees of acceptability of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../609/12504609.xml">
transfer credit</link> to any other public or private educational institution. The National Academy of Higher Education (NAHE) evaluates the educational credentials of clients who have studied in other countries or attained degrees through alternative methods or distance learning to determine if they meet equivalency standards of the United States. NAHE is an International Credential Evaluation Service, founded in 1974 to help graduates gain the recognition they need to pursue their career and educational goals.</p>

<p>

People who obtain "degrees" from diploma mills that make these types of statements are likely to find that the credentials they bought are not accepted by academic institutions, governments, or employers.</p>

<p>

There is a legitimate organization with the name "National Academy of Higher Education" in <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../235/23235.xml">
Pakistan</link></country>
 <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>. The organization in Pakistan was not intended to be an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../700/621700.xml">
educational accreditation</link> body and is not connected to the "National Academy of Higher Education" <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../051/3816051.xml">
accreditation mill</link>.</p>
<p>

Its purpose is solely as a resource for professional development of educators at existing educational institutions. According to the Higher Education Commission, "National Academy of Higher Education is a new initiative of Higher Education Commission for faculty development in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../423/14423.xml">
higher education</link> institutions. The objective is to enhance basic competencies in academic practice in higher education."</p>
