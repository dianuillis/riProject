The <b>Illinois Security Lab</b> is a research laboratory at the 
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/384695.xml">
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</link> established in 2004 to support research and education in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/7398.xml">
computer</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../687/592687.xml">
network security</link>.  The lab is part of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../695/384695.xml">
UIUC</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../323/5323.xml">
Computer Science</link> Department and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../765/5228765.xml">
Information Trust Institute</link>.  Its research projects concern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../136/3698136.xml">
critical infrastructure protection</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../925/261925.xml">

 Secure Control Systems </st>
<p>

Networked <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../473/275473.xml">
control systems</link> such as the electric <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../824/38824.xml">
power grid</link> use computers for tasks like protecting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../189/1094189.xml">
substation</link>s against overloads (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../590/26590.xml">
protective relays</link>) and metering facilities (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../745/3895745.xml">
advanced meters</link>).  The lab developed the <it>attested meter</it>, a technology for security and privacy of advanced meters, and is working on security for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/2893444.xml">
building automation</link> systems and substation automation.</p>

</ss1>

 Assisted Living Security </st>
<p>

Advances in networking, distributed computing, and medical devices are combining with changes in the way health care is financed and the growing number of elderly people to produce strong prospects for the widespread use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../356/925356.xml">
assisted living</link>, a health care approach which can benefit from transferring medical information collected in homes or dedicated facilities to clinicians over data networks.  The lab explores security engineering of such systems through prototypes, field trials, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/161883.xml">
formal methods</link> based on an architecture that uses a partially-trusted <it>Assisted Living Service Provider (ALSP)</it> as a third party intermediary between assisted persons and clinicians.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Adaptive Messaging Policy (AMPol) </st>
<p>

Scalable distributed systems demand an ability to express and adapt to diverse policies of numerous distinct administrative domains.  The lab introduced technologies for messaging systems with adaptive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../539/2842539.xml">
security policies</link> based on <it>WSEmail</it>, where Internet messaging is implemented as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../483/93483.xml">
web service</link>, and <it>Attribute-Based Messaging (ABM)</it>, where addressing is based on attributes of recipients.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Contessa Network Security </st>
<p>

Although there has been significant progress on the formal analysis of security for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/127859.xml">
integrity</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/353859.xml">
confidentiality</link>, there has been relatively less progress on treating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../776/39776.xml">
denial-of-service attack</link>.  The lab is exploring techniques for doing this based on the <it>shared channel model</it>, which envisions bandwidth as a limiting factor in attacks and focuses on host-based counter-measures such as <it>selective verification</it>, which exploits adversary bandwidth limitations to favor valid parties.  It is also developing new <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/161883.xml">
formal methods</link> for reasoning about dynamic configuration of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../130/147130.xml">
VPN</link>s.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
 Formal Privacy </st>
<p>

Many new information technologies have a profound impact on privacy.  Threats from these have provoked legislation and calls for deeper regulation.  The lab develops ways to treat privacy rules more formally, including better ways to reason using <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/161883.xml">
formal methods</link> about conformance and the implications of regulations, and about how to quantify and classify privacy attitudes to control the risks of new technologies.  Recent work showed how to formally encode <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../064/384064.xml">
HIPAA</link> consent regulations using <it>privacy APIs</it> so they can be analyzed with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../157/321157.xml">
model checking</link>.</p>
