The <b>informal organization</b> is the interlocking <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../444/634444.xml">
social structure</link> that governs how people work together in practice. It is the aggregate of behaviors, interactions, norms, personal and professional connections through which work gets done and relationships are built among people who share a common <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../070/105070.xml">
organization</link>al affiliation or cluster of affiliations. It consists of a dynamic set of personal relationships, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../726/325726.xml">
social network</link>s, communities of common interest, and emotional sources of motivation.  The informal organization evolves organically and spontaneously in response to changes in the work environment, the flux of people through its porous boundaries, and the complex <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../330/29330.xml">
social dynamics</link> of its members.<p>

Tended effectively, the informal organization complements the more explicit structures, plans, and processes of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/1168398.xml">
formal organization</link>: it can accelerate and enhance responses to unanticipated events, foster innovation, enable people to solve problems that require collaboration across boundaries, and create footpaths showing where the formal organization may someday need to pave a way. </p>

Historically, some have regarded the informal organization as the byproduct of insufficient formal organization—arguing, for example, that “it can hardly be questioned that the ideal situation in the business organization would be one where no informal organization existed.” <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> However, the contemporary approach—one suggested as early as 1925 by <social_worker wordnetid="110620027" confidence="0.9173553029164789">
<writer wordnetid="110794014" confidence="0.9173553029164789">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../552/1846552.xml">
Mary Parker Follett</link></writer>
</social_worker>
, the pioneer of community centers and author of influential works on management philosophy—is to integrate the informal organization and the formal organization, recognizing the strengths and limitations of each. Integration, as Follett defined it, means breaking down apparent sources of conflict into their basic elements and then building new solutions that neither allow domination nor require compromise.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>  In other words, integrating the informal organization with the formal organization replaces competition with coherence. </p>
<p>

At a societal level, the importance of the relationship between formal and informal structures can be seen in the relationship between <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../443/209443.xml">
civil society</link> and state authority. The power of integrating the formal organization and the informal organization can also be seen in many successful businesses.</p>

<b>Learning organization.</b> Following a four-year study of the <link>
Toyota </link>Production System, Steven J. Spear and H. Kent Bowen concluded in Harvard Business Review that the legendary flexibility of Toyota’s operations is due to the way the scientific method is ingrained in its workers – not through formal training or manuals (the production system has never been written down) but through unwritten principles that govern how workers work, interact, construct, and learn.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></entry>

 credits its “Lunatic Fringe”—“an informal and amorphous group of TI engineers (and their peers and contacts outside the company),” according to Fortune Magazine—for its recent successes. "There's this continuum between total chaos and total order," Gene Frantz, the hub of this informal network, explained to Fortune. “About 95% of the people in TI are total order, and I thank God for them every day, because they create the products that allow me to spend money. I'm down here in total chaos, that total chaos of innovation. As a company we recognize the difference between those two and encourage both to occur."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></entry>
