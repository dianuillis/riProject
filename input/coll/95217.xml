Characters</st>


<ss1>
<st>
Klaymen</st>

<p>

Klaymen is the protagonist of the story. The player leads him on his adventures through <it>The Neverhood</it>, solving puzzles and getting out of difficult situations.</p>
<p>

He is a curious, cheerful being and a cousin of Willie Trombone. Klaymen is the hero of the Neverhood, and of Planet Idznak. He saves the creator of the Neverhood, Hoborg, from his deep sleep and ruins evil Klogg's plan - or, depending on the player's final choice for the ending, takes over the throne.
</p>
</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Klogg</st>
<p>

Klogg is a creature created by Hoborg for companionship. During his first day(s) on the Neverhood, Klogg looks remarkably similar to Klaymen, although with only one button on his chest, and possibly different colours. Although originally just greedy, he spots Hoborg's crown and knows he must have it. After unsuccessfully trying to snatch it from Hoborg, he begins formulating "baaaaad things". He eventually succeeds in stealing Hoborg's crown; after placing it on his head, Klogg became horribly deformed due to the crown's magical properties, and soon, downright sinister. He will stop at nothing to keep the player from completing their quest. In the end, his plans fail after he accidentally shoots himself with a giant cannon, knocking him off the Neverhood (in the sequel game <event wordnetid="100029378" confidence="0.8">

, he is shown to have landed on the planet Idznak, created by Hoborg's younger brother Arven). In the alternate ending, however, he laughs in triumph as Klaymen takes the crown for himself, before being knocked to the ground by a now similarly deformed Klaymen.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Hoborg</st>
<p>

Hoborg is the creator and ruler of the Neverhood. He also gives life to Klaymen and the evil Klogg. The name Hoborg means "Big Heart" (referenced in the Hall of Records). He, with Willie Trombone and Big Robot Bil's help, went through a harsh journey and got the finest "klay" in the universe. This klay could last for ever, and was perfect to make the Neverhood. The first son he 'makes' is Klogg, but Klogg wants to be the ruler and takes Hoborg's crown. Without the crown, Hoborg went into a deep sleep, as if lifeless. Luckily, one life seed escapes Klogg's attention. Willie takes this seed, which grows into Klaymen, the hero who would save the Neverhood from Klogg's evil reign. Later, Klaymen gets the crown back and returns it to Hoborg's head. Hoborg is pleased and makes many more sons with the remaining life seeds.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Willie Trombone</st>
<p>

Willie Trombone is Klaymen's dim-witted cousin and informant throughout the game. Willie is afraid of Klogg and wants to help Klaymen. The Hall of Records chronicles Hoborg's first meeting with Willie, but also the fact that he was created by Ottoborg, a picture of whom can be found on the wall in Willie's room. This picture is captioned "Dad".</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Big Robot Bil</st>
<p>

Big Robot Bil is Willie's robot pal. He is humongous, metal, very creaky, and just wants to hold his teddy bear. He was one of the robots that Ottoborg created. There were three of them, Appie, Togor and Bil. Bil was good at building. When Ottoborg's world broke apart, Bil met Willie Trombone. Then they met Hoborg, and helped him to find the finest klay in the universe. In gratitude, Hoborg gave Bil a blue teddy bear. Bil loved it. Willie and Bil stayed in Hoborg's world called The Neverhood, after Hoborg finished it. But Klogg took over Neverhood and he trapped Bil in a sort of prison. He also turned Bil bad, by pushing a lever from 'good' to 'bad' inside Bil's body. Soon Klaymen came to rescue. Bil's good nature was restored and Bil got his Teddy back. But Klogg was watching, he sent the Clockwork Beast to stop Klaymen. Bil defeated the beast with Klaymen's help. But Teddy was broken by the beast with its Bear Retrieval Units. Klogg wasn't satisfied yet, he fired the cannon and blew a hole on Bil's body, soon he fell out of the Neverhood along with Willie. After Klogg is defeated, Hoborg returns Willie and Bil back to the Neverhood. Willie appeared in Skullmonkeys, the second game of Neverhood, and Bil was left on The Neverhood to protect it until Klaymen got back.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Bear Retrieval Units</st>
<p>

The Bear Retrieval Units are sent out by the Clockwork Beast to retrieve Bil's green bear (a shot is shown from the Beast's point of view where he scans Teddy and text appears reading "Is object a bear? ... YES. Deploy Bear Retrieval Unit"). They are eyeless, beaked, skinny creatures similar to pterodactyls who wear red hats and drive in a roofless car with a harpoon gun. In the Neverhood theme, they are referred to as Crit Units 'A' and 'B'.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Clockwork Beast</st>
<p>

The Clockwork Beast is a mechanical beast created by Klogg to protect his castle. It's about the size of Big Robot Bil, and looks similar to the Bear Retrieval Units, except for its two cyborg eyes and other mechanized features. It was released once to try and stop Big Robot Bil from entering Klogg's castle. It knocked down Bil and ripped off his blue bear's head. Bil got angry and defeated the beast by knocking it off the Neverhood with his built-in springs.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Teddy Bear</st>
<p>

Big Robot Bil's teddy bear was a gift to him from Hoborg for helping Hoborg gather "klay" to make the Neverhood. It's big, green, and Bil's best pal. However, for unknown reasons the Clockwork Beast wanted to destroy it. When Bil and the Clockwork Beast fought the Bear Retrieval Units took it, delivered it to the Clockwork Beast, and the Clockwork Beast destroyed it. There is no evidence that it was repaired or that Bil got a new one.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Weasel</st>
<p>

A large greenish crustacean/insect creature that chased Klaymen early in the game, when he accidentally released it from a closed cave. Eventually, Weasel chased Klaymen into a house after trying to catch him. Klaymen then fed Weasel a Klaymen-looking doll (a decoy) made of dynamite, and blew him up. A second Weasel appears later on in the game shown attacking Willie. This Weasel is purple and smaller than the previous one, and it is splattered when Big Robot Bil punches it through Willie's bedroom window. It could be noted that the first Weasel is male and the second is female, or vice versa.</p>

</ss1>

<st>
The Neverhood Hall of Records</st>
<p>

The Neverhood Hall of Records is a 38-screen long wall found in the game, filled with <it>The Neverhood Chronicles</it>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../390/3390.xml">
Bible</link>-esque lore of the universe in which the Neverhood exists. The Hall of Records was made up of a self-carving, history recording klay wall. This wall once belonged to Quater, the creation of Father. Quater, as Father commanded, recorded history with these walls. There were seven of these klay walls, given to Quater's seven sons, Ogdilla, Bertbert, Numeron, Ottoborg, Homen, Hoborg, and Arven. One of them could be found in the Neverhood, in the Hall of Records. The wall stopped recording when Klogg took the throne of Hoborg.</p>
<p>

In an unofficial Russian translation of the game, the writings were replaced with humorous stories.</p>
<p>

<it>The Neverhood Chronicles</it> (written by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/95230.xml">
Douglas TenNapel</link> and <link>
Mark Lorenzen</link>) tells the story of the creation of the universe in which the Neverhood exists. It contains eight separate books and occupies 38 screens within the game. While reading it isn't necessary to complete the game, traversing the 38 screens it occupies is.</p>
<p>

Several of the characters and stories found within <it>The Neverhood Chronicles</it> possess striking similarities to those found in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../390/3390.xml">
Bible</link>. In addition, several large portions of <it>The Neverhood Chronicles</it> are written in Biblical verse fashion, with close examinations of detailed lineage throughout.</p>

Doug TenNapel wrote in March 2007 to his official forum that he is in talks with a producer about making a movie based on the Neverhood world.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> <studio wordnetid="104344246" confidence="0.8">

 port of the PC game dubbed <it>Klaymen Klaymen</it> was made and released to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/15573.xml">
Japan</link>ese audiences only. The Japanese release of <it>Skullmonkeys</it>, in turn, received the appropriate name <it>Klaymen Klaymen 2</it>. Following the sequel, another Japanese PlayStation game set in the Neverhood universe called <it>Klaymen Gun-Hockey</it> was made. A Japan-only sports action game, it was based on the characters of the Neverhood, but was not developed by the designers of the original games; it also did not feature the previous releases' distinctive Claymation design techniques. The game is a variation on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../138/418138.xml">
air hockey</link>, only played with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../650/11650.xml">
gun</link>s instead of mallets. </p>
<p>

Klaymen is featured as a secret fighter for the PlayStation game <it><link>
Boombots</link></it>, developed by The Neverhood, Inc.</p>
