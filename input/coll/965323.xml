An <b>antimicrobial</b> is a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../377/20377.xml">
microbe</link>s such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../799/9028799.xml">
bacteria</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../965/19178965.xml">
fungi</link>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/19167679.xml">
viruses</link>. Antimicrobial drugs either kill microbes (microbicidal) or prevent the growth of microbes (microbistatic).<p>

The history of antimicrobials begins with the observations of <link>
Pasteur</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../250/1427250.xml">
Joubert</link>, who discovered that one type of bacteria could prevent the growth of another. They did not know at that time that the reason one bacteria failed to grow was that the other bacteria was producing an antibiotic. Technically, antibiotics are only those substances that are produced by one microorganism that kill, or prevent the growth, of another microorganism. Of course, in today's common usage, the term antibiotic is used to refer to almost any drug that cures a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../166/11524166.xml">
bacterial infection</link>. Antimicrobials include not just antibiotics, but synthetically formed compounds as well.</p>
<p>

The discovery of antimicrobials like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../312/23312.xml">
penicillin</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../649/30649.xml">
tetracycline</link> paved the way for better health for millions around the world. Before 1941, the year penicillin was discovered, no true cure for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../737/18006737.xml">
gonorrhea</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../398/92398.xml">
strep throat</link>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/52135.xml">
pneumonia</link> existed. Patients with infected wounds often had to have a wounded limb removed, or face death from infection. Now, most of these infections can be easily cured with a short course of antimicrobials.</p>
<p>

However, the future effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy is somewhat in doubt. Microorganisms, especially bacteria, are becoming resistant to more and more antimicrobial agents. Bacteria found in hospitals appear to be especially resilient, and are causing increasing difficulty for the sickest patients–those in the hospital. Currently, bacterial resistance is combated by the discovery of new drugs. However, microorganisms are becoming resistant more quickly than new drugs are being found, Thus, future research in antimicrobial therapy may focus on finding how to overcome resistance to antimicrobials, or how to treat infections with alternative means.</p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../805/1805.xml">
Antibiotics</link> are generally used to treat bacterial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/37220.xml">
infections</link>.  The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../567/170567.xml">
toxicity</link> to humans and other animals from antibiotics is generally considered to be low.  However, prolonged use of certain antibiotics can decrease the number of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../637/3135637.xml">
gut flora</link>, which can have a negative impact on health.  Some recommend that during or after prolonged antibiotic use, that one should consume <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../740/731740.xml">
probiotics</link> and eat reasonably to replace destroyed gut flora.</p>
<p>

The term antibiotic originally described only those formulations derived from living organisms but is now applied also to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../029/85029.xml">
synthetic</link> antimicrobials, such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../809/6200809.xml">
sulfonamide</link>s.</p>
<p>

The discovery, development, and clinical use of antibiotics during the 20th century has substantially decreased mortality from bacterial infections. The antibiotic era began with the pneumatic application of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/21530.xml">
nitroglycerine</link> drugs, followed by a “golden” period of discovery from approximately 1945 to 1970, when a number of structurally diverse, highly effective agents were discovered and developed. However, since 1980 the introduction of new antimicrobial agents for clinical use has declined. Paralleled to this there has been an alarming increase in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../914/1914.xml">
bacterial resistance</link> to existing agents.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>
<p>

Antibiotics are among the most commonly used drugs. For example, 30%
or more hospitalized patients are treated with one or more courses of
antibiotic therapy. However, antibiotics
are also among the drugs commonly misused by physicians, e.g. usage of
antibiotic agents in viral <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../087/3454087.xml">
respiratory tract infection</link>. The
inevitable consequence of widespread and injudicious use of
antibiotics has been the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens,
resulting in the emergence of a serious <b>threat to global public health</b>.
The resistance problem demands that a renewed effort be made
to seek antibacterial agents effective against pathogenic bacteria
resistant to current antibiotics. One of the possible strategies
towards this objective is the rational localization of bioactive

Antiviral drug</link></it>
</indent>

Antiviral drugs   are a class of medication used specifically for treating <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../679/19167679.xml">
viral</link> infections. Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses. They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../121/180121.xml">
treat</link> infections.  They should be distinguished from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../358/1550358.xml">
viricide</link>s, which actively deactivate virus particles outside the body.</p>
<p>

Most of the antivirals now available are designed to help deal with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../170/14170.xml">
HIV</link>; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../754/4235754.xml">
herpes viruses</link>, best known for causing <link>
cold sore</link>s and genital herpes, but actually causing a wide range of diseases; the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../628/15925628.xml">
hepatitis B</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/71491.xml">
C</link> viruses, which can cause liver cancer; and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/440479.xml">
influenza A</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../397/3833397.xml">
B</link> viruses. Researchers are now working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens. </p>
<p>

Antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the virus ether before it enters the cell, stopping it from reproducing, or in some cases preventing it from exiting the cell. However, like antibiotics, viruses may evolve to resist the antiviral drug.</p>

Antifungals work by exploiting differences between mammalian and fungal cells to kill off the fungal organism without dangerous effects on the host. Unlike bacteria, both fungi and humans are <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../475/19172475.xml">
eukaryote</link>s. Thus fungal and human <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../230/4230.xml">
cell</link>s are similar at the molecular level. This means it is more difficult to find a target for an antifungal drug to attack that does not also exist in the infected organism. Consequently, there are often <work wordnetid="100575741" confidence="0.8">

Traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious disease. Many of these plants have been investigated scientifically for antimicrobial activity and a large number of plant products have been shown to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. A number of these agents appear to have structures and modes of action that are distinct from those of the antibiotics in current use, suggesting that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/10479653.xml">
cross-resistance</link> with agents already in use may be minimal. So, it is worthwhile to study plants and plant products for activity against resistant bacteria.</p>
