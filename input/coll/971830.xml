The <b>Vera Page Case</b> was an unsolved <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../171/20171.xml">
murder</link> case from the early 1930s. Vera Page was born in 1921 in <site wordnetid="108651247" confidence="0.9508927676800064">

. He discovered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../987/5987.xml">
coal</link>-dust and candle wax on the girl's body, as well as a piece of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../365/1365.xml">
ammonia</link>-stained finger bandage . Over a thousand people were questioned about the Vera Page case, and <b>Percy Orlando Rush</b> was the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../966/344966.xml">
prime suspect</link>. Rush was a forty year-old married man, who had often been seen lurking about the district on evenings. Furthermore, he had recently had a bandage applied to his finger and he worked with ammonia in a nearby laundry. Unremarked upon at the inquest was the fact that he had been previously found guilty of exposing himself to girls. He was never officially charged with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../171/20171.xml">
murder</link>, but is highly likely he was the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../171/20171.xml">
murderer</link>. However, no one saw him with Vera on the day of her death, though his movements were never verified. He died in 1961.<p>

The above information can be verified by The Kensington News and Kensington Post of 1931-1932, and by the Metropolitan police file on the case held at the National Archives.</p>
