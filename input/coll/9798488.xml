The <b>regional cuisines of medieval Europe</b> were the results of differences in climate, political administration and religious customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned.

lard</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/46183.xml">
butter</link> for cooking and a diet that was perceived as especially fatty gained Germans a reputation as being the "fat Germans". The fasting regulations of the Catholic church posed particular problems to the German population. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../479/22479.xml">

butter</link> and, above all, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/18621997.xml">
lard</link>. The price of fish was generally higher, and while it was unaffordable to most people for most of the time, the need to use fish for fasting days could mean considerable increases in expenses for the wealthier households. Mustard was used in other parts of Europe long before the Middle Ages, but seemed to be especially common in Germany.

With the invaders came a new and less provincial gentry, and new eating habits, especially for the nobility. While traditional British cooking today is not regarded with high esteem internationally, the Medieval Anglo-Norman cooks were considerably more refined and more cosmopolitan. It has previously been believed that the Anglo-Norman cuisine was mostly similar to that of France, but recent study has shown that many recipes had unique English traits.

In the far north of Europe, made cultivation of cereals even more difficult, and the wheat so popular in the south, was a luxury, the aristocrat of grains and could cost at least twice as much as the most common grains, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../428/19541428.xml">
barley</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../574/46574.xml">
rye</link>. Barley was the most widely grown, but a great percentage of the harvest went into the extensive <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../363/3363.xml">
beer</link> production, while rye was the principal bread grain. Like in the rest of Europe, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/46573.xml">
oats</link> was considered only fit as animal fodder and was only eaten when no other choice was available, and then usually as porridge or gruel. Though grains were in the highest regard among medieval Scandinavians and were among the most frequently mentioned foods, other vegetable foods were an indispensable part of the diet: peas, turnips, beans, carrots, onions, leeks and various greens and herbs all provided essential nutrients and vitamins. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../106/571106.xml">
Kale</link>, a form of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../115/55115.xml">
cabbage</link>, was especially important in Denmark and Sweden and was a valuable source of fresh food in the winter months, since it kept well and could be harvested (and even tasted better) after the first frost had set in.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

Fish was of great importance to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../890/49890.xml">
herring</link> fishing in the <body_of_water wordnetid="109225146" confidence="0.8">

 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../268/55268.xml">
Oresund</link>. The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers. The amount of fish caught was more than enough to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish. Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at <link>

, which was in the Middle Ages part of Denmark. From this market alone, merchant vessels of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../105/14105.xml">
Hanseatic League</link>, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels of salted herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref> Of equal, or even greater importance was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../515/41515.xml">
cod</link>, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../898/1254898.xml">

 left huge field areas untended and well-suited for grazing. The majority of meat produced was consumed by the local population, but an export market for high-grade beef slowly built up after the 1360s, and had by the 1600s reached well over 100 000 animals per year. All this cattle meant not just meat, but also great quantities of dairy products, which consisted mostly of soured milk drinks, various cheeses and, also a major export product, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/46183.xml">

, but also had its own specialties. Typical of the Northern French kitchen were the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../906/1954906.xml">
potage</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/502185.xml">
broth</link>s, and French chefs excelled in the preparation of meat, fish, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../993/52993.xml">
roast</link>s, and the sauces that were considered appropriate to each dish. The use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../546/334546.xml">
dough</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../062/67062.xml">
pastry</link>, which was fairly popular in Britain at the time, was almost completely absent from recipe collections with the exception of a few <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../796/90796.xml">

. A common Northern French habit was to name dishes after famous and often exotic places and people.</p>
<p>

A specialty among finer French chefs was the preparation of so-called parti-colored dishes. These mimicked the late medieval fashion of wearing clothing with two colors contrasting one another on either side of the garment, a fashion that survived in the costumes of court <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../135/78135.xml">
jester</link>s. The common Western European "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/37733.xml">

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../883/14883.xml">

Meseta</link>, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and cut off from the rest of Europe by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../707/24707.xml">
Pyrenees</link>. This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines. Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../006/19006.xml">

, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine. After the collapse of Roman rule, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../530/32530.xml">

verjuice</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../931/227931.xml">

The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which is still forms the basis for many modern European meals; soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets. It also believed that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/3796401.xml">

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../282/5282.xml">

 around 1324. A majority of its recipes call for bitter oranges, rose water and cider to achieve the popular tangy flavor of late medieval cuisine. It contains many fish recipes, but surprisingly enough, no mention of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../037/55037.xml">
shellfish</link>, which must have been one of the major food sources in the Catalan coastal regions. The highly influential <it>Libre del Coch</it> was published in a printed edition in 1520, but is assumed to have been written no later than 1490. The typical medieval <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../733/37733.xml">
white dish</link> (<it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../409/4195409.xml">

While poorly represented in cookbooks, the most common food for the general population, other than the regular staples of bread, wine, garlic, onion and olive oil, included eggs, lamb, beef, kid and bacon.</p>

, was one of the few regions in medieval Europe where the distinction between nobility and prosperous commoners were more or less irrelevant, the result of a significant, rich and self-conscious <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../534/251534.xml">
middle class</link>. This meant that the level of culinary refinement and diversity was especially great when compared to the rest of the continent. Italian cuisine was, and still is, better described as a multitude of highly varied regional cuisines, each with long traditions and their own specialties. Italian dishes can therefore be considered either traditional or imported. Being the hub of a vast trade network meant that there was greater access to foreign luxuries to influence the local cooking. Still, there was a great deal of conservatism and in general far more of local Italian foodstuffs were exported to the <grouping wordnetid="101012360" confidence="0.8">

Many Italian staples and internationally recognized favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../871/23871.xml">

Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the cooking fat of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref></p>

The cuisine of southern France, corresponding roughly to the extent of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../357/1149357.xml">
Occitania</link>, had far more in common with Italian and <region wordnetid="108630039" confidence="0.8">

 cooking than with northern French cuisine. Ingredients that distinguished southern cooking included <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../712/27712.xml">
sugar</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../431/1208431.xml">
walnut oil</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../146/57146.xml">
chickpeas</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../549/74549.xml">
pomegranate</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../437/38437.xml">
lemon</link>s, all of which were grown locally. While pomegranate seeds were occasionally used to decorate dishes in France and England, flavoring dishes with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/3781084.xml">
pomegranate juice</link> was a practice unique to the Occitan areas. </p>
<p>

The use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../183/46183.xml">
butter</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../997/18621997.xml">
lard</link> was rare, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../868/1117868.xml">
salted meat</link> for frying was common, and the preferred methods of cooking tended to be dry roasting, frying, or baking. For the latter, a <it>trapa</it>, a portable oven that was filled with food and buried in hot ashes, was often used. </p>
<p>

Dishes still common today, like <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../401/3796401.xml">
escabeche</link></it>, a vinegar-based dish, and <it>aillade</it> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../379/60379.xml">
aioli</link>), a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../469/50469.xml">
garlic</link> sauce (still made in Toulouse with walnut oil), were well-established in the Late Middle Ages. Evidence of influence from Muslim Spain can be found in recipes for <it>matafeam</it>, a Christian version of the originally Hispano-Jewish <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../809/28809.xml">
Shabbat</link> stew <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../804/1389804.xml">
adafina</link></it>, but with pork rather than lamb.  And, <it>Raymonia</it> (Occitan; Ital: <it>Romania</it>) is based on the Arabic <it>Rummaniya</it>, a chicken <link>
bruet</link> with pomegranate juice, ground almonds, and sugar. </p>
<p>

Only one recipe collection is positively identified as being from southern France.  The <it>Modus viaticorum preparandorum et salsarum</it> is a collection of 51 recipes. It was written ca. 1380-90 in <language wordnetid="106282651" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../730/17730.xml">
Latin</link></language>
 with occasional words in <link>
Occitan</link>.  The <it>Modus</it> contains a <it>Salsa de cerpol</it> (Wild thyme sauce) and a <it>Cofiment anguille</it> (Confit of eel), which appear nowhere else but in Occitania. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>

A cookery book from northern Europe may have originated in Provence. Known from its <it>incipit</it> as <it>Libellus de arte coquinaria</it>, it is the Codex K version of the Harpestraeng Cookbook, which is part of a collection of medical papers written by, or belonging to, Dr. Henrik Harpestraeng.  It is currently housed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen (Ny samling Nr. 66, 8 vo.). Food historian Dr. Rudolf Grewe proposed a NW Mediterranean origin for this book based on the recipes and their ingredients, such as saffron.  Since Harpestraeng studied medicine in Provence, probably at Montpellier, he may have obtained the book during that time. Harpestraeng may have brought the book to Denmark, where he was the physician to King Valdemar II. Codex K is believed to have been copied into Danish from an earlier Low German original, or copy. This would have happened before 1244, the year Harpestraeng died. If so, <it>Libellus de arte coquinaria</it> is the earliest Western European cookery book, since <text wordnetid="106387980" confidence="0.8">

Roman</link> times lived on in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../981/16972981.xml">
Byzantine</link> empire. Inherited from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../486/12486.xml">

olive</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../478/22478.xml">
olive oil</link>, wheat bread, and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or prepared with <it>garÃ³s</it>, the Greek term for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../320/312320.xml">
