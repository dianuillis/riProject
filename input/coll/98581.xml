 (Alkindus), wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which he named ‘<it>Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations</it>’. It contained more than hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described one hundred and seven methods and recipes for perfume-making, and even the perfume making equipment, like the alembic, still bears its Arabic name<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>. </p>

 quickly became the European center of perfume and cosmetic manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France. During the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../532/25532.xml">

Concentration</st>
<p>

Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/10048_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
ethanol</link> or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The concentration by percent/volume of perfume oil is as follows:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Perfume extract (Extrait): 15-40% (IFRA: typical 20%) aromatic compounds </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Eau de Parfum (EdP), Parfum de Toilette (PdT): 10-20% (typical ~15%) aromatic compounds. Sometimes listed as "eau de perfume".</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Eau de Toilette (EdT): 5-15% (typical ~10%) aromatic compounds </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/83543.xml">
Eau de Cologne</link> (EdC): Chypre citrus type perfumes with 3-8% (typical ~5%) aromatic compounds </entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Splash and After shave: 1-3% aromatic compounds </entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

Perfume oil is necessarily diluted with a solvent because undiluted oils (natural or synthetic) contain high concentrations of chemical components (natural or otherwise) that will likely result in allergic reactions and possibly injury when applied directly to skin or clothing. As well, the scents in pure perfume oils are far too concentrated to smell pleasant. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling liquid oils such as fractionated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../915/239915.xml">
coconut oil</link>, or liquid <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/58256.xml">
wax</link>es such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../172/2770172.xml">
jojoba oil</link>.</p>
<p>

The intensity and longevity of a perfume bases on the concentration, intensity and longevity of the used aromatic compounds (natural essential oils / perfume oils): As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent created. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in <it>Eau de Parfum</it> (EdP) dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in <it>Eau de Toilette</it> (EdT) from within the same range, the actual amounts can vary between perfume houses. An EdT from one house may be stronger than an EdP from another.</p>
<p>

Men's fragrances are rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. As well, women's fragrances are rarely sold in EdC concentrations. Although this gender specific naming trend is common for assigning fragrance concentrations, it does not directly have anything to do with whether a fragrance was intended for men or women.</p>
<p>

Furthermore, some fragrances with the same <it>product name</it> but having a different <it>concentration name</it> may not only differ in their dilutions, but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its EdP, the EdT oil may be "tweaked" to contain slightly more top notes or fewer base notes. In some cases, words such as "<it>extrême</it>", "<it>intense</it>" or "<it>concentrée</it>", that might indicate aromatic concentration are sometimes completely different fragrances that relates only because of a similar perfume <it>accord</it>. An example of this would be Chanel‘s <it>Pour Monsieur</it> and <it>Pour Monsieur Concentrée</it>.</p>
<p>

Since 1994 in Germany are produced more than 100 different perfumes basing on natural sources with the feature to be skin protecting: They have ~1% aromatic compounds and are useful as scent with hoemostatic (homeopathic) effects; and ad Jojoba as perfumes, as (herpes-protecting) lip-gloss and as skin-care.</p>

The precise formulae of commercial perfumes are kept <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../960/29960.xml">
secret</link>.  Even if they were widely published, they would be dominated by such complex ingredients and odorants that they would be of little use in providing a useful guide to the general consumer in description of the <it>experience</it> of a scent. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of perfume can become extremely skillful at identifying components and origins of scents in the same manner as wine experts <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.</p>
<p>

The most practical way to start describing a perfume is according to the elements of the <it>fragrance notes</it> of the scent or the <it>family</it> it belongs to, all of which affect the overall impression of a perfume from first application to the last lingering hint of scent<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

 Note (perfumery)</link></it>
</indent>
Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of 'notes', making the harmonious scent accord. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.  
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Top notes</b>: The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Also called the head notes.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Middle notes</b>: The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to when the top notes dissipate. The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. They are also called the "heart notes".</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Base notes</b>: The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes, as well the scents of the base notes will be altered by the type of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufactures of perfumes usually publish perfume notes and typically they present it as fragrance pyramid, with the components listed in imaginative and abstract terms.</p>

Olfactive families</st>
<p>

Grouping perfumes, like any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../463/30463.xml">
taxonomy</link>, can never be a completely objective or final process. Many fragrances contain aspects of different families. Even a perfume designated as "single flower", however subtle, will have undertones of other aromatics. "True" unitary scents can rarely be found in perfumes as it requires the perfume to exist only as a singular aromatic material.</p>
<p>

Classification by olfactive family is a starting point for a description of a perfume, but it cannot by itself denote the specific characteristic of that perfume.</p>

The traditional classification which emerged around 1900 comprised the following categories:

Fragrance Wheel perfume classification chart, ver. 1983
</caption>
</image>

The Fragrance wheel is a relatively new classification method that is widely used in retail and in the fragrance industry. The method was created in 1983 by Michael Edwards, a consultant in the perfume industry, who designed his own scheme of fragrance classification.The new scheme was created in order to simplify fragrance classification and naming scheme, as well as to show the relationships between each of the individual classes<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref>. </p>
<p>

The five standard families consist of <it>Floral</it>, <it>Oriental</it>, <it>Woody</it>,<it>Fougère</it>, and <it>Fresh</it>, with the former four families being more "classic" while the latter consisting of newer bright and clean smelling citrus and oceanic fragrances that have arrived due to improvements in fragrance technology. With the exception of the <it>Fougère</it> family, each of the families are in turn divided into sub-groups and arranged around a wheel.</p>

Plant sources</st>
<p>

Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually <link>
secondary metabolites</link> produced by plants as protection against <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../568/44568.xml">
herbivore</link>s, infections, as well as to attract <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../084/106084.xml">
pollinator</link>s. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../640/341640.xml">
coriander</link> have remarkably different odors from each other. <symbol wordnetid="106806469" confidence="0.8">

coumarin</link> are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../242/214242.xml">
terpenes</link>. Orchid scents (typically <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../143/28143.xml">
salicylates</link></it>) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.  </p>

Extraction (fragrance)</link></it>
</indent>
Before perfumes can be composed, the odorants used in various perfume compositions must first be obtained. Synthetic odorants are produced through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../984/1456984.xml">
organic synthesis</link> and purified. Odorants from natural sources require the use of various methods to extract the aromatics from the raw materials. The results of the extraction are either essential oils, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending on the amount of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../256/58256.xml">
wax</link>es in the extracted product. <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
<p>

All these techniques will, to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to the use of heat, harsh solvents, or through exposure to oxygen in the extraction process which will denature the aromatic compounds, which either change their odor character or renders them odorless.

Fragrant extracts</st>
<p>

Although fragrant extracts are known to the general public as the generic term "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../028/281028.xml">
essential oil</link>s", a more specific language is used in the fragrance industry to describe the source, purity, and technique used to obtain a particular fragrant extract.</p>
<p>

Of these extracts, only <it>absolutes</it>, <it>essential oils</it>, and <it>tinctures</it> are directly used to formulate perfumes.
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<b>Absolute</b>: Fragrant materials that are purified from a <it>pommade</it> or <it>concrete</it> by soaking them in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/10048_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
ethanol</link>. By using a slightly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../293/79293.xml">
hydrophilic</link> compound such as ethanol, most of the fragrant compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules. Absolutes are usually found in the form of an oily liquid.</entry>

<b>Concrete</b>: Fragrant materials that have been extracted from raw materials through <it>solvent extraction</it> using volatile <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/13257.xml">

Composing perfumes</st>
<p>

Perfume compositions are an important part of many industries ranging from the luxury goods sectors, food services industries, to manufacturers of various household chemicals. The purpose of using perfume or fragrance compositions in these industries is to affect customers through their <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../645/158645.xml">
sense of smell</link> and entice them into purchasing the perfume or perfumed product. As such there is significant interest in producing a perfume formulation that people will find aesthetically pleasing.</p>

The job of composing perfumes that will sell is left up to an expert on perfume composition or known in the fragrance industry as the <it>perfumer</it>. They are also sometimes referred to affectionately as a "<it>Nez</it>" (French for <it>nose</it>) due to their fine sense of smell and skill in smell composition.</p>
<p>

The composition of a perfume typically begins with a <it>brief</it> by the perfumer's employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../485/7485.xml">
corporation</link>s of various industries. The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and sell the formulation to the customer, often with modifications of the composition of the perfume.</p>
<p>

The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a <it>functional fragrance</it> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../002/18842002.xml">

Although there is no single "correct" technique for the formulation of a perfume, there are general guidelines as to how a perfume can be constructed from a concept. Although many ingredients do not contribute to the smell of a perfume, many perfumes include colorants and anti-oxidants to improve the marketability and shelf life of the perfume, respectively.  </p>

<ss2>
<st>
Basic framework</st>
<p>

Perfume oils usually contain tens to hundreds of ingredients and these are typically organized in a perfume for the specific role they will play. These ingredients can be roughly grouped into four groups:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Primary scents</it>: Can consist of one or a few main ingredients for a certain concept, such as "rose". Alternatively, multiple ingredients can be used together to create an "abstract" primary scent that does not bear a resemblance to a natural ingredient. For instance, jasmine and rose scents are commonly blends for abstract floral fragrances. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../491/7491.xml">
Cola</link> flavourant is a good example of an abstract primary scent.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Modifiers</it>: These ingredients alter the primary scent to give the perfume a certain desired character: for instance, fruit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../675/9675.xml">
ester</link>s may be included in a floral primary to create a fruity floral; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../729/4837729.xml">
calone</link> and citrus scents can be added to create a "fresher" floral. The cherry scent in cherry cola can be considered a modifier.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Blenders</it>: A large group of ingredients that smooth out the transitions of a perfume between different "layers" or bases. Common blending ingredients include <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../144/1380144.xml">
linalool</link> and <link>
hydroxycitronellal</link>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

<it>Fixatives</it>: Used to support the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins and wood scents, and amber bases are used as fixatives.</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The top, middle, and base notes of a fragrance may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients.</p>
<p>

The perfume's fragrance oils are then blended with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../de)/10048_(Z$I$P$_code).xml">
ethyl alcohol</link> and water, aged in tanks for a minimum of 14 days and filtered through processing equipment to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles. </p>

</ss2>
<ss2>
<st>
Fragrance bases</st>
<p>

Instead of building a perfume from "ground up", many modern perfumes and colognes are made using <it>fragrance bases</it> or simply <b>bases</b>. Each base is essentially modular perfume that is blended from essential oils and aromatic chemicals, and formulated with a simple concept such as "fresh cut grass" or "juicy sour apple". Many of <name wordnetid="106333653" confidence="0.8">

's <it>Aqua Allegoria</it> line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.</p>
<p>

The effort used in developing bases by fragrance companies or individual perfumers may equal that of a marketed perfume, since they are useful in that they are reusable. On top of its reusability, the benefit in using bases for construction are quite numerous:
<list>
<entry level="1" type="number">

Ingredients with "difficult" or "overpowering" scents that are tailored into a blended base may be more easily incorporated into a work of perfume</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

A base may be better scent approximations of a certain thing than the extract of the thing itself. For example, a base made to embody the scent for "fresh dewy rose" might be a better approximation for the scent concept of a rose after rain than plain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../644/2161644.xml">
rose oil</link>. Flowers whose scents cannot be extracted, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../897/710897.xml">
gardenia</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../141/76141.xml">
hyacinth</link>, are composed as bases from data derived from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../399/17599399.xml">
headspace technology</link>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="number">

A perfumer can quickly rough out a concept from a brief by cobbling together multiple bases, then present it for feedback. Smoothing out the "edges" of the perfume can be done after a positive response.</entry>

Reverse engineering</st>
<p>

Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../892/846892.xml">
GC/MS</link> can reveal the "general" formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume's ingredients, this is particularly due to presence of natural essential oils and other ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, "anyone armed with good GC/MS equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more or less precisely."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref></p>
<p>

Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using gas chromatograph (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent.</p>
<p>

Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of perfume market.</p>

Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions even when the participants could not actually smell the fragrances<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>. Many fragrance ingredients can cause allergic skin reactions<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> or nausea.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>
<p>

In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../313/55313.xml">
allergic</link> reactions of the skin. For instance, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../185/69185.xml">
acetophenone</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../134/1303134.xml">
ethyl acetate</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../597/1795597.xml">
acetone</link> while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../859/58859.xml">
allergen</link>s. Nevertheless this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this.</p>
<p>

Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref>,  However some studies, such as IFRA's research claim that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../220/1287220.xml">
opoponax</link> is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref>.

These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets.</p>

Species endangerment</st>
<p>

The demands for aromatic materials like sandalwood, agarwood, musk has led to the endangerment of these species as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting. </p>

Safety regulation</st>
<p>

The perfume industry in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and require that they be tested to the extent that they are <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../905/811905.xml">
Generally recognized as safe</link></it> (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, the mandatory listing of any of a number of chemicals thought to be hazardous has just begun. As well many old perfumes of like chypres and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../413/890413.xml">
fougeres</link> classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, are being reformulated because of these new regulations. </p>

Preserving perfume</st>

Fragrance compounds in perfumes will degrade or break down if improperly stored in the presence of:

 Extraneous organic materials</entry>
</list>

Proper preservation of perfumes involve keeping them away from sources of heat and storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, as long as it is well stored.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> However the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.</p>
<p>

Perfumes are best preserved when kept in light-tight <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../904/904.xml">
aluminium</link> bottles or in their original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated at a relatively low temperatures between 3-7 degrees Celsius. Although it is difficult to completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and "open" bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.</p>
