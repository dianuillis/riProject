 (HEP). The power plant provides more than one-quarter of Slovenia's and roughly a fifth of Croatia's power.</p>
<p>

The reason why the plant is co-owned by two countries was that these  then constituent republics of Yugoslavia planned to build two plants, one in each republic, according to the original 1970 agreement and its revised version from 1982, but that plan was abandoned by Slovenia due to a referendum held in 1987. From that point on, there arose an issue with nuclear waste storage, because the only existing waste storage site was in Slovenia. In 1997, ELES and NEK decided to increase the operational and decommissioning costs billed to both ELES and HEP, but the latter refused to pay. In 1998, the Government of Slovenia nationalized NEK, stopped supplying power from Krško to HEP, and sued HEP for the unpaid bills. In 1999, HEP counter-sued for damages because of lack of supply. In January 2001, the leaders of the two countries agreed on equal ownership of the Krško plant, joint responsibility for the nuclear waste, and the compensation of mutual claims.  The joint management of the plant was to begin on January 1, 2002.  The plant was expected to start supplying Croatia with electricity by July 1, 2002 at the latest, but the connection was only established in 2003 because of protests from the local population. Since then, HEP has additionally sued the Slovenian side for damages during the latest one-year period when Krško wasn't supplying power to it.</p>
<p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/37257.xml">
nuclear waste</link> from the plant is currently being stored nearby. The retirement site near Krško will be filled to capacity by 2011, by which time additional sites will need to be set up. Croatia also has a contractual obligation to take in one half of the nuclear waste by 2025.</p>
<p>

The planned retirement date is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../192/16192.xml">
January 14</link>, <fundamental_quantity wordnetid="113575869" confidence="0.8">

. The decommissioning plan that was ratified by Slovenian and Croatian parliaments schedules the start of disassembly shortly after that, and the taking apart of the plant would last until 2036.</p>

 (ECURIE). The power plant was safely shut down to a secure mode after a small <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../923/3074923.xml">
leak</link> in the cooling circuit. The leak was immediately located and treated. According to the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (the country's nuclear watchdog agency), no radioactive release into the environment occurred and none is expected. The event did not affect employees, the nearby population or the environment
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>. Slovenian authorities immediately alerted the proper international institutions, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and ECURIE. The EU then notified (through ECURIE) the remaining EU member states, issuing a EU-wide alert. Several news agencies around the world then reported on the incident<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref>. According to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../233/12233.xml">
Greenpeace</link> such a EU-wide alert is very unusual.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref>. Surprisingly, the <country wordnetid="108544813" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../573/5573.xml">
Croatia</link></country>
n authorities were not directly informed about the incident, although Craitia is particant to the ECURIE system<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref>. Many Croatians heard the news first trough foreign media and expatriates, although Krško is located a mere 15 km from the Croatian border<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref>.</p>
<p>

According to Nuclear Expertise groups, national entities within the European union, such as the <link>
ASN</link> in France, this incident was wrongly reported to ECURIE. ECURIE, when receiving a notification, has an obligation to forward it to all parties. In this particular situation, the notification turned out to be useless (i.e., false alarm). This type of incidents (a small leakage on primary pumps) are not a rare occurrence in nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>

Also, an incorrect form was used to report this incident to the other states in Europe. The error, however, was noticed and corrected within 5 minutes by a telephone call.</p>
<p>

This incident resulted in a relatively large amount of media attention for what was a minor incident. This raised questions over the procedures for reporting nuclear accidents in Europe.</p>
