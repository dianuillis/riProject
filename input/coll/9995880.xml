During its history, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../233/12233.xml">
Greenpeace</link> has been criticized by a number of groups. These include governments, industry and political lobbyists and some environmental groups.  The organization's use of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../755/178755.xml">
nonviolent direct action</link> has also caused controversy.</p>

Some critics have said the organisation is too mainstream. <physical_entity wordnetid="100001930" confidence="0.8">

Greenpeace had summarily shut down its community-building operations, terminating more than 300 employees in the US alone, in what Mr Angel called "a betrayal".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

A prominent critic of Greenpeace is Icelandic filmmaker Magnus Gudmundsson, director of a documentary <it>Survival in the High North</it>. Gudmundsson's criticisms have focused largely on the social impacts of anti-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../557/33557.xml">
whaling</link> and anti-sealing campaigns, while  Gudmundsson's documentary was judged <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../661/28661.xml">
libel</link>lous by a Norwegian court in 1992 and he was ordered to pay damages to Greenpeace. Similarly, a Danish tribunal held that the allegations against Greenpeace about faking video materials were unfounded. Many media that published Gudmundsson's allegations have subsequently retracted and apologized (e.g. the <it>Irish Sunday Business Post</it> and TVNZ). </p>

A moratorium on the dumping of offshore installations was almost immediately adopted in Europe, and three years later the Environment Ministers of the countries bordering the North East Atlantic agreed with Greenpeace, and adopted a permanent ban on the dumping of offshore installations at sea <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://archive.greenpeace.org/odumping/radioactive/reports/odhistory.pdf">
(PDF)</weblink>. After the occupation of the Brent Spar it became known that Shell had misled the public as to the amount of toxic wastes on board the installation. Greenpeace admitted that its claims that the Spar contained 5000 tons of oil were inaccurate and apologized to Shell on <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../990/27990.xml">
September 5</link>. However Greenpeace dismissed the issue of the amount of oil, saying that the main issue was one of wider industrial responsibility: as the first offshore installation to be dumped in the North East Atlantic, the Brent Spar would have been followed by dozens or hundreds more, thereby setting what Greenpeace considers to be a dangerous precedent. It also pointed out that the decision by Shell to scrap the Brent Spar had been taken before the incorrect amount of toxic waste was published by Greenpeace, and therefore that its mistake could not have influenced Shell's decision.</p>

"Since the early 1970s, DDT has been banned in industrialised countries and the interdiction was gradually extended to malarious countries...because of environmental concerns... Despite objections by notable malariologists...the move away from spraying houses was progressively strengthened by WHO's malaria control strategies of 1969, 1979, and 1992...were adopted even though published WHO documents and committee reports have consistently and accurately characterised DDT-sprayed houses as the most cost effective and safe approach to malaria control...assistance from industrialised countries was often specifically contingent on not using DDT"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref> Dr. D.R.

Currently, Greenpeace has members serve on boards for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../767/1035767.xml">

genetically modified crops</link>. He stated that "the campaign of fear now being waged against genetic modification is based largely on fantasy and a complete lack of respect for science and logic."</p>

Greenpeace spends roughly $12 million annually on campaigns against genetically modified crops, and have thereby encouraged governments to establish regulation which an industry funded lobby group, AgBioWorld claims is overly restrictive.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> </p>

Among other anti-GMO campaigns, Greenpeace opposes <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../458/246458.xml">
golden rice</link>. The alternative proposed by Greenpeace is to discourage <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../646/1635646.xml">
mono-cropping</link> and to increase production of crops which are naturally nutrient rich (containing other nutrients not found in golden rice in addition to beta-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../986/6986.xml">

Nuclear power</st>
<p>

Greenpeace has been accused of downplaying the benefits of nuclear power by indicating that nuclear power can only satisfy electrical power requirements, and not those for heating or transport.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref> Yet nuclear power could, through the electrical grid system, supply much of the energy demand for heating and transport energy requirements, and it has no 'end use' CO2 output. <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456932/html/nn5page1.stm">
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456932/html/nn5page1.stm</weblink> In terms of climate change from CO2 emissions, nuclear power is as 'environmentally friendly' as are wind turbines or solar arrays. After protesting about nuclear power for a number of years, Greenpeace now maintains that nuclear power stations cannot be built quickly enough to reduce our CO2 emissions before "it is too late."

Commentators have also noted that Greenpeace does not often express concerns about <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../257/37257.xml">
nuclear waste</link> - which is either a low-mass residuum (most nuclear reactors will 'burn' 2kg of U-235/U-238 fuel rods for 10 years of continuous output), which either is stored in incredibly tough/impermeable materials such as concrete, or is fully recyclable in a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../058/228058.xml">

Greener Electronics campaign</st>
<p>

In August 2006, Greenpeace released a "Guide to Greener Electronics," which ranked fourteen consumer electronics vendors in environmental issues. Greenpeace encouraged manufacturers to clean up their products by eliminating hazardous substances and to take back and recycle their products responsibly once they become obsolete. </p>
<p>

The Guide to Greener Electronics<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref> stated "the ranking is important because the amounts of toxic e-waste is [sic] growing everyday and it often ends up dumped in the developing world. Reducing the toxic chemicals in products reduces pollution from old products and makes recycling safer, easier and cheaper." It ranked <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../242/21242.xml">
Nokia</link></company>
 and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../490/102490.xml">
Dell</link> near the top, but essentially gave failing grades across the industry, ranking <company wordnetid="108058098" confidence="0.9508927676800064">
<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../703/59703.xml">
Toshiba</link></company>
 thirteenth, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../856/856.xml">
Apple Computer</link> in eleventh place out of the fourteen brands. The report singled out Apple for its low rank, saying: "Already, many of the companies are in a race to reach the head of the class - that is, except for Apple, who seems determined to remain behind rather than be the teacher's pet we'd hoped for." This caught the attention of tech media news sites, and was widely reported. Greenpeace gave Nintendo a score of 0.3 / 10 is based on the fact that Greenpeace has almost no information on the company, which by Greenpeace's grading system, automatically results in a zero for the affected categories.</p>
<p>

Daniel Eran of <link>
RoughlyDrafted Magazine</link> criticized the guide in an article,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref> saying the Greenpeace guide's "ranking puts far more weight upon what companies publicly say rather than what they actually do. It is also clear that Greenpeace intended the report more as an attention getting stunt than a serious rating of corporations' actual responsibility." In response, Greenpeace attacked Roughly Drafted's credibility, pointing out that it has in the past been called "the lunatic fringe of Mac fandom" by other bloggers after comparing the cost of <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/660E746C-F388-4AC7-98F5-6CB951501472.html">
Windows and Mac OS X</weblink>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref></p>
<p>

It is in fact alleged that Greenpeace has had no factual evidence, instead relying on unsubstantiated official company information for the report in order to garner publicity, as well as political and monetary support. The Environmental Protection Agency's <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.epeat.net/">
EPEAT</weblink> shows Apple leading the ranks in all categories. ArsTechnica called the Greenpeace report <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/1/6/6507">
a fraud</weblink> after factual substantiation was questioned.</p>
<p>

Greenpeace responded to the criticisms in a rebuttal also published by RoughlyDrafted. Along with the Greenpeace rebuttal, the article<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref> further presented the results of a second Greenpeace report, called "Toxic Chemicals in Your Laptop Exposed," which Roughly Drafted called an 'apology' for the initial claims Greenpeace made in the Greener Guide rankings. While Greenpeace itself has never used the word "apology", they did restate several of their initial claims in a response to Keith Ripley, another reviewer of the report.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref> For example, the data reported findings of minimal traces of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../137/11855137.xml">
TBBPA</link>, an unregulated fire retardant in the Apple computer; the Greenpeace press release said Apple "appears to be using far more of this toxic chemical than its competitors".  This is despite the fact that the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks concluded in March of 2005 that TBBPA "presents no risk to human health"<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2235%22])">35</ref> and "the World Health organisation conducted a scientific assessment of TBBPA and found that the risk for the general population is considered to be insignificant."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2236%22])">36</ref></p>
<p>

More criticism of the statement in the Greenpeace press release followed in:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2237%22])">37</ref> "The most recent report, 'Toxics in Your Laptop Exposed,' did credible scientific tests, but then threw out the data to instead present a lathered up, misleading and deceptive press release that was simply a lie. No amount of credible science is worth anything if you ignore the findings and simply present the message you wanted to the data to support."</p>
<p>

Greenpeace published an article on its website, addressing the criticism so far, with a special focus on scientific issues.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2238%22])">38</ref></p>
